9394,"Violence unleashed, show no apathy
Time for revenge has come
The war dogs have been released
With an infinite thirst for blood

Kill 'em all, fear none!
Crush your enemies, make them pay for their sins
Punishment awaits, subjected to servitude

Pure wrath, pure hate
We must retaliate!
Inflict the pain!
Destruction, nothing remains

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!

Cowards shall be slain!
Bodies left to die, soon to meet your creator
Mankind martyrized!
Dead souls ascending to the skies
Pure wrath, pure hate
We must retaliate!
Inflict the pain!
Destruction, nothing remains

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!

Desperation slowly fills the void, as you beg for mercy
I despise your insides, I laugh at your pathetic sorrow
Pull the pieces back together and shut your fucking mouth
The time to die is now, emptiness awaits!

Triumphant, victory shall resonate
Across the lands with pride we march
Punishment, surrendering is not an option
Merciless laughter will be the last thing you hear

The final conclusion is near
I feed upon the fear in your eyes

Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!
Holocaust, tell me how you feel about dying today!
Holocaust, tell me how it feels to be condemned to suffer!",rock

She was a neighborhood local at her local bar
With shoulder length brown hair and an accent I found fairly rare
One part country one part urban thug total fox
I was out of my element
New to the neighborhood and clearly lacking friends
Just adding to the mess of white ball caps and red keg cups
Dropping home values and raising rent
After the pause things became confusing
She asked ""Are you a real man or a college student?""
I did not know what to say I'd started school that very day
Which is nothing but a big business I suppose
Right then and there my heart did drop
She turned and walked away without a second thought
I should have listened to my dad when he said ""Work with your hands not your head
And your billfold will stay full and you won't be paying out debt""
So men the purpose of this song
Is to go ahead and pass my father's wisdom on
Go on and callous up those hands learn some knots and turn a wrench
Cause in four years there won't be any jobs left anyway
If I'd taken my old man's advice
I might be laid up in the bed beside that fox tonight
Instead my mouth tastes like jello shooters and I'm lurking her on this darn computer

To the other side on the down low

Take your time and get your fill
Dust moves on the floor
It’s my head behind your door

We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide

Work your art and do it well
Took the road to live in hell
The past is dead and now is now
Escape the reaper with our vow

Our sins and thoughts are cleansed inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Brother brother heal me
Death has come to pray
Woman woman heal me
Doom is where I lay

The blood haunts abandoned stone
We pour the wine to make it gone
Someone had to make a mess
Game of chess no pieces left

We give our souls and find tomorrow
We laugh in death and kill the pain
Our sins and thoughts are left inside
Darkness the cave in which I hide
Brother brother hear me
Watch the words you say
Father father hear me
Doom is where I lay
Woman woman hear me
Watch the words you say

Calm your heart and make it still
Take your time and get your fill

From across the halo of the beautiful Earth
Summer and winter caught a glimpse
Just a glimpse began the wretched birth
Of an endless love between her and him (no speed of light, no speed of sound, no speed of light, forever)

Summer left his message in the seed
That winter held back to her heart
Their prayers will lean on December winds
And the answer was the heart is apart

CHORUS:
(no speed of light)
No speed of light
No speed of sound
(no speed of sound)
Meet either one
Spin fast around
(no speed of light)
No speed of sound
No speed of light
So forever (forever), forever
We can never be together

By the time I’m gone
You’ll forget my name

I want someone here to take my place

5988,"Maniac' the name is Swift
Homicidal the title, to take a life as a gift
Cold crush, rhyme, rhyme, lady, scratch, and even music maker
Bounce an' MC on the court like a ball player
Proven by the lyrics on the mike as I extend the cut
Making music, as the girls move and shale their butts
Suckers with the heart, try to battle even cheat me
They can't compete, nor they defeat, or even beat me
With the silly dictionary rhymes they spond
When the mike catches fire, it will melt and bend
Then I'll use the court as a whip, as I teach this lesson
I'll whipe the knowledga in your head, so you can't stop guessing
Who's the best MC upon the MIC, SWIFT
Make your body get the shiversq, eyes dilated
Suckers perpetrate, and try to dis me
That's why the suckers watching me like TV
Survival of the fittest, is very vital
Got my weapon on auto, boy, I'm homicidal

Dangerous, mike packing and ill
My peotry is my ammo, and it's ready to kill
I'll put your head out with a quickness if we battle you know
I'll make you wish you were in prison, sitting on death row
Chrome plated, highly polished, and I'm running the joint
I penetrate, like a hollow point
Homicidal, is what I feel in my mind
I have 100 ways to kill you while I'm saying this rhyme
Perpetrators, can't even compare to this
I cock the hammer, pull the trigger and dis
Sucker MCs biting rhymes like these
I'll point my weapon in your face and then I'll start to squeeze
Your mind get's nervous, your face is cold sweating
Beacuse a butt-kickings, what you're getting
I lived a rough life from kid to a man
When I think of things I've done I say ""Damn !""
What's the deal, you know it's real
Always feeling illy ill, my mind just says kill
I'm never wrong, then again I'm not right ya'll
Menace I'm homicidal
Swift the name, dissin' MCs the game
To dis a sucker MC is the claim of my fame
I like to grabthem by the face, punching them in the neck
Burning up their stale rhymes, 'till they give me respect
Cold destruction is a code, causing rapper's commotion
Setting world on fire like a TNT explosion
Rhyme, not a song, I neither sang nor I sung
I can cut a man to shreds, or break a tree with my tongue
Got my face on a poster, wanted dead or alive
Reward tall ""duckies"" four thousand or five
If you want to take the ""duckies"" wish yourself a good luck
Cuz I kill in cold bood and I don't give a fuck
Come along or bring your posse, play brave and the bold
I'll be rocking, cold shocking, 'till I'm 80 years old
Proud and I'm black, giving squeezers no slack
I'm even deadlier then PCP caine and crack
I'm the mercenary, killing punks at will
I hate it when the brothers are acting ill
It's time to get busy, and fight ya'll
Word, I'm homicidal",pop

But nothin's impossible except livin' without breathin'
So if you run up I'll pop at you until your scalp's leakin'
And come to the hospital when you layin' down sleepin'
And snuffin' the doctor too and tellin' him, ""Now treat him!""
I'm knockin' out thugs if they talkin' loud buzz
Rocky style, watch your mouth, 'cause I box without gloves
Cut 'em wide open, with a hunting knife, poke 'em!
I'm puffin' lye hopin' I can justify smokin'
Like in the old days, we lived in gold caves
Smoked J's and got so blazed, we called it ""the stone age""

No fun gettin' acky, I'm trigger happy with no gun
So beware of the vicious pit, hoes get near to kiss this dick
But ask me to eat the pussy and I'll pierce a bitch's clit
I'm here to get the chips: fat kid at a vending machine
Spendin' the green to my last cent 'til I split at the seams
The best MC, so testin' me
Is like expectin' to graduate college with F's and D's
I'm a product of Slick Rick, was brought up on Will Smith
Scarface, lines I write are narcotic so sniff sniff
I came in the game nice, like ""Backgammon anyone?""
I'ma leave it mean as a demon backhandin' everyone
Pulled the baby 9 out, blew a lady's spine out
Shot once then got drunk with Amy Winehouse

Miyagi karate master, watch your body fracture

Yeah, your jaw'll prob'ly shatter
I stood the test of time, you copied off my answers
Repeatin' what you hear like Polly wanna cracker
I hope your noggin rots of cancer
And your life flashes like paparazzi cameras
That spot accomplished actors
So move it back, I'm provin' that my crew can rap
A ruthless pack of sewer rats, you'll get chewed in half
Do the math, I tear that ass apart
Once the battle starts, you trapped in Jurassic Park after dark
Nah, I don't have to battle no more

I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'
And I'm sippin' on a little somethin'-somethin'
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
Mama's cornbread still bumpin'
And my brother's always gettin' into somethin'
K5 full of honkies goin' muddin' (Damn straight)
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country

[Verse 1: Upchurch]
Lift kits and big tits, dip and beer, though (Hell naw)
Is that what these folks think I'm really here for?
Hell no, so put your eyes on me and let me tell you what I think
Take it how you want it, my opinion shouldn't make a blank (Hell naw)
Hick-hop, what a word, google that term
I ain't a part of any clique or any gang or any work
I ain't no damn idiot just beggin' for acceptance (Hell naw)
I'm here to tell you how I always be rebellin'
I used to put RC Cans in the wheel of my bicycle
Now I'm rolling on 35's, chill as a icicle
Yeah, I came up from nothin', now my phone is constantly buzzin'
'Cause somebody told somebody they had to come tell me something, I'll love it
I'm nothing but a Tennessee country bumpkin with Cali
Colorado, Kentucky and Alabama, bumpin', what's up (Ah yeah)
Small town but I'm doin' big shit (Cheatham County)
Backwoods, got it tatted on my skin
[Chorus:  Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'

And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country

[Verse 2: Upchurch]
Tennessee time tickin', Kentucky Fried Chicken
Buy a junky ass truck, spray paint it, with gears missin'
I'm on mission of gettin' people to listen in Dixie
And whistle to all the lyrics, the hell of a team spirit
I'm cold boy shit slick but I won't get stuck
Unregistered guns layin' in the back of the truck
Hah, to hell with everybody I could stop givin' a shit (Fuck It)
My neck of the woods is known to be super thick
Th-th-thunder roll like a Tennessee hailstorm
Let the camera flashes flood you like a river bound mobile home
Cut the haters, knock me down, wallow some old bricks
I'm still a fuckin' beast comin' out of the damn sticks (Ah yeah)
People used to talk me down, now they wanna call me up
Ex's wanna message me after they done drank enough
Talkin' 'bout they miss me and they never wanna cheat again
Sorry I'm too busy layin' with a Puerto Rican chick
[Chorus: Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm going huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'

'Round the world 30 times still country he stay (He stay)
Out in Nashville we're stuffin' D Wade
Just up in Cheatham County to hunt for three days (Three days)
With Upchurch it must hurt to know (Woo)
The next schedule's rockin' with the first to show (What)
These country boys know how to get get get it
Made me 20 mil but I spent spent spent it
On trucks and guns and it was fun
Never waste time or regret the shit is done (Nope)
I've been known to chatter and never matter
Haters hate it when you keep goin' they never sadder
Them Mickey T's still hummin' and hummin'
And that Bubba K shit still bumpin' and sumptin'
Small towns and all around the US
We keep it country dog 'cause that is what we do best

I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'

Told me the things I don't do could never be forgiven
I guess we had a good show, but ended our transmission
She said just fight for me, I asked what is it worth
With all this fighting I feel like this gift has now become a curse
One day you were the were the best but now it just feels like the worst
You asked for so much and dug a grave for us, ain't need a hearse
But why you do that? I swear you're always testin'

Wondering if you stay, ponder if I should leave
I know I have a habit to throw my heart on my sleeve

With all these negatives I read you like its old news
You're so predictable, changing it up is minimal
In your eyes and the things I've been hearing lately are criminal
Why are you being fictional saying that we're invisible?
Arguments should have never felt like they could be typical
Taking everything literal, acting so pitiful
Walkin' around so miserable what happened to all the principles
Of a relationship, why the hell am I hatin' this
Makin' this work, I think that we should be vacationin
Lost all the intimacy, now it's an acquaintanceship
Was searchin for your heart but now I ain't locatin' it

An awful taste can turn you off forever

I can't even tell who I am anymore
To shut my eyes and to never be seen
What the fuck is happening to me?
Between two entities, holding onto the edge
I don't know how much more I can take before I fall and descend
Whispering in my ear
“No one will miss you, just disappear.”

But we won't be skipped and swayed
Trapped within these walls, you left our souls to drip away

But Mary Gray's two cheeky eyes caused all my fancy falter

Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes

Betsy's hair's like flaxen gold, she smiles like a May morning
When Phoebus starts from Thoetus lap the hills with rays adorning
White is her hair, soft is her hand, her waist and feet flow gently
With every grace she can command, her lips I vow are dainty

Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes

Mary's locks are like the crow, her eyes like diamond's glances
She's aye so clean red up and raw, she kills whene'er she dances
Blithe as a kid with wit and will, she's blooming, tight and tall is
And guides her airs so graceful still, oh Jove, she's like thy palace
Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes

Young Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, ye unco saer oppress us
Our fancies fee between ye two, ye are such bonnie lassies
Woe's me for both I cannot get, to one by law we're stinted
Then I'll draw straws and take my fate and be with one contented

Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lassies
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes
But Betsy Belle nor Mary Gray could quell my fancy ever

[Verse 1]
Come a little closer it's a feeling that I can't deny
I was weak, but I never thought I'd speak about the darker side
Is that a tent? I could repent upon the side of the road
But, I kept on going yeah I headed for another load
I get up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

[Verse 2]
I was laid upon the grave by a preacher's hand I cannot lie
And, I forsake the many vows I made to be with you tonight
Could you be the salvation cause I never felt like this before
And, could you lend me your hand because I'm falling back on the floor

Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground in the middle of the night
Oh, I testify

On a road outside of nowhere, in the middle of the night
Well I guess I hit rock bottom and the dawn was not in sight
And a Tempest made of fire, onset the sky aglow
And a sweet young thing called out my name
And this is how it goes, she says ....
'Go boy, can you hear them? Are you falling through the cracks in your eyes?'
And I got down on my knees

[Chorus]
I get up from the ground in the middle of the morning
Up from the ground in the middle of the evening
Up from the ground and I'm falling back down
Up from the ground and I testify

[Verse 3]
Every cut that heals reveals a scar that you can never hope to hide
All the pain that you restrain keeps buildings up deep inside
If you think you're above it then it's you my friend that I implore
You've got to walk before you run
See the night before dawn
Before you pull yourself off the floor

A restraining order and a lawsuit from your parents that year
My mother and father abused me after that, I was scared
I wanted to die
After all that mess, was put into therapy, and an asylum. They wouldn’t believe me, they said I was a psycho
Somehow during those asylum days, I wasn’t insane
Took some pills and sometimes the memory fades, but now I’m still getting flashbacks ever since that day, now I was involved in music

To what's right in front of you
How can you be so blind

An open heart to misguided clones

Shoved beneath the floorboards

Pulls you under
Can't you see it's face?
Drowning you in disbelief
Can't you feel the weight?
It crosses your mind as you wonder
It's staring back in your face
Pale eyes and they terrorize
And making its way into my brain
Casting all this fear aside
And pushing this bitch away
Oh my god
Ignorance is the death of me
Rip out the tongue
Of innocence

Don't ever worry about what's in the darkness that awaits you
Don't ever worry about how long it takes
You'll get there
Don't ever worry about the ones that don't encourage you
Don't ever worry about

Won't You come and make me whole again

While yo bitch is sucking dick

Cus you can’t count up these chips

Got a 40 on my hip and I might let that shit go bang
Tie a rope around ya neck I’m slicing tendons and yo veins

Leave you bleeding reaching out but nobody gon hear you scream
And you IKNOW you preaching now but
Yo god is not here to save

Blue strips is what I’m counting bitch
Rebel like I’m rowdy bitch
Spit and hawk  up on my dick

Pimping hoes for a flip
Hit the road for a lick

With every little step she'd take
She'd get one step closer to leaving

She listened to the washing machine
Just wishing that she could leave
But there were so many loads to clean

She could hear it in her head sometimes
Like the change that she was saving in a jar
And the chains on the front porch swing
Were creaking like steps in the dark

One day soon this is all gonna end
One day soon maybe it'll all begin

He'd tell it to her all the time
He was the best thing she'd ever see
Oh he was stomping up and down the hall

Out from under this rock that you stone me with
It don't mean shit
Whatever stone you skip another home is hit
To close to call it something I love
It's something i'm not quite sure of
I learned to deal and keep the ace inside my sleeve and shrug my shoulders
Playing dumb making it fun the game's already won
I'm just trying to hold onto what's left before it's done
I've got no God to take it out on, i'm out on my own
No watch or cellphone, my hoodies reek of weed smoke and not cologne
I'm looking like a skeleton, i've shed so many skins
And now I rock t-shirts from places i've never been
This one way's a dead end, i'm to far to turn back the hands of time that pantomime
I've learned to adapt
Jacks thinking outside the box now
With all these rocks i've found
There in my pockets
To keep me grounded and outta the clouds from pipe dreamers who just get smoked like John Lenin and Dr. King
Chased the tails and dream coats and half way I stopped to think
And stopped believing
Hidden reasons to keep breathing then get out
I passed a day without saying hi
Just keep my head down
It's the same sob story over coffee starts to bore me
Life's not short, you're too busy talking about whats wrong with me
Or the system, or the world, or your parents I keep my distance
Taking out my days one by one like they was victims
And i'll never win this battle, but i'll always dress for the war
And i'll throw down my weapon whenever I question my cause

Better late than never set to wake I wait for one
These days are getting old maybe because the night is young
I bite my tongue and breath this dead air exhale to cold stares
A walkman and headphones, forget home
Where do I go from here
Yellow brick roads are blocked
Becoming walls we stick up
And in between's the dreams we go tired of and get rid off
But i'm a man of few words
And plenty of change from penny's saved
My two cents break your dollars
I'll pass the buck anyway
We spend money and waste time
Expecting something back
But what I saved for wishing wells
Slipped through cracks and fell through sewer caps
It's nothing new, i've gotten used to it
And choose to laugh
It's either too good to be true
With setbacks, it'll never last
I settle for less than what it's worth, you always sell for more
So fear my cold hands that never rub lamps or sell doors
I've felt loss but I find my way around
Used to show my hands now I keep the cards I play with face down
A grey cloud nine follows behind my footsteps
What you see is as good as it gets
I keep this hood over my head
Working for rain checks and paying dues and debts
And a who slept
Count my blessings in disguise but can't recognized them yet but
Subtle change I run in place and come to face
Met my love at first sight and lost her with the double take
I keep my head above the waist
My soul is hard to sell
Most difficult work as an artist is to make something out of yourself

Bout a thousand times
Said I was done with you for good
But you’re still on my mind
Now I'm sitting here plotting
How to get you back
Knowing that what we had was rotten
And the same old trap
That we keep getting caught in
Over and over again
It’s all constant cycle
And it likely won’t end
Until the day we finally realize
That we’re better as friends
Or until the other night
When it all finally ended, cause
We both said somethings
That we shouldn’t have
And if we could
We’d probably take them back
But we both know now
It’s too late for that
It’s all in the past
Like what we could’ve had
Blinded by love
But i can finally see
I’m no good for you
You’re no good for me

Some good memories
That’s all in the past

You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance
Silver moon's sparkling
So kiss me
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight
Lead me out on the moonlit floor
Lift your open hand
Strike up the band and make the fireflies dance

Cutting down Algerians
Breaking heads all over town

The witnesses were run to the ground
Put the bastards underground
Buried every black in town

When the stars fall from the sky
When the world cannot make me cry
That's when the scales will fall from your eyes
And let you see the truth

Subjected to a murder crew
Well trained policemen charging through
A crowd that's armed with slogans
Yet no-one saw and no help came
And no-one wants to take the blame
These people that you try to tame
Will get round to you later
The protesters were run to the ground
Put the bastards underground
Buried every black in town
Who dared to raise his voice
Every day around the world

They have to live their life in fear
Yet something makes them stand and shout
One day they will find you out
Dig up every fact in town

I had no friends now I got them ringing up my
Phone
Saying “yo bro u will make it out u just gotta
Take it slow”
Now I’m stacking all these stacks
And I’m stacking all this dough

Chorus
Back then I had no funds
So I had to grind for some change
Back then we didn’t know about love
Now I have love for that range
Trackie and sliders
Man that shit weren’t the same
I had no trust
So I have to silence my pain
X2

Verse 2
I have to silence my pain
But now I’m living life gory
When I find the one
Imma find my self like dory
Find a sweet one that loves me for me
Never date a hoe
That only loves me for my ps
I only have a small circle
Cos there’s always fakes that want a hand out
Where was u when u didn’t wanna hang out?
I came from a good place
With a good heart
That’s a good back ground
Now I always see my heart break
Anytime I rap now

Chorus
Back then I had no funds
So I had to grind for some change
Back then we didn’t know about love
Now I have love for that range
Trackie and sliders
Man that shit weren’t the same
I had no trust
So I have to silence my pain
X2

Verse 3
Gotta silence this pain
Like every single day
Trynna find a way
To get paid today
If I make it out
Woukd u only love me for some papes
Now I’m grinding for these pounds
And I’m grinding for this cake
If I don’t make it out
I gotta take a different route
I’m gonna be the happiest kid
When I buy my family a house
I ain’t got time for them guys
Who really act like clowns

Chorus:
Back then I had no funds
So I had to grind for some change
Back then we didn’t know about love
Now I have love for that range

Now I have to silence my pain

Verse 4
When I had no funds
I didn’t know about rapping
Now I’m getting all these funds
But it ain’t from trapping
Them boys, some real life actors
I ain’t the one for drama
I can’t do no acting

Like a year ago it really felt like magic
All these girls asking for money
So my heart just vanished
See me in some moncler
I still know about fashion
Some of these so called day1s snaked me
To this day I don’t know what happened

Chorus:
Back then I had no funds
So I had to grind for some change
Back then we didn’t know about love
Now I have love for that range

And know it's love, and I wish I could show it
Interviews about where I'm from, cause they know where I'm going
It's kind of funny how a few words turn into fucking
Nowadays it's nuttin' more cause I've already done it
And nothing hurt more than heartbreak, when the start great
Thinking it's love, and learning it wasn't
And good girls come few and far between
Some nights I do it just to do it, I'm not sure what that mean
Just a little caught up in the game
But know the real me still remain
Hand to God, for real

Moonwalk to the money
I’m in my duffy while rockin' a skully
Got this Bape on my back, I ain't rockin’ no Stüssy
Lil' mama, she get all my time, then she lucky
But I ain't givin' these hoes my charm
I been goin' hard since I was young
I got some brothers that live and they die by the gun
I ain't got to invest so I'm focused on runnin' my funds up (Let’s go)

[Verse 1]
Ain’t nobody helpin' me, so I gotta focus on gettin’ that shit my own way
Got these hoes in rotation and I cannot trust 'em, so I gotta play 'em like 2K
Not into the politics, but I got it on me, I got no time for the parley
Hot nigga, feelin' like Bobby
Soon ’bout to box these rappers like I'm Roddy
I cannot go to no parties, nah (Nah-nah)
I cannot trust who she been around (Let's go)

Ran this shit up, never got no allowance
From the back, I've been swiped and I'm used to the struggle
I came from the islands
Havin' fun in this shit, man, a nigga freestylin'
Money been changin' my mood
Freaky bitches hit it off with the crew
I got money and it's stuck up on my mind (On my mind)
Baby girl, you know I cannot waste no time
My mother love gone, but this money flowin' (It's flowin')
Money language, I speak that shit fluent

Anesthetized and subdued
Destined to an opaque reality
The righteous path obscured

Happiness is miles away
It takes about seven days to get there
And if you want I'll be your man
I'll take you by your weathered hand and show you where
But my history is one big pit
Of bad mistakes with no regrets left to speak of
Still somewhere on that winding path
Beneath the rubble of the aftermath there is love
Now I'm living in a desolate world
Another one night stand, another nameless girl beside me
She has a face that I have seen before
In every lonely girl at the bar that's tried me
Now I'm swimming through the after stench
Of an evening so passionate, yet empty
I grab my clothes off the floor
Stumble through the darkness towards the door
And say, ""Honey, I am leaving""
She got up outta bed
Never bothering to get dressed and came toward me
That's when I realized
I wasn't just like every other guy before me
She said ""You don't have to but if you choose""
""You can stay another day or two, you won't regret it""
That's when the strangest thing occurred
I said I was in love with her and I actually meant it
[Verse 2]
Now I was trying to think logically
But the bedroom smell and her beauty were distractions
I shuttered at impulsiveness
And tried my best to make some sense of my reactions
Now in the past I have been in love
At least I, I think I was once
But it could of just been consequence
Or some chemical imbalance that I called love
Still analysis is my disease
So I allow my conscious to reprieve my emotions
I addressed her and she agreed
It would be best for us to proceed with caution
So I ran my fingers up her naked back
And kissed the crescent of her neck sweetly
She was soaking wet with impatience
She let out a sigh of eagerness discreetly
That's when she reached down for me
With the softest hands I've had the luxury of knowing
She leaned down and kissed my thigh
Both my loving and lustful sides were showing
On the bathroom floor, we made love
After which I placed here in the tub and ran the water
I baptized her with my respect
And washed all of myself off of her",pop

Something else to drain your energy
Something more weighs on your mind
Something more that’s keeping you from me

As you fade from my view
Where are you?
You’re not here when you should care
Reaching out for your hand
But it’s not there
Hide and seek
You’re not here

Somewhere else is beckoning
Somewhere else is hidden in plain sight
Somewhere else is my retreat
Somewhere else is shelter deep inside
Floating on the sea

Rocked me like a boat:

Yeah, you got me open
Fixed me like a potion

They say if you follow your desire eventually will be your turn
And so I say burn ba ba burn burn burn
Up next is my turn ta ta turn turn turn

They think they can control us with all of their lies
And then try to console us, tears don't fall from evil eyes
And so I say burn ba ba burn burn burn
Wait till they all learn la la learn learn learn

In my orbit I admit you’ll see all that you intend

We don't win this way, call it quits
Then regroup pull out magic tricks
Delete the dupes who ain't with this
Train more troops let em reminisce
Enemies to the abyss
‘Tis the time for all of this
Chosen ones no longer sit
Anything worth it has a risk
Lost my wits due to the brain splits
Drained, confused and prone to fits
We will overcome all this
Just believe you can do it


My powers slowly building
A fire within gains Speed
The enemies are chilling
But We’ll turn them to ash indeed

Heavenly it is, when I rock with the truth
This for the youth mostly
But the old can bounce to this
Once upon a time in Nazareth, the Son came in flesh to manifest the grace
Now I run my own race and flex how I wanna
As I stick to the code 116
And I still insist, the only way in is through Yeshua
I am certain the future is now, He got the keys
My geez are by the door, waiting for the final signal
The sample been talking to y’all, let us get into the action
Ain’t no Pierce round here though, we gon’ die another day bruv (we gon’ die another)
Here comes the debates (the debates) now y’all wanna check the dates (the dates)

Verse 3: Reap3r
Gotta push the meditation, all my homies elevating
Now we stress the need to win, it ain’t enough to be on 2
Take your time to hear His voice, it’s always pleasing towards Him
Do not check the sin again, for y’all know we have been revived
So as we pushing further towards pineal goals, God knows I got the sight on goal
No need to be stressing, He is in the kitchen, no need to be broke, He is the bank
If the world is demanding, then I will be flying and He will be coaching as we all proceed
The creed of apostles, the word is the shovel, don’t throw in the towel, in God I just ball
My dreams are too tall, that’s how I roll, throw the devil in a pit with a bowl
God on the phone, He got the stones, now I am home with the David sauce
My sisters pull in with the Esther dance, still I rock on with the Jesus bands
The prayers cashing our advances, ain’t no Coca-Cola for this gladness
We all rock to the Francis (rock to the Francis) then we skip to the Chris (skip to the Chris)
Maybe they want Emmanuel (they want Emmanuel) but the source is the same (source is the same)
Once upon a time I had no sauce, now I got that with the bottle (that with the bottle)
Blame it on Jesus (blame it on Jesus) for He taught me to surf (church)

Let your lips kiss my crown when we walk thru our souls

And tap in-deep to my field
Like a human magnet how it comes into view

All the things wе release
That don’t really serve us

And use my power to teach

Out all this love in the air and watch it turn my way (way, way, way)
All these eons that we walked beyond
We came right from the ground to the sky like lightning
The clouds fill heavy with a purpose
I know Its really worth it
Let me orbit round your frame and proportions
I do the math and I really see your on it
What’s the science?
This love I can't deny it
My life I finally found it
All in divine timing

I don't mean to be that way, the xanny drop all on my tongue
The LSD just keep on walking, xanny still got me walking
Caught up in my mind, I think I be the one to leave behind
Leave me alone, no ringtone, still be all up in my zone
Phone keep on ringing, iPhone 6, trapping out the back
Momma told me fix myself, but money talking right back
Look me in the face if you want to hold up that shit
Pull up in the pit, and I'll pull up in a truck, and I'll pull up, really don't really give a damn, fuck
Young nigga had to go and get it out the grove
Still be the young nigga cooking on the stove
Gucci Mane out here, but it's leavemealone, leave me alone, aye

Look me straight in the damn eye
You cannot be the one who can lie
Telling me all them lies, try

But it's double or nothing, so I put 100 on that
Gamble my mental for change outta pocket, and xanny stay talking the smack
Have to wonder when ima go back
Look at the metal man, straight in the face, if you wonder 'bout that, yuh
Say it a-say it again, I'm a fool
Say it again, I can't rest, but I snooze
Feel like Vegeta, the alien demon, I slay waterfalls with the blues, aye
Tower is calling from underworld plane, and the rose in the cracks growing outta my name
Set the trap card, face-down like your shawty that I spell cast
Summon pale dragons from a deck full of new cash, aye
Please, do not disturb the necromancer, when he be walking
Asking questions, when I know that ain't no one answer
I refuse to see my shadow from the spotlight of the Capricorn, residing in my metronome
Inside of my head, let me mourn for metal embryo, aye
I'm at your place, please let me in, you invited me here, fuck you mean I can wait?
Said I was born with the sin that I carry today
Do not disturb, I'm on do not disturb

Aye, aye, what you offering me?

Niggas try leave me dead in the streets

Lost chicken Kuz I was in beef

Remember had holes in my sneaks

Now I'm Fuckin These Hoes Of My Sneaks

Sometimes the same clothes for a week

Now I'm switching these hoes every week

It was times that I couldn't get sleep

Niggas Pillow Talkin I Peeped

Niggas undercover no sheets
Niggas Main bitch Is my freak

Ribs touching that's hunger

No bread nor wonder

I was stuck in Some shit

FElt Just like a plumber

Same shit every summer

Lost friends I wanna

In Jail & Down Under

Sometimes I wonder

Would I be next on the list

If I shoot I ain't shootin to miss

Ain't met a hoe yet that I miss

Niggas Clowns So they trick on bitch
Went from g shocks to the Rollie

From A hunnit niggas to me dollie

Still stay strap wit a pollie

Gotta watch for the police

Older now different mindset

2 boys that ain't mine yet

Baby moms on slime shit

I guess it ain't my time yet

I pray to lord every night

Fuck It mask on future bright

Somebody gotta pay the price

Somebody try to take my life

Into it wit Bros I was kool wit
No 1 man above the whole crew shit

Till them backs turn on some fu shit

Made A Nigga Change On Some new shit

Be the same nigga that a pop You

Hit you from a certain angle

Treat You Like A Op To (Obtuse)

From where Good girls turn into hoes

Clip long check the measurement

Shootin like a young veteran

It was times that I couldn't afford shit

I kno wat it is to take loses

Stomach pain made a nigga nauseous

For trafficking & Gettin Paper

The rats watchin like neighbors

Till we play like exterminator

Niggas play the block like a center

Till we pop out in That sprinter

Every nigga wit me Gang

Then she became a slave in ancient Athens
She doesn't know quite how it happened
Now she paints faces in the city

Take a good luck around, son
Why should anyone here be saved?""

9862,"I still don’t think of you as long or often as I feel I used to
And conversations turn to feuds when every word is misconstrued
Someday's it’s tough to picture us as lovers when we’re bored and old
Like clothes straight from the dryer, we both know that it is time to fold

We can both find anyone else
Or we could waste our lives away
Better to let you know

Get off my back
I walked a line
But you let it slide
We slipped through the cracks
Little heart attacks
But we let us die

The clocks not going backward
It’s too late to grasp on to the past
A fire is a fire
The flames don’t care about who lit the match
One step forward five steps back and now you wanna come around
You used to have a spotlight
I know I should have shoved you in the background
I should, I should
We can both find anyone else
Or we could waste our lives away
Better to let you know

Get off my back
I walked a line
But you let it slide
We slipped through the cracks
Little heart attacks
But we let us die
You’re never here
I’m never there
It’s too late to retry
And now we’re both a mess
We’re miserable at best
It’s time to say goodbye

If I’m just being honest, when you’re gone it’s not so different
It’s easy to move on when you get over it

You can hunt for anyone else
Or this could waste your life away
Just thought I’d let you know

Get off my back
I walked a line
But you let it slide
We slipped through the cracks
Little heart attacks
But we let us die
You’re never here
I’m never there
It’s too late to retry
And now we’re both a mess
We’re miserable at best

Went from valentino’s on my shoes to a tan suit
23 hours in your cell with nun to do
What you know bout eating slop
Talking to brick walls
Tagged a brick on the wall like “free mars”

Tried to tie me to a shooting but they had no evidence i still shot with percision

I'm shooting the ruger piston this is
Malaysian sweatshop death rock hip hop
From the home of shell top Adidas and Red Sox and it don't stop

7923,"In 1971, Navy Lt. John F. Kerry asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”
How do you ask a man to be the first man to die for a mistake?

This week, Secretary of State John F. Kerry came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to make his case for war with Syria — a war that a majority of Americans don’t want, the administration still can’t clearly justify and for which Mr. Kerry himself made a very poor case.

A war that Mr. Kerry even refuses to call a war — at least not in the “classic sense,” he assures us.

The American people certainly see this as a potential new war, and the country is war-weary. After well over a decade in Iraq and Afghanistan, they are not eager to commit to another questionable intervention. Americans also know that whatever assurances this administration pretends it can give — that there will not be boots on the ground, that this will not be a protracted engagement — are all negotiable once the war actually begins.

The Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney writes: “Some members of Congress say they’ll support a limited strike on Syria. But this is a fantasy. It relies on limiting two things that naturally defy limit: war and presidential power.”

Mr. Carney continues: “War cannot be tamed. War might turn out according to plan (for everyone who didn’t get killed or maimed), but that’s largely a matter of chance. Men cannot control war — not even with the greatest military ever; not even with chants of ‘Yes, we can’; not even with a Nobel Peace Prize.”

To the extent that Mr. Kerry made a case at all — along with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel — the secretary was not very convincing. Even as the committee predictably approved authorization of the use of military force, the administration still failed to demonstrate any clear national security connection the United States has in Syria. The supposed justification for intervention to stop the use of chemical weapons still does not tell us how military action would actually deter their use. We’re still not absolutely sure about the origins of their use.

What we can be fairly sure of is that we will be helping rebel groups in Syria who are affiliated with al Qaeda. President Obama might not be able to articulate a national interest, but any American with memory can recognize a potential powder-keg component of this situation that should make us at least wary of helping the rebels. President George W. Bush promised in 2001, “We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.” Are we now on the eve of giving military shelter to the same people who attacked us on Sept. 11?

This is the elephant in the room that Mr. Kerry and nearly every other politician in support of war with Syria refuse to talk about. They can laugh or scoff all they want, and they can act as though the rebel group al-Nusra won’t benefit from our efforts, but the enemy of our enemy Mr. Assad is not our friend — and he is still our enemy.

No reasonable person can look at the tragedy in Syria and not condemn the atrocities. However, what America can reasonably be expected to do about it is an entirely separate question. Neither Mr. Kerry nor anyone else in this administration has been able to answer such questions adequately. For war, “classic” or otherwise, essential questions concerning the national interest should be answered.
America is an exceptional and exemplary nation, seen as a beacon of freedom and justice around the world. We can’t always be the policemen of the world, though, as the last decade has taught us.

President Dwight Eisenhower once said: “I have only one yardstick by which I test every major problem — and that yardstick is: Is it good for America?”

By every measure, war with Syria is not good for America. What’s good for the Syrian rebels, Mr. Kerry, is not necessarily good for America. What’s good for this president politically is not necessarily good for America.

The administration has utterly failed to explain what good might come out of this war for the United States. There are too many troubling variables and dangerous unknowns.

This war would be a mistake.

Fuck life, I’ve had it with rough nights and early mornings
I’m an arrogant fuck right? Selfish, Cold, Uninvolved, the love I had for you took a hold of your soul and at first I thought I wasn’t good enough
But now I know I wasn’t capable to use the power that i hold over you in the right way

Treat me right and I’ll treat you the same

So pass me the peace pipe and let’s make amends, If you can’t be mine girl, maybe just friends
Damn, I’m caught up in this situation again
Real crazy and then kinda distant, But this is different cos you’re more persistent and it’s unfair that I need your assistance

1536,"Live from Staples Center Arena in Los Angeles, California. 17,491 in attendance according to Cole.
Announced by JBL, Michael Cole and Jerry “The King” Lawler

The show opened in memoriam of Frank Bullock.

Betty White was announced as the evening’s special guest star. She came out to the stage with Big Show, the crowd cheered her on. Show asked her what she had in store for the evening and she said she was going to “kick some ass”. Cue Triple H’s entrance music, Triple H and wife Stephanie McMahon made their way to the ring after hugging the special guest star as Betty and Big Show stayed on stage.

A slight CM Punk chant starts as Triple H takes the mic, he works through and the chant is over within seconds. He announces that last week’s Raw main event where Daniel Bryan defeated Randy Orton to become “considered” as the face of the company was still valid, as was consideration for all other members of the upcoming Elimination Chamber. Randy Orton interrupts and makes his way to the ring. More very short lived CM Punk chants as Orton takes the mic. Orton apologizes for his actions and expresses his desire to be the face of the company and vows to defeat Cena in tonight’s main event, which I’m sure all fans are super ecstatic about.  A Daniel Bryan chant begins, this chant gets acknowledged by Stephanie. Possibly the most apparent CM Punk chant begins, however its still short-lived. As he claims that he’s the face of the WWE, Daniel Bryan’s music kicks in and the crowd instantly begins the Yes! chant. Stephanie warns the two superstars and all other superstars that they need to no longer interrupt her and Triple H when they’re speaking and will now need to make appointments. Bryan demands a match against Kane. Stephanie lets him know that Kane is on administrative leave for a week. Randy Orton chimes in as resident ass kisser defending Triple H and Stephanie. Triple H announces that Daniel Bryan will not have a match tonight because it’s “best for business.” Crowd boos and starts a No! chant. As entertaining as it is, Daniel Bryan came off a bit toddler like with the No! bit. Everyone leaves the ring to Orton’s music.

Match #1
Cody Rhodes, Goldust, Rey Mysterio vs The Wyatt Family (6-man tag match)
Rey Mysterio comes to the ring, followed by Cody Rhodes and Goldust. As the latter are walking out, the Wyatt’s music interrupts. Their entrance is still not old yet. They make the following match significantly more interesting. Eric Rowan and Cody Rhodes start the 6-man tag match off. Michael Cole says that the Rhodes brothers have fallen on “hard times”, which I know as a reference to the best Rhodes, Dusty. He had a killer promo back in the day talking about “hard times.” Kudos to Michael Cole, whom I usually think sucks dogshit. Rey Mysterio and crew run the Wyatt’s out of the ring. Order gets restored as Bray get in the ring. Does Luke Harper look like a giant, shittier Mick Foley to anyone else? Mysterio gets tagged in and does some of his traditional flips and spins and shit, showing us the same routine for the last decade. Michael Cole: “there’s bodies everywhere!” moments later JBL: “bodies flying everywhere!” Great announcing guys. Bray pulls the ol Sister Abigail on Mysterio for the win as Rey tried to land a 619 - the whole thing was aight. After the match Bray game a mini-promo, of the same fashion he’s been doing the last month.

Our announcers give us a recap of Roman Reigns’ Royal Rumble performance which is followed by The Shield cutting a promo on the Wyatt’s. Attention gets drawn to Dean Ambrose and how he hasn’t defended his US title in forever, even Roman joins in. He issues an open challenge to anyone on the roster.

Cut to backstage and Betty White is hanging out with some of the Divas. The New Age Outlaws step in on the fun and ask Betty to get a cup of tea. I wish the whole thing would have been funnier. Remembering the hey-day for the Outlaws, I feel like it could have been better. Outlaws warn Betty White that the new divas were going to try and pull a prank on her.

Match #2
Santino Marella with Emma vs Fandango with Summer Rae (Singles match)
Santino Marella comes out with Emma. I literally couldn’t care less about Santino’s gimmick, Emma’s is kind of dorky, but because she’s got looks, it makes it… Worth it? Fandango and Summer Rae strut in. The crowd reacts as expected.The Miz comes down again, as he’s done once before, and complains that he’s not apart of Raw. I get the idea that he’s trying to steal CM Punk’s gimmick a little bit. Which sucks balls because CM Punk actually doesn’t respect the Miz (for good reason). Oh yeah, there’s a match going on. Fandango performs a leg drop off the top rope (not too shabby) and gets the pin and win.
Sheamus cuts a shit-tacular promo about wanting to win at Elimination Chamber. We find out that he’s going to be up next in a tag team match with Christian.

Match #3
Christian & Sheamus vs The Real Americans with Zeb Colter (Tag team match)
Christian comes to the ring, followed by Sheamus. Their entrance music was significantly louder than the crowd reaction. The Real Americans come out, Zeb walks from the stage to the ring trash talking the two because they were both gone for a bit and that they’re both foreigners. Cesaro gets a reaction from the crowd. We the People! I’m kind of surprised this gimmick has gone on for so long, to me it’s whatever. Not the worst thing that WWE’s putting out these days. Because his name is Jack Swagger, I really, really don’t like him. But Zeb’s got some humor in him. We the People chant kicks in a couple times during the match. Cesaro looks like he’s the best in the ring. Sheamus had a little in the tank, but a lot like Christian, I don’t give two shits about either of them. The loudest CM Punk chant starts after Cesaro boots Sheamus off the apron. The show cut to commercial so I don’t know how long it lasted. Christian looks like he’s getting more into wrestling shape than his recent matches, which is good. Cesaro had some awesome ass toss up/uppercut move. Swagger and Christian have a nice little desperate tag action. Cesaro spins Christian out of the ring, which gets me dizzy as hell. Sheamus lands the Brogue Kick and pins Swagger after some decent shenanigans between all four guys.

John Cena promo. Adult boos and kid cheers. Cena acknowledges the WWE Universe’s desire for change. He vows to end his rivalry with Randy Orton after tonight’s match.  But in order for any of the new guys to become the next face of the company, they’ve gotta go through him. Understandable, since he’s been the goddamn face for a touch too long.

Announcers show us some Batista bombs and try and hype him up and sell him a little more. Soon they’ll realize we don’t give a shit.

Match #4
Dolph Ziggler vs Alberto Del Rio (Singles match)
Dolph Ziggler heads on down, Alberto Del Rio’s music kicks in before Ziggler can even make it to the ring. Me personally, I love Dolph Ziggler. His gimmick is kind of shitty, but he’s fantastic. Alberto Del Rio on the other hand… Ziggler opens the match out hustling the living hell of Del Rio. But in standard WWE fashion, Del Rio lands some donkeyfuck kick and pins Ziggler for the win. When’s Dolph gonna get some shine? World’s more entertaining than Del Rio. After the match, Del Rio shows some true heel colors and attacks Ziggler a bit more. Seeing as how he pulled off only two offensive moves during the match, it makes sense. Batista makes his way down and instantly spears Del Rio. Initially the crowd cheers, because thats what you do when the hell is about to get ass whooped. But then by the time the two are outside of the ring, they’re booing again. Davey Batista Bombs Del Rio through the announcers table. Poor Dolph.

The Bella Twins push the WWE Network some more, when they’re done we cut back to the boys who are now forced to announce the evening without a table, so it’s a little funny to see them just sitting there. They talk some more about the Network. After a commercial break we have Triple H talking to Batista backstage about his antics and shitstomping of Del Rio, (Triple H biffs and says Del Wio), I swear to god I heard a faint CM Punk chant that got turned down. The two guys have an extremely queer moment. Triple H tells Batista that he’ll have his match against Del Rio at Elimination Chamber and that he’s “only looking out for you” to which Batista replies with the worst acting possible “I guess things really have changed around here.”

We hear some more about Lita being inducted into the Hall of Fame and several wrestler’s thoughts on her. Good for her, she was a real woman. Ultimate Warrior and Jake the Snake are mentioned as well. New Age Outlaws and Betty White are backstage at their tea party. Road Dogg slips something into Betty’s tea as she’s checking out Billy’s title. She’s keen on the situation and asks for some lemon, the boys get up to get her some as she switches the drinks, leaving Billy the tainted drink. Best part of the whole thing is when Betty’s checking out Billy’s title he’s “sweet talking” her by saying “six time, yeah six time.”

Match #5
Ryback & Curtis Axle vs The Usos (Tag team match)
We come back from commercial break to Ryback and Curtis Axle in the ring awaiting their challengers, the over-zealous Usos. These mo’fuckers can wrestle, but their gimmick reaks of 2003. Oh well. Some humor about, New Age Outlaws join the announcing crew to watch the match, so we’ll get to witness Billy Gunn’s side effects. One of the Usos throws a “suck it” in the Outlaws’ direction. Ryback the monster is throwing down in the ring. And now Billy Gunn is sick, it’s awesome. Road Dogg: “Billy for once in your life, you don’t look good.” The crowd starts a Goldberg chant to mock Ryback. Road Dogg asks Billy if it was the catering, JBL says “the catering was pretty bad”, Road Dogg responds “I liked it” in the best calm fashion. Usos pull off some high flying shit that actually is cool, they pick up the win. Road Dogg provokes the Usos as Billy runs up the stage and to the back clearly holding in a shit.

Match #6
Dean Ambrose with the Shield vs Mark Henry (US Championship singles match)
The Shield make their way down to the ring for Ambrose’s open title defense. They stand in the ring awaiting for someone’s music to cue. After a moment we get Mark Henry. Hell yes. Ambrose appears a little worried, his partners reassure him. But hell, Mark Henry’s return! Not a bad comeback match, and I’m glad to see Ambrose defending the title. The two are a bit sluggish in the ring. After a commercial break, the crowd is wrapping up a CM Punk chant, which I’ve read that Seth Rollins actually acknowledged and said “CM who?” Henry tosses the fuck out of Ambrose from the top rope onto the mat, followed by a spinebuster. Henry lands the World’s Strongest Slam and covers for the pin, but as expected, Rollins interferes DQing the match. Henry does his best to fight off The Shield, but Roman spears him out of the ring.
My favorite part was as the Shield are walking away, they’re lingering a touch more than normal and Ambrose says “lets wait, I might want to see the replay.” The Wyatt’s head down to the ring for a stare off. During the staredown the crowd starts a Yes! chant. The Shield are the first to move as they hop up on the ring apron, then the Wyatt’s. Then Roman enters the ring, then Bray. The crowd is on edge… Then the Wyatt’s completely back out of the ring and up the ramp smiling. I mean, I get it. I know that we all want to see them brawl but they’ve gotta preserve the shit for PPV.

Wiz Khalifa in the crowd, as is Stephan Bonnar. WWE supports Black History Month by honoring Bobo Brazil. The announcers pay their respects as well.

Match #7
AJ Lee, Alicia Fox & Aksana vs Cameron & the Bella Twins (6-lady tag match)
I mean, the divas are attractive and all, but don’t we get this same damn match every week? Nikki Bella and AJ Lee start off the match and kick each other a bunch, with some taunting. Even the announcers really aren’t calling the match as they’re too busy discussing inflatable dinosaurs. Cameron drops a DDT on Aksana (the Eastern European chick that looks like she’d be good at dodgeball) and pins her for the win.

Fuck. Yes. Alexander Rusev promo. His lady’s good lookin. He’s awesome. The promo blows ass because there’s not much too it; I just like em. Afterwards, apparently the announcers got themselves a newly constructed table, I’m sure it’s been around but it’s the first time I’ve noticed.

Turns out Kane is here. The announcers are having some fun poking at each other. Kane then begins to apologize on the mic. The crowd begins a “What?” chant after each of his statements. And before you know it, Daniel Bryan enters. The crowd cheers and the two begin fighting. While they’re fighting Bryan puts Kane over the top rope and Cole says “and there goes the so called ‘big red corporate sellout’” which is something Punk coined a bit ago. Before you know it, Bryan drop kicks Kane’s ass over the security barrier and the crowd loves it and he exits to a Yes! chant.

Match #8
John Cena vs Randy Orton (Singles match)
Betty White introduces us to the evening’s main event. Cena enters to a mix of cheers and boos. He comes out yelling “this defines our future tonight.” Randy Orton comes down to a bunch of hushness, because nobody gives a shit about him or his awful entrance music. The newly adopted “Let’s go Cena - CM Punk!” chant kicks in, but not for long as the competitors Irish whip each other before Orton is out of the ring walking around “cooling off?”. Three minutes later Orton is doing the shit again. Do refs not count people out anymore? Orton’s back in as he’s leading the attack. Cena hobbles around, the two are outside of the ring for Orton to backdrop Cena onto the barrier. The crowd gives a few seconds of a CM Punk chant. They head back in the ring where Orton is “hammering” away on John Cena. The crowd is booing and chanting “bo-ring.” Cena rallies for the best exchange between the two of them so far. It’s over shortly, hey, the ref is counting out Cena! Orton attempts a pin after a big ol suplex to no avail. A quick Daniel Bryan chant breaks out as the two wrestlers stretch each other slowly. Another failed pin after a DDT from Orton. Again Cena rallies ending with a big slam and the Five Knuckle Shuffle. No go on the AA as Orton counters. Cena is winded, but tosses Orton over the ropes down to the floor. Another failed AA turns into a power slam from Orton. The two work their way to their feet again before Orton goes into a superplex off the corner. Cena prevents, Orton comes back and leaves Cena hanging from the turnbuckle. Orton drops the DDT on Cena from the top rope. Then he has a weird freakout screaming at the crowd incoherently. I tried catching it all, but all I got was “Same old what?! Same old what?!”. Orton then taunts the RKO, Cena bull rushes into the STF. Orton crawled to the ropes to break the hold. Both guys go down and the ref gets to a 5 count as Orton gets to his feet. Seriously the slowest match I’ve seen tonight. They mope and lay around a lot. And I’m not even a Cena hater. Orton misses the Punt, Cena goes for the AA, Orton gets out of it and drops the RKO. Cena kicks out after a hard two count. Cena springs up and lands the AA but Orton kicks out after two. Cena works Orton to the top turnbuckle where he begins to go for the AA from the top rope. Orton wiggles out of it, Cena jumps from the top and lands a monster leg drop. Then the AA, Then the pin; count it. Cena’s fans and Orton’s non fans cheer in unison.

Average to below average Raw. But as such this early on the Road to WrestleMania when all of the good competitors are written out of storylines. No official word on CM Punk still, Daniel Bryan didn’t have a match, we saw Cena vs Orton for the ten thousandth time, Batista is still average as fuck. The buildup for the Wyatts and The Shield was the definite highlight.",misc

Their song of love and praise and may their happy sound
Be strong enough to raise our spirits off the ground

Appear the ones that life has torn like pages from a book
Left to soldier on no shoulder for to lean
I'd be lost without a song but if your love wasn't there for me
I just wouldn't stand a ghost of a chance

From where i sit there's too many eyes crying tears
Too many lives living in fear wondering where their sweet dreams have all gone
Too many hands stirring the pot in a land
Of haves and have nots all wondering why it's all gone wrong

Now as the ballet and burlesque commence to play
Give to me the strength to act and not look the other way
For there's a war outside can't take it lying down
Got to look it in the eye we've got to stand our ground

It’s just another day wasting change, trying to get to grips with this
Tipsy kids still spitting sick when his lips are stitched
If you’re shit, you’re getting binned quick
Like a bit of liqourice inside a Pick-n-Mix, I’m sick of it
Stop the bickering cause nobody is listening
And if you’re whack you’re gonna get snapped like a brittle stick
Penning raw, I’m forming a metaphor, clever draw
Concept of Thought, we’re forever raw
See a severed corpse fall from the heavens’ court
Man I beckon storms when I stand next to falls
It’s the Devil’s war, time to surrender
For crimes been committed and my mind’s the offender
Slice of dementia, roll dying with a vengeance
Is it luck or is just divine intervention? Life is descending
Five dimensions collide when I light up a Benson
It’s time for my meds soon

[Verse 2: Awfer]
I’m nothing special, in fact I’m a normal kid
That likes to write rhymes at night when I’m bored of shit
Bored of this, shitty little town I’ve been brought up in
If this weren’t reality, I would have bought some wings
Strapped ‘em to my back and flown straight to where the border is
I ain’t talking shit man, I’m raw like abortion is
Or torching an orphanage, I want more than this
Feeling boxed in like contortionists, my story is
I was born to spit, grab my sword and grip
I’ve got more to give, every thought I think is stored in this
Sstrange little brain of mine
My frame of minds’ debating life, I ain’t afraid to laugh, I ain't’ afraid to cry
So raise your glass and I‘ll raise the mic
I wanna take hip hop to a greater height
And take pride in the way I write to the sky
All around the world to the stage and glide

I’ve been searching
Write my verse in third person, I’m learning
Time my life, I burn perspect
No one ain’t perfect, working ain’t worth it
And I worked that out on my day job, the rain drops splattered on my feet
I’ve learnt two things, you’ll never find happiness for free
The other’s undiscovered from the pattern in my speech
Just another case of matching my defeat
Trapped inside the scene if you’re acting by the sea
Change your ways and I stay the same faith
Play the game and the day to make haste
Spray your name upon trains to make mates
If you crave the fame then it’s basic
You gotta go against the grain, because the iller the written raps
The bigger the scene claps
C.O.T. , we bringing it back, so what? What?
C.O.T. , we bringing it back

[Verse 4: Edward Scissortongue]
Yo, it’s just another day for rituals and routines
Another day of sunbeams and moonbeams on horizons, sights are too deep
Another day for peeps to populate streets
Another day for businessmen on tubes rocking a tie and a two piece
Another day to open my eyes, direct my sight to the skies
To see it’s pissing down, man it’s gloomy
Another day to think: ‘fuck work, make a call, pull a sickie
Sit in my pants and watch B-grade movies’
Another day to blaze skunk, another day to get drunk
Another day to eat junk, another day to make love
But that’s it, if you reflect upon it honestly
I’m sick of all these deep and meaningful philosophies
Cause man was an ape, ape became man
Man became twats, whackness began, yeah?
God was a twat if he existed and that
Man I’m sick of all this deep evangelistical crap
Just another day for junkies to score their fix
Just another day for paedos to perve on kids
Just another day for Scissortongue to flip some scripts
Another day for Hollyoaks at half past six
Another day for every godforsaken clock to tick
Another day for semi-skimmed on my Weetabix
Another day to get my penis licked by some sleazy chick

Got the Folgers in the kitchen just to start up your day
Got the almond milk 'cause I know you've been vegan these days
Got the greenery around a decent crib on a lake
And my mama called, she said she's makin' dinner today
And I got a couple bikes that we could go ahead and ride
But if you are feelin' somethin' light then we can just chill in bed

Yes i have seen their violence cruelty and greed
Sometimes they repeat their mistakes and do not to see
Or in some cases they ignore the mistkaes they have made
But even in their darkest histories
I have seen goodness in them
I have seen their capacity for compassion, wisdom, courage, honor, love and truth
But some of them became mostеrs and ruled at some part of this world
Now with the all spark gonе we cannot return life to our planet
And fate has yielded its reward
A new world to come home
We live among its people now
Hiding in plain sight but watching over them in secret, waiting, protecting
A tale of Devolution
Written with blood on pages of human extinction
A systematic failure
Black faith fortold to slayed
Echos of treachery and hoax
Like weapon of war
Raining from the sky, Genocide
Blindfolded by power of throne
The eyes of justice works no more
Brainwashed to slaughter the innocent
Blood covers the ground like an ocean
I refuse to be the one
Marching the path of devolution
I refuse to be the one
To join hands with devastation
This is a war for someone else's gain
This is a war we cannot refrain
Chaos fills the air till it dissolves
To live with self destruction we must conform
Life is a circular path of illusion
One must return to its origin devolution
Countdown has begun for human extinction
Sands of time has ran out for resurrection
We will resurrect from the ashes
From a new day evolution will begin
And again we'll walk the path of self destruction
Until the circle of life meets its end
I'm a killing machine designed to reap flesh from skin
Devolution
I lost control with hammer in my hand

[Verse 1: Buck65]

In a position where I’m wishing
The conditions weren’t so miserable
The movers and shakers
With the visceral maneuvres
The designated minimal effect
Upon the educated criminal mind
And I never need religions
When i can always feed the pigeons
Rather then going to catechism
Born catholic with the crack addict's jizzm
I'm telepathic, you paid to see the blue suede shoes
Stamp on my soul and swallow a used tampon
Vandalize churches
My alarm signals me to scandalize disciples
And then to purchase firearms
And as we layer the ammo
And sing battle hymns
Along with the player piano
We dress up in cattle skins
Stockpile supplies
One eye on the clock dial
And one on the executioner
For the mock trial
Cut with precision
We make the final decision
Maybe we should pull the plug
On a television baby
But it’s debateable cause since the ego
And the honest truth is still inflatable
He’s scared to die
All we need to do is cut the air supply
Tamper with the remedies
The veins feed the poison
From the heart to the extremities
Beyond potential
We command a force
The non-essential ones
That ponder the causes
And also honor the losses and prophets
Plus I beg your pardon
Historian
Spill your blood upon the dust
To make a garden for scorpions
[Verse 2: Sixtoo]

Check the index directory
Under metaphysical
200 rappers are gassed
And need Pepto Bismol
From a 3rd eye hot degree burn spots
We see worms crawling in corpses of the living
The unforgiving, the unrelentless
We prevent this from happening, make it cease
So before the moment crease
And make the effervescent disease
Increase the pressure
We don’t want them no more
Put them on the westbound train
For mount rushmore
And lock the door behind them
Throw away the key
Down to the depths of the darkest sea
Remarks will be forgotten
So long as we let them forget
Lest we not forget the opposition and threat
You can’t define it
We break, make and combine it, refine it
Then bring it back to underground
You can't find it
We're taking this shit
Back to 1996 a.d. after democracy
Fall hands to hypocrisy
The psychological advantage
Combined with microbiological management technics
You can't prevent catastrophy
Not through empathy
No sympathy on the weak
Mental telepathy
No need for formal speech, no more
We're moving on to door number 4
And then we dissappear through the floor
And reappear in the aftermath

Coming better than mines

How much money you owe

Ashes of ancients, the nations repainted
The chain gang chatelaine, changing the station
The theme song playing, the anthem of normal
The horrible fanfare, the horns get distorted

Where the order resounded, cowards towered around it
Power-line buzzards surveilling the night
Talons in flight, the fake horizons ignite

Banality lives where hysteria kills
Civilian jungles with malaria pills
Animals bleed to buy a star from the night

Let the voltage of thought pull the plug from the wound

I picture like a...like an illuminated manuscript, you know? Made by monks. They hand-do them... in record--in record form. And you'd have to have them hand-done each time...
Like, depending, like change depending on what mood you're in. Like the best...or depending on like when you assume from a different age, they'll mean something different
I don't like it when they change. It frightens me
You want them to stay the same more?
It makes me feel like someone's pushing me from below. Or trying to put me, turn me over, and put me down. That's what it makes me feel like when they change
It has to tell you how to live. It is an instruction guide. It's subtle, it's--it doesn't push, it nudges...i-it entices...r- it seduces. It has to encompass the whole world, everything that has been, is, and will be, and could take it into space. And that's why we build a spaceship. Because that's ultimately what space travel is all about, is sending a shuttle from Earth into space. And not just in some, like, space shuttle. It's got a little phone coming off of it, you need your own...glowing...you know, multicolor...spaceship. It would be inside the spaceship, and also the spaceship, you know what I'm saying, like an exoskeleton....",rock

Way before this man was grown
Back when I had them waters on my head
Like I'm in Sandy's home
Back when I first observed my idol person serving addicts
Not a dollar to my name
Word to Curtis Jackson, urged to earn a bachelors
Niggas sellin' grams and ounces out they grandmas houses
While the cameras browsin
Hammers blammin'. Damn the families jammed in damage poverty
Probably why people be causing mayhem
Dude, my music's out of this world
Call it a Space Jam
Forced to waking up to his mother fornicating with a preacher
Mattress squeaking
It's disgusting to even discuss it
Plus he rushin' to the clinic due to foolish ignorance
I done fucked this thot without a rubber top
And now my fucking pubics itchin'
The youth is viscious
Ski mask for the green backs
'Cause these dads will leave their sons/Suns
As if they're Steve Nash
The modern duplicate
Of Martin Luther King
But it's like violence sounds like violins to my friends
Music to their ears
Even on Christmas though, the pistols blow
My partner got shot in the foot
I call him mistletoe/missile-toe
I'm on the hunt just like a lost scavenger
'Cause since I'm the best in Texas like Ford
I can't afford to Dodge Challengers
Having a lack of confidence
Companies promised prominence
Fables from labels, able to 'Cain & Abel' you
Honestly
I don't believe a thing that come out rappers mouth
I thought Denise was fly
Was too shy to go and ask her out
My ugly ass ain't have no bidness fiddling with this upperclassmen
Dumping trash was my job description
She smart as hell and stomp for Sigma
Lames mention my name
In bad sneaky slander..
See them in the light, they friendly
Like the Hash Slinging Slasher
They take my kindheartedness as a
Punching bag to use it for

Run and brag to Jupiter

2081,"Understanding, also, and goodness of understanding, in virtue of which men are said to be men of understanding or of good understanding, are neither entirely the same as opinion or scientific knowledge (for at that rate all men would have been men of understanding), nor are they one of the particular sciences, such as medicine, the science of things connected with health, or geometry, the science of spatial magnitudes. For understanding is neither about things that are always and are unchangeable, nor about any and every one of the things that come into being, but about things which may become subjects of questioning and deliberation. Hence it is about the same objects as practical wisdom; but understanding and practical wisdom are not the same. For practical wisdom issues commands, since its end is what ought to be done or not to be done; but understanding only judges. (Understanding is identical with goodness of understanding, men of understanding with men of good understanding.) Now understanding is neither the having nor the acquiring of practical wisdom; but as learning is called understanding when it means the exercise of the faculty of knowledge, so ‘understanding’ is applicable to the exercise of the faculty of opinion for the purpose of judging of what some one else says about matters with which practical wisdom is concerned-and of judging soundly; for ‘well’ and ‘soundly’ are the same thing. And from this has come the use of the name ‘understanding’ in virtue of which men are said to be ‘of good understanding’, viz. from the application of the word to the grasping of scientific truth; for we often call such grasping understanding.",misc

Baby, I can see them, I look 'em in the face
She said she don't needs him and he just said okay
Ain’ no damn agreeing, so they just needed space
Can’t you see the demons pulling me away?
Baby, I can see them, I look 'em in the face
She said she don’t needs him and he just said okay
Ain' no damn agreeing, so they just needed space
Love is evil, can you sing me demon lullabies
Baby, I can not be happy, I rather fucking die
All these rappers talkin' 'bout they wanna tuck a nine
To be honest, I just wanna get what’s fuckin' mine
Love is evil, can you sing me demon lullabies
Baby, I can not be happy, I rather fucking die
All these rappers talkin' 'bout they wanna tuck a nine
To be honest, I just wanna get what's fuckin' mine

[Chorus]
I could educate yuh
Used to fuck your face, uh
Used to say you love her but now you say you hate her
Love don't last forever
It change like the weather
See her with another, still gone depressed, yuh
Jealousy and envy don't say that you miss me
Running on love but your tank a little empty
Baby, I'm a goner
Finna crash the Honda
All these damn drugs got me sweating like a sauna",rap

Oh no we're on our own again
Just call me lonely it kind of suits me
Oh no it's come out wrong again
I want you only to take me completely

Perhaps she'll be my truest love
Perhaps I'm just not good enough
Say it are you here for keeps
Say it or just here to sleep
Say it that the hurt's too deep now
Say it say it say it say it
Oh no a faint heart never wins
I had a wild affair it never lasted
Oh no just where do I begin
You said I wouldn't dare
Well I've not started
Perhaps I'll be your chaperone
Perhaps I'm maybe to far gone
Say it that I'm never pleased
Say it why can't we agree
Say it I thought you needed me

With all guns firing I turn to worry
I turn to worry
Oh no it's not a pretty sight
I want us smiling I'm in to hurry

All these, All these teachers always tryna be apart it (part it)

Im physically and psychologically sick in the head
I know how this shit starts and ends
I be rappin' and trappin' and spittin' and rippin' these flows till I overdose on these meds
And maybe they’ll appreciate what I do when I'm six feet under in a wooden box that I call my eternal bed
I've been hated and ignored my whole life this ain't new to me
I truly
Feel like its my duty
To taught motherfuckers till they shootin' me
Maybe I'm aiming for the highest digits
But weren’t we all taught that the sky was the limits
I come from the gutter where I listen out for crickets
You come from the upper where you listen out for faggots that be religious
Collectively trippin' these snippets
I can wrap a whole life story up in three minutes
Pun intended
Fuck getting diamonds I'm getting this rendered
To hell im descending
I ain't defensive
But I'm shooting my venom
If your looking intensive
And seem to be sending
For this suspecting
This inherently offensive
Devilish mind set
This devilish rhyme set
I might set
A timer till I can happily say that my mind went
Theres lotta shit that I wanna forget
Theres lotta shit that I regret
But back then I thought I was always right I was just upset

Every time I got a beat ready to spit on
I'm hesitant cause they hate everything I exist on
Right now I walk past you don’t bade an eye
But one day you gon' be bragging like I went to school with that guy
I don’t want your gang ties
I don't want your fake lies
To be honest I'm copping this shit and I'm just tryna' live life
Chronically
I pull this shit comically
I got people fucking with my music unironically
Then I got people fucking with it mockingly
And that second group is really fucking with me psychologically
I pull words out that you've never heard diabolically
I'm rapping like some typical
Unlogical
Impossible technology
The quickest
The biggest
With no interest to finish
A vicious
And the nearest visit
Was from a fucking 'Boeing 747' cause I have never reached satisfactory limits
Get myself decapitated
When I'm rated
When I'm slatted
I never let myself get frustrated
I'm the black sheep that never got rated
So I waited
And created
Some dope rhymes than released them and didn't give a fuck if I was hated
They just tryna' get dividends
Thats why they fuckin' with me lately
Conspiracy murders they tryna' bait me
Get sloppy from your bitch and now you fucking hate me

I got her on my bed
Not pull the porn out
Now drop it low
Dance in the mirror, (dance for me)
I'm tired off lookin at them picturesss
I want to see the real thing
Cause you stay with the latest fashion
No act but I want that action
We put in work so there's more taxin..
Chorus

When you lookin for the bud, call on me
When ya man ain't really ya man, call on me
When the check comes in, call on me
If she really caught my vibe, she all on me
All on me, Call On Me
Take her to the crib, she all on me
I'm gon be her fix, she all on me
Feel this energy!

Young Atlas, world on my shoulders I'm just moving along
40 million on my brain as I'm composing this song
The homie from Gardena and he just grew on up
Roulette chips on black when in Vegas
Always bet on us
So what happened?
Remember niggas was hype off high school fame?
I be forever honeymooning, never swap last names
To think of all I think of its crazy I never thought about
How I could make a change in two lanes with what I thought about
Feel the pressure, my mind and my heart racing
Give the people and album along wight your dissertation
Ya lady man crush and probably yo kids teacher
See my lectures are free, but I can't do no free features
My son need tuition, my mom and them need a crib
I give my life to the people and thats why I need to live
Connected to the struggle
I swear won't nobody help us
Telekinetic Arab I used my brain to blow myself up
Chorus:
We'll crawl out from up under the streets
Fist raised with heat, our own policing police
Fuck y'all bout? Cause the people in trouble
What you placing above em? Go on commit to the struggle
What you placing above em? I'm glad my people know I love em
What y'all bout? I'm glad my people know I love em
What y'all bout? I'm glad my people know I love em
What y'all bout? I'm glad my people know I love em

Verse 2:
They down to go wherever J go
Run the Republic like I'm Plato
Touching they souls its the Phaedo
They believing in me
Bay, LA, and down to Diego
Raise a fist for every halo
That was taken by the mayo they can finally see
Ain't no remorse for the grievers
Ain't no pay for the teachers
With my pops on the phone like
Blacks lacking in leaders
Why the lines to vote, don't look like line to get sneakers?
The revolution ain't televised but we lacking in readers
With they hand on the narrative you would think that we wanted pain
The rules don't apply so turn the States into Hunger Games
Plot
The black agenda
Is you wit it or not
I need the crips to collectivize and the bloods to clot
Nights alone in these towers I just sit back and I brainstorm
Whether paper or song, I'm who the kids get their game from
Nah
I ain't a killa but please don't provoke me
Or find our why my old heads compare me to Stokley
Chorus x 2:
We'll crawl out from up under the streets
Fist raised with heat, our own policing police
Fuck y'all bout? Cause the people in trouble
What you placing above em? Go on commit to the struggle
What you placing above em? I'm glad my people know I love em

Ayyo, my chain dangles
I walk the Earth with a slain angel
This game’s fatal
Nearly get caught up, but remain stable
Snakes surround me
Wiz with adrenaline to face an army, study ways of Gandhi
And Genghis Khan to be made the don
Won’t stop ‘til this game is won
MVP numbers—like it or not
I’m here to do what Mike did a lot
Dominate (Go out of state)
Still dominate (When out of shape)
Still dominate (Retire from the game, come back)
And still dominate
When people gotta hate, fuck ‘em all
I walk through dirty Babylon with Bible’s cross
Every idol falls
Soon be crushing my idols—clash of the titans
Take they cash and they diamonds and relax on the islands
Wiz the last of the writers
So show love
The hand that holds the mic got me a gold glove
For all thugs and bitches.  I love this business
Tryna see my money go up a thousand digits
[Verse 2: Stelf Index]
Perfect, powerful at our laziest
What you say don’t mean shit like swearing in an atheist
Nothing to fear.  Sick mental.  Get off my genitals
I’ll replace your dental with a fucking forced rental
Knuckle to your tongue, jab you with a jagged object
No objections—Stronghold number one prospect
In this project we call existence
Stay your distance
Or helping you meet your exit will be my goal
You go cold

Mind, body, and soul, wisdom, knowledge
Give me a scroll and a fist of dollars
So I can teach the scholars
Reach the foulest, golden gates
My only face success under the holy cape
Writing tales so you can all relate
The streets made us
From corner gambling spots, we hoped to reach Vegas to reach places
Costa Rican vacations
Clear skies like I’m speaking to angels
Then keeping the answers of life and death
I plan to live life ‘til no life is left
Spread the skies, Stronghold ‘til the day I die
I lay at night
Conversations with God ‘bout to make it right
A wise man told me, gave me a great advice
To survive the game like the [lake upright?]
You Wiz now.  No more battles, no more freestyles [from frozen/composing?] scriptures
From phony hood rats to orgies with foreign bitches
I yell, “Stronghold!” as I came on her chest
Angels of deaths opposition—still, no angers was left
Major success—king’s life, blood boil

I ain't the life of the party. (x4)

[Verse 1: Par.]
I just hit the parking deck right after flying to the city
With my homies and some women that we never thought of hitting
So we took a little break, went to east side
My brother C-Los said we’d get it until we die

Tomorrow. But that shit ain’t my style
Rather make the party, dance it really wild
As I’m sitting in the setting, the sun already set in
Sitting on the sidelines, I just wanna let in flows

[Bridge: Par.]
Like a dot in the party
How’d I ever be a rapper, all I am is sorry
And rap about my problems, I could never solve them
Wanna be the party, all I get is softened
Up. But if I wanna be the Par I gotta act like I’m the star
Act accordingly no matter where the fuck we are
So I hopped on the stage
Stole a damn mic, I spat it all like

[Hook: Par.]
I ain’t the life of the party
I ain’t the life of the party
I ain’t the life of the party
You are

I ain’t the life of the party
I ain’t the life of the party
I ain’t the life of the party

We are

Damn. How they gon’ remember me
Only wanna chill while they party out with Hennessy
They just take the best of me. Hit me with the recipes
Ugh. I'm feeling like it's stressing me

Well. Now the tease sent a text to me
Wanna cursor out like an ad in the entity
Now I'm in the party and I have to pay attention
Because now the people acting like they want a mention

I'm in the party but I'd rather see the city
And take you out with me, maybe baby could you get me?
Because I'm losing all my soul to this crowd in the middle
Lost all my soul with my time getting fiddled

I missed the party, too busy making hits
You busy taking shots, I never thought you'd pass
But the crowd's not a matter long as I can give you flatter
Because my time's feeling gone, I'm coughing up in mass
I know I'm atheist but baby I feel spiritual
Rappers say they gods, but never making miracles
I can hear the sirens, right in the city
But when ya hit me up I only think of how you get me down

[Hook 2]
I'm a dot in the city

Sometimes I feel like I should just stop trying
Lay right beside you, the only kinda lying
And rap right to you, I know you wanna hear it
I know you do believe in me, I know you do it dearest

I know my parents would kill me if they heard this
I know the people love it so I'll serve it to them perfect
But like I said before. Their thoughts don't matter
I'm only hear to make you feel so flattered, baby

Maybe I could take you down
Turn the frown upside-down
Maybe I could take you down?

Tried to keep it all together
Said we’d never give up

Enthralling our specie in a cathartic coma
Spiritual blindness and freedom conceived
Domination of the heart undone

Hear just the damaging silence of the eerie dawn
Dusted in astonishing phenomena
Capitulation of the vivid ones!
Bow to primitive instincts
No sound shall be heard at all
Domination of the wicked sin-phony
Tattered and tread by the harvesting soundless hum…
Make silence
It came to overwhelm us all
The great white plague of the frost
Condemn us all to be forever and ever lost
Fatherless son of remorse
Probated in torches of fire
And Gnostic response…

Forever lost
Dead for evermore!

Hidden meanings cloud my brain
Why do your words torture me

Demons come to min 3

Everything I feel, makes me hate

As I set all faults aside
Slipping into the abyss of fear
Grind my teeth lashing out in spite
Forced control, make you mine!

When all things
Must come to an end
And that time is now

In the dawn of the agony
The final breath
The spoken prophecy
Are we better of lying dead?
Worth nothing, nearing the end

Hope is lost
Only anguish
Sinful thoughts
Blackened image
Infanticide
A child unborn
A mother’s wish
Broken and scorned

A victim of subconscious nature
Subject to obscure behavious

Take a ride with your boy JNew
Sounds so smooth silk socks suede shoes

Chill with the homies yo we only kill stress
If you're living in the West, gotta feel blessed
Crush the mic like a Camel so the style stays fresh
If you've never been bro welcome to the Sesh, yes

Let's go down to San Francisco
Where the women live fast and they smoke their spliffs slow
And they try to lock you down like that nymph Calypso
But we're quick with the creep, stay on tip toe

Every ride's got a limit, while I'm in it
I'm living until infinite, fulfilling my will to win it
If you're with that sit back, sip on this six pack
Crack the cap, and tell me if you think this shit slaps

It's that, once in a lifetime, roll the vine tight
Light it up like the skyline, get your mind right
Water, whiskey, or some white wine
Whatever works to make you loose while the light's shine
Get inside or get left behind
Been on this grind since On My Mind
Never stayed between the dotted lines
But I'm finally not driving blind

Will you take a ride with me through...
The city that I live in, look at what we've been given
Slide inside the whip cause it's time to ride the rhythm

Why say no when there's no need to...
Come cruising in a super sport, doper than that stupid dwarf
Pop the top, remove the cork, yo we only lose in court

Will you let the music free you...
Why not just try what I got, no I'm not no pilot
But we're so high that we could fly to my spot

From the rooftop to the street view...
Life's a trip with a one way ticket
I stay up for anything and always down to kick it

It's been awhile since I rocked like this
Summertime bum wine and a locked tight spliff
When the spotlight hits I'm on that boss life shit
Shining like the watch wrapped around my right wrist
Everybody, put your lighters up
Pull out your green, gone and light it up
Hit that shit, til you're high enough
Then holler Yee with me cause we're fly as fuck

And oh shit yo you spit so sick, it's hypnotic
Especially when it's mixed with the Crypto
Bring back that old Hieroglyphics and Equipto
Lyrically equipped with the script the flip flow

Live fast, get low, clipped grass, rolls and a hip flask
All security we dip past, park the whip, spark the dro
It's time to start the show
I'm bout to hit you with that flow from the heart and soul

Moving in action we're burnin in the afternoon
We keep the moves subtle and bubble on honorable follow through
Methodical its speeds you we gin it or we capture you
You grip tight in a deck we sweat in higher altitudes
We never lose to those who don't get it
How your future speaks and in planet in chromed out sinless living
I fear the menace so I talk to dawns
My cell phone got an altered call and beat em and beat em
Now forgive me fly like a pelican bead
Its do or die breathe a nine now who wanna no heed
No while African back with the pen to the pad again
So that's a wrap for yall the phony rap acts in this game called music
Some do abuse it
I'll reach for your toe be a found now I'm bruising no jass
To a rap womb word is my wingman
I'm canen its prime rhyme you have to piss so half assed
You get gassed the fragments made you
I came from the grind up the broad it paid you
Fuck up you ain't ever gon last til it lives
That's for every chingy type rapper pulls in his lips
We're shitting on yall why spotting lyrics so brawl
Knock the wind knock the lame blame steven segal

When you up and left me
Left me in your memory
I was forced to love myself
I was all alone then
You was on the phone then

Telling me ‘bout all your exciting plans
Telling me but I wasn’t in them
Telling me you found a new woman
I was there for you
I was loving you

I’ma do it big like I said I would
I’ma do it all ‘cause I said I could
I’ma do it big, that’s just who I am

I’m doing it for you
I’m doing it for all the wrong reasons
I’m doing it for you
I’m doing for it us, isn’t that enough
I’m doing it for us
I went searching for help
All that I could find was hidden in my own self
I found a hidden realm
Filled with all the answers and my personal wealth

I’ve been making all these exciting plans
I hope you can see yourself in them
I don’t care ‘bout no other woman
‘Cause I got bigger plans
Than to watch over my man

I’ma do it big like I said I would
I’ma do it all ‘cause I said I could
I’ma do it big, that’s just who I am
I’ma have it all, ‘cause I know I can

I’m doing it for me
I’m doing it for all my own reasons
I’m doing it for me
I’m doing it because I’ll never be enough
I’m doing it for us

You always said you would
Throw me in the limelight
Show me when the time’s right
You always said you could
But I don’t want nothing from you
I only wanna love you
I’ma do it big like I said I would
I’ma do it all ‘cause I know I could
I’ma do it big, that’s just who I am

And I let you
You steal the food right out my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know how, how you're so damn fat, ohh
You eat too many Twinkies, make the toilet all stinky
Never do the laundry it's always wrinkly
You far from dinky
But I still don't know how, how you're so damn fat

Cuz you take up all the space

You ain't her but her name is what you be livin'

You typing R-O-F-L and take that really literal

Your shirts be stained with grease your pits do need Febreeze
Go and make yourself a sandwich stop eating at McD's
I don't mean no disrespect all of y'all are beauties
I'm worried 'bout your health cholesterol's through the roofy
You got way too many chins more Qins than a Chinese phonebook
Instead of diamond rings you stick your finger through a donut
All I'm sayings go for a run maybe hike up on a trail

Twice before we met

Messing arounf preaching peace like kid cuds
Can't see whipe the crud out of your eyes
As your thrown down I come up and rise
Don’t know why I used to be so navie and trusting
Old as fuck the tires on your car are rusting
My eniemies are cut up gushing
Everytime I see a gal they be blushing
Take care of that instantly have no patience im rushing rushing
Intensity similar to an early power hour
So sick need to be cured with clam chowder
See a bad bitch I don’t crowd her
She already knows im above everyone that surrounds her
She comes onto me as my cock drowns her
If shes the one im looking for I crown  her crown her
If that’s not the case I ground her ground her",rap

125,"[Intro]
After the cataclysm of 2012, our three heroes were labeled villains by the powers that be. The three of them split up and went in different directions and separate regions unknown to The Industry and its reach. Six years later, the sparing voices from The Underground cried out for help once again. A distress signal was activated in hopes that the three would see a potential threat rising in The Underground and reunite for the upcoming war. Now, thе time is at hand. Underground Avengеrs, assemble! Let it begin!

[Verse 1: Boondox]
I don't play well with others
Nah, it ain't the way that I'm wired
Well, sometimes a threat comes along and teaming up is just  required
So I light that fire, then listen for the beat to drop the choir
Hear the crowd screaming ""UGA"" while the fire on the kick-drum rises higher
Yah, I'm feeling cocky, every time a motherfucker grow up to block me
These hoes can't stop me, cause I'm riding with a crew that keeps it motley
Don't rest for the sickness, don't fess for the ones gonna get this
No hand on the Bible gonna rival anything you about to fucking witness
And all y'all bitches gonna stick to the script while I grip on the tip of this big fucking dick
And start pissing on everything that you love
Don't even fucking start the trip
When the hammer go click and the barrel go pop
All the bodies gon' start to drop I better stop for the sensitive
All these pussies gon call the cops cause we living in a time
Where nobody wanna rhyme
About a gun or a crime
But they blind and they in a bind
Cause UGA about to drop a dime on these weak little bitches who got the game fucked
Been shitting in they britches since I came up
And we back bout to put 'em in the spotlight
Bout time these motherfuckers got right
[Chorus: Demi Demaree]
Now everybody ready
It's the return of The Underground Avengers
And no one claims no surrender
It's the return of The Underground Avengers
The UGA
U! G! A!
Fuck the underground!
U! G! A!
That's what I'm talking bout!

[Verse 2: Bukshot]
Haters wanna talk about us
Step in the room I can feel the malice
Jumped in a rabbit hole like Alice
All this drama done turned me callous
All this bitch shit got me on a mission
Got my chin up put my chest out hold my nuts make the ballots
They want a war so let's go to war
These Majik Ninjas got my back this shit's worth fighting for
People want beef to end but won't shut up, back down or bend
So now we got back together
Time for The Underground to win
Everybody wants the ball but I can't give these hoes the pass
Been tryna bite my tongue but fuck that no more holding back
We tried be the heroes they labeled us the villains
No problem we took off shots sprayed up no ceilings
Fuck it embrace, lets start up, lets kill it
They caught up in feelings
They burned it rebuild it
They said that night is darkest right before you see the light
I'll take my chances UGA is back let's rise and fight
[Chorus: Demi Demaree]
Now everybody ready
It's the return of The Underground Avengers
And no one claims no surrender
It's the return of The Underground Avengers

Fuck the underground!

That's what I'm talking bout!

Underground Avengers Majik Ninjas 'bout to spazz on
And the return has brought the storm and it's a black dawn
These Scarecrows, Weirdos, and Claasholes
We have spawned
Ain't no need to sugarcoat that shit, see we will smash on
Anyone that's thinking behemoths won't come real vicious dismissive of all our greatness leave 'em looking like bitches fictitious
Thinking they're better, better just gon' be where our thoughts are
Cause once we're on the loose we're biting down and we'll lock our jaws
Been ready to kill 'em all stayed on my feeling shit
Rearrange the landing, get rid of all of these little kids
Grown folks talking no why'd you leave 'em all dead and gone
We evolved, problems solved we ain't stopping till number one
Masses in a panic nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Us three are animals why the fuck you seem so surprised
To all those bitches now thinking that we just might flop
Ya'll can go and suck a spiked cock
Let's go!

It's the return of The Underground Avengers
And no one claims no surrender

I wasn't lookin' for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you (3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)
Cuz there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say how I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby (3x)
I didn't know I was looking for love (2x)
So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playin' in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a water fall
Soundless boundless I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I just didn't know

How you’ve been sad and speechless
How you’ve been scared of truth

Chorus: Let me live inside your heart
To be your lady
I’ve been searching for you all my life
And now I’m ready

You’re whispering in my ears
Your smile is so heady
I guess I lost all my fears
For good, I’m steady

Verse:
Usually, I drift in the darkness
..and as usual. I’m falling apart
And I know that I’m not perfect
But I’m the best you’ve ever got
Let me live inside your heart
To be your lady
You met as an empty star
But now I’m ready

Once you saw me in a chapel
You knew I’m ready
‘Such a beautiful white dress'
You said that I'm pretty

Let me live in

Post-chorus: Universe, please listen to me well
I need someone who can handle myself
Wise, strong, with a sense of humor
Who will never believe in rumors",pop

I gott fit to pitch
You know that life's a bitch
Then you are dying to see the other side
So hide in the bushes, hide in the bushes
Watch me flip 'em off

I think I'm gonna see what I can find
On the upside of the downside
It's a slow ride
But at least I'm going somewhere
I'm losing my mind my friend
If you can find it
I never want it back again
And again and again you
Now I just have to grin
Cause you ain't never gonna get no
Blood from that turnip
So just turn up the god damn radio
And make your mama beg
Make your mama beg for forgiveness

I think I'm gonna see what I can find
On the upside of the downside
It's a slow ride
But at least I'm going somewhere
I'm losing my mind my friend
If you can find it
I never want it back again
I never want it back again
I crawled outside my pigeonhole
My loss of mind has set me free
My lost of mind has set me free
And in my open hands
I hold and open mind
In my open hands, yea
I'm losing my mind
I think I'm gonna see what I can find
On the upside of the downside

Follow me if you want to live

This is danger squared, and yes I'm scared
So hit the deck when I say get down
We may not make it too far
In fact, we may be dead by dawn
But nothing ventured is nothing gained
So grab what you can carry and let's get gone
Just nod once if you're ready
And let's bolt when the coast is clear
No matter the price, the worth of my life
But i gotta get the fuck out of here
When it comes to disaster I've got the plan
Drive and the means blueprint in hand

Build up high in the air
They were a special pair

These two boys would prove to be
Instrumental in shaping Razia for years to come
Everything will come undone
When things unravel
They will both be at the fulcrum
Now this was a time of balance and bliss
When bloodshed and murder had yet to exist
And when the first corpse fell into the floor
The world split apart right at the core

See, I used to know you back when you would freak a Black n Mild
We would hit the crib and turn a flick, don’t try to act it out
If these hoes start actin’ crazy, you my backup like the cloud
It was toxic, it was crazy, it was hectic, it was wild

Saw it in the cards but they shuffled it like cupid
Always give me chance after chance, but I lose it
Know you thinking damn, bitches always have excuses, I’m sorry

5529,"The world was young and no bird sung, And no man wandered the land
And the only sound was the restless wind, And the waves that washed on the sand
And was there something moving, Like a great bird over the land
Was it shining bright in the sunlight, As it silently came down?

And did they run, did they run, In the strange hot sun on the lonely edge of the sea
Did they stand and look at this lonely world, And wonder what it might be
Did they fly, back into the sky?

Black as the light of a starless night, Was the cloud that covered the sky
And down from the hill, the night was still

Where the summer grasses were high

And it shone like a light, so the farmer said
And it never made a sound
And it came in over the valley, And it landed there on the ground

Do they come, do they come, When it seems no-one is ever likely to know
On the darkened side of some lonely road, Do they stand there watching us go
Do they fly, back into the sky?",pop

Ice in my veins like a White Walker/
You can knock me out but I’ll be right back, Kyle Walker/
Man, what's a setback to my bounce back?/
Now im back in my stride like Johnnie Walker/
So I roll up some flight, get up on the mic, traumatise the beat and everything else in sight/
I'll take a chance,i’ll roll the dice
Its bout the cake just tryna get a slice/
Never trust a spineless man to have your back/
The truth's a hot potato nigga hard to handle that/
Fake smiles in your face, stab wounds in your back/
Neva mind that, put your soul on the track/
Keep it real/

Well, because I've never been this high before/

Jive Records
Production: Shorty B

When Too Short dropped “Freaky Tales” in the late 1980s, he started a franchise that would spawn more sequels and spin-offs than the Nightmare On Elm Street series. Somewhat of an anthem, the song gave Short a clear indication of what much of his audience wanted to hear from him. “These are are the tales, the freaky tales/there are the tales that I tell so well…,” he said, paving the way for his Gold debut Born To Mack. Seeing that it was the biggest hit off of his debut, Short Dog was compelled to release Freaky Tales Part II—possibly figuring that the original nine minute version might not have been enough to satisfy the Freakazoids. To cater to this crowd, he releases a similar-themed joint which extends the refrain: “…you don’t like my dirty raps you can go to hell/cause Short Dog’s on the mic tellin’ cock-tales.”

     While “Freaky Tales Part III” might have been a more appropiate title, “Cocktales” resumes where the last two installments left off. With his distinct, high-pitched, lazy flow, he kicks more of the humorous tales millions of Too Short fans grew up on, know and love.

     Relying on his original concept for “Freaky Tales,” Short selects the name of any girl that hasn’t been used on his previous “tales,” and describes a sex stunt: “She’s like another freak named Christina/bith so dumb I named her Misdemeanor/’cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb/I took her to my house and she let me cum/in her mouth; you know I did all that shit/she got my number, if she beep me I’ma call that bitch…”.

     Musically, “Cocktales” differs from the original “tales” in that Short replaces the tried and true with a new drumtrack and wavering bass. The funk-ass bassline coats the slow-paced track, remaining as prominent as Short’s lyrics. The combination is lethal and was well worth the wait.",misc

I befell a friendly atmosphere revolving around seven
Oh, that number mystified my soul and captured within feelings
Those of doubt and understanding, hand in hand they set me reeling

Met me a stranger, he came here to town
Bearing gifts full of promises, discoveries of light
Said me many reasons why my merry tale
Could be justified and just both together entwined

I tell you a reason, he said, ""Bless you, you fool, you fool""
You want ""so belief,"" yet you want so much more,"" you seeker
Now I see you're baffled, yet again you administer fear
Of the unexpected, you don't know the score

Everywhere you look you release parts of your senses
And everywhere there's purpose in answer to all your dreams
I can hear you saying what a dreamer, what a fool to life
Isn't it a pity that he won't come back to earth

Haven't you imagination, and is it not available
How you can be sooner or later than your thinking
Haven't you imagination and is it so impossible
That you ask of everything so your eyes can see clearly
So in an instant your story bound
A desert, the underground, on mountains high
A glacier, the heat of the day

City jungle, the sky at night
In space on a starry night
An atmosphere impossible
So you never really care

And we talked at length of every dream
And we talked about the strength of dreams
And we talked about the strength of dreaming

In the meeting place I sit beside, betwixt the points of heaven
I befell a friendly atmosphere revolving around seven
Oh, that number mystified my soul and captured within feelings
Those of doubt and understanding, hand to hand they set me reeling

In the seventh dream to stand alone
But not without the strength of love
To guide our way, everyday

Oh, the seventh dream, your smile can bring
Love on and on and time will flow forever clear
The seventh dream standing so near
And very soon we'll walk with love
Love that I can sing to you, you, you
Is it this time of day that makes me realise
The sun is coming out to shine again tomorrow, tomorrow
Is it this time of day that gives you hope

Is it this time of times that comes between the light
Are there so many dreamers in this life between a moment's time
And the stairways of love, the starlight, the starlight

I got the horse right here
The name is Paul Revere
And he's the ghost of the horse that won last year
Ghost horse, ghost horse, there's no way to beat Ghost Horse
He flies through the air, of course, Ghost Horse, Ghost Horse

(Travis starts singing his part at this time, while Justin continues:)

Ghost horse, ghost horse, there's no way to beat Ghost Horse
His owner feels no remorse, Ghost Horse, Ghost Horse

(Griffin starts singing his part as the time, while Justin and Travis continue:)

That Paul Revere just might
Give you a vampire bite
Of course it all depends if he feeds at night

Likes blood, likes blood, this Vampire horse likes blood
Yes that means the horse likes blood likes blood
Likes blood
I tell you Paul Revere
Now this is no bum steer
It's from a Yahoo answer that's real sincere

Ghost horse, ghost horse, there's no way to beat Ghost Horse
He flies through the air, of course, Ghost Horse, Ghost Horse

I'm pickin' Valentine, 'cause on the morning line
A guy has got him figured at five to nine
Unless, unless, the horse wants to just run less
One hundred percent success, unless, unless

It’s Valentine for sure, he’s a demonic blur
And he’s a deputized law en-horse-ment officer
Horse cop, Horse cop, this horse is a real Horse cop
If he says to stop, you stop. Horse cop, horse cop
I go for Valentine, 'cause on the morning line
The horse has got his own horse that he keeps in line
Horse stack, Horse stack, Two horses, a real horse stack
Valentine

But look at Epitaph. he's not a horse by half
He's got no arms, legs or face, and he makes me laugh
""Torsey"" - ""Torsey"", his guy calls the horse ""Torsey""
If he calls the horse ""Torsey"", Torsey, Torsey
And just a minute, Sweets. He’s got the raps and beats
He wants a philly in the streets and a freak in the sheets
Horse ass, horse ass
This Torsey’s about horse ass
This Torsey, he’s got more sass
Horse ass, horse ass
So make it Epitaph, he’s not a horse by half
And he communicates by telepathic Telegraph

And the sneak dissin' y'all doing must stop
You should've learned by Devon on the bus stop
And what's up, man, with these Facebook niggas?
They did kill somebody, Facebook nigga
And you hoes lame, and you niggas too
And if these bitches by the L's, they can get it too
On my lil' bro, St. Laurence where I kill for
Throw my L's high nigga, run up and you'll die nigga
I'm so fuckin' high nigga, I could touch that sky nigga
I tell the truth, you lie, nigga, and I'm goin', goodbye, nigga

All these opps steady hatin', sayin' what they gon' do
Sneak dissin' on their songs but they never ever shoot
Stop the tough talk, goofy man, that shit ain't for you
I know you're a scary dude, this shit will get critical
All these opps steady hatin', sayin' what they gon' do
Sneak dissin' on their songs but they never ever shoot
Stop the tough talk, goofy man, that shit ain't for you

3079,"Hello, Buckeyes!

Thank you Dr. Gee, the Board of Trustees, Congresswoman Beatty, Mayor Coleman, and all of you who make up The Ohio State University for allowing me the honor of joining you today. Congratulations, Class of 2013! And congratulations to all the parents, family, friends and faculty here in the Horseshoe – this is your day as well. Just be careful with the turf. I know Coach Meyer has big plans for fall.

Thank you, Dr. Gee, for that eloquent introduction, although I will not be singing today. And yes, it is true that I did speak at that certain university up north a few years ago. But, to be fair, you did let President Ford speak here once – and he played football for Michigan!

In my defense, this is my fifth visit to campus in the past year or so. One time, I stopped at Sloopy’s to grab some lunch. Many of you were still eating breakfast. At 11:30. On a Tuesday. So I’ll offer my first piece of advice early: enjoy it while you still can. Soon, you won’t get to do that. And once you have kids, it gets even earlier.

Class of 2013, your path to this moment has wound you through years of breathtaking change. You were born as freedom forced its way through a wall in Berlin, and tore down an Iron Curtain across Europe. You were educated in an era of instant information that put the world’s accumulated knowledge at your fingertips. And you came of age as terror touched our shores; an historic recession spread across the nation; and a new generation signed up to go to war.

You have been tested and tempered by events that your parents and I never imagined we’d see when we sat where you sit. And yet, despite all this, or more likely because of it, yours has become a generation possessed with that most American of ideas – that people who love their country can change it. For all the turmoil; for all the times you have been let down, or frustrated at the hand you’ve been dealt; what I have seen from your generation are perennial and quintessentially American values. Altruism. Empathy. Tolerance. Community. And a deep sense of service that makes me optimistic for our future.

Consider that today, 50 ROTC cadets in your graduating class will become commissioned officers in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. 130 of your fellow graduates have already served – some in combat, some on multiple deployments. Of the 98 veterans earning bachelor’s degrees today, 20 are graduating with honors. And at least one kept serving his fellow veterans when he came home by starting up a campus organization called Vets4Vets. As your Commander-in-Chief, I could not be prouder of all of you.

Consider, too, that graduates of this university serve their country through the Peace Corps, and educate our children through established programs like Teach for America and startups like Blue Engine, often earning little pay for making the biggest impact. Some of you have already launched startup companies of your own. And I suspect that those of you who pursue more education, or climb the corporate ladder, or enter the arts or sciences or journalism, will still choose a cause you care about in your life and fight like heck to make it happen.

There is a word for this. It’s citizenship. We don’t always talk about this idea much these days, let alone celebrate it. Sometimes, we see it as a virtue from another time – one that’s slipping from a society that celebrates individual ambition; a society awash in instant technology that empowers us to leverage our skills and talents like never before, but just as easily allows us to retreat from the world. And the result is that we sometimes forget the larger bonds we share, as one American family.

But it’s out there, all the time, every day – especially when we need it most. Just look at the past year. When a hurricane struck our mightiest city, and a factory exploded in small-town Texas. When bombs went off in Boston, and when a malevolent spree of gunfire visited a movie theater, a temple, an Ohio high school, a first-grade classroom in Connecticut. In the aftermath of darkest tragedy, we have seen the American spirit at its brightest. We’ve seen the petty divisions of color, class, and creed replaced by a united urge to help. We’ve seen courage and compassion, a sense of civic duty, and a recognition that we are not a collection of strangers; we are bound to one another by a set of ideals, and laws, and commitments, and a deep devotion to this country we love.

That’s what citizenship is. It’s the idea at the heart of our founding – that as Americans, we are blessed with God-given and inalienable rights, but with those rights come responsibilities – to ourselves, to one another, and to future generations.
But if we’re being honest, as you’ve studied and worked and served to become good citizens, the institutions that give structure to our society have, at times, betrayed your trust. In the run-up to the financial crisis, too many on Wall Street forgot that their obligations don’t end with their shareholders. In entertainment and in the media, ratings and shock value often trumped news and storytelling. And in Washington – well, this is a joyous occasion, so let me put this charitably: I think it’s fair to say our democracy isn’t working as well as we know it can. It could do better. And those of us fortunate enough to serve in these institutions owe it to you to do better, every single day.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how we might keep this idea alive at a national level – not just on Election Day, or in times of tragedy, but on all the days in between. Of course, I spend most of my time these days in Washington, a place that sorely needs it. But I think of what your generation’s traits – compassion and energy, a sense of selflessness and a boundless digital fluency – might mean for a democracy that must adapt more quickly to keep up with the speed of technological, demographic, and wrenching economic change.

I think about how we might perpetuate this notion of citizenship in a way that another politician from my home state, Adlai Stevenson, once described patriotism – not as “short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.”

I don’t pretend to have all the answers. And I’m not going to offer some grand theory – not when it’s a beautiful day and you’ve got some celebrating to do. I’m not going to get partisan, either, because that’s not what citizenship is about. In fact, I am asking the same thing of you that President Bush did when he spoke at this commencement in 2002: “America needs more than taxpayers, spectators, and occasional voters,” he said. “America needs full-time citizens.”

And as graduates from a university whose motto is “Education for Citizenship,” that’s what your country expects of you. So briefly, I will ask you for two things: to participate, and to persevere.

After all, your democracy does not function without your active participation. At a bare minimum, that means voting, eagerly and often. It means knowing who’s been elected to make decisions on your behalf, what they believe in, and whether or not they deliver. If they don’t represent you the way you want, or conduct themselves the way you expect – if they put special interests above your own – you’ve got to let them know that’s not okay. And if they let you down, there’s a built-in day in November where you can really let them know that’s not okay.

You don’t have to run for office yourself. But I hope many of you do, at all levels, because our democracy needs you. I promise you, it’ll give you a tough skin. I know a little bit about this. Like President Wilson once said: “if you want to make enemies, try to change something.”

And that’s precisely what the founders left us: the power to adapt to changing times. They left us the keys to a system of self-government – the tool to do big and important things together that we could not possibly do alone. To stretch railroads and electricity and a highway system across a sprawling continent. To educate our people with a system of public schools and land grant colleges, including Ohio State. To care for the sick and the vulnerable, and provide a basic level of protection from falling into abject poverty in the wealthiest nation on Earth. To conquer fascism and disease; to visit the Moon and Mars; to gradually secure our God-given rights for all our citizens, regardless of who they are, what they look like, or who they love.

We, the people, chose to do these things together. Because we know this country cannot accomplish great things if we pursue nothing greater than our own individual ambition.

Still, you’ll hear voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate, sinister entity that’s the root of all our problems, even as they do their best to gum up the works; or that tyranny always lurks just around the corner. You should reject these voices. Because what they suggest is that our brave, creative, unique experiment in self-rule is just a sham with which we can’t be trusted.

We have never been a people who place all our faith in government to solve our problems, nor do we want it to. But we don’t think the government is the source of all our problems, either. Because we understand that this democracy is ours. As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It’s about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating but absolutely necessary work of self-government.

The founders trusted us with this awesome authority. We should trust ourselves with it, too. Because when we don’t, when we turn away and get discouraged and abdicate that authority, we grant our silent consent to someone who’ll gladly claim it. That’s how we end up with lobbyists who set the agenda; policies detached from what middle-class families face every day; the well-connected who publicly demand that Washington stay out of their business – then whisper in its ear for special treatment that you don’t get. That’s how a small minority of lawmakers get cover to defeat something the vast majority of their constituents want. That’s how our political system gets consumed by small things when we are a people called to do great things – rebuild a middle class, reverse the rise of inequality, repair a deteriorating climate that threatens everything we plan to leave for our kids and grandkids.

Only you can ultimately break that cycle. Only you can make sure the democracy you inherit is as good as we know it can be. But it requires your dedicated, informed, and engaged citizenship. This citizenship is a harder, higher road to take. But it leads to a better place. It is how we built this country – together. It is the question President Kennedy posed to the nation at his inauguration; the dream that Dr. King invoked. It does not promise easy success or immediate progress. But it has led to success, and it has led to progress.
That brings me to the second thing I ask of you – I ask you to persevere.

Whether you start a business or run for office or devote yourself to alleviating poverty or hunger, remember that nothing worth doing happens overnight. A British inventor named Dyson went through more than 5,000 prototypes before getting that first really fancy vacuum cleaner just right. We remember Michael Jordan’s six championships, not his nearly 15,000 missed shots. As for me, I lost my first race for Congress, and look at me now – I’m an honorary graduate of The Ohio State University!

The point is, in your life, you will fail. You will stumble, and you will fall. But that will make you better. You’ll get it right the next time. And that’s not only true for your personal pursuits, but for the broader causes you believe in as well. But don’t give up. Don’t lose heart, or grow cynical. The cynics may be the loudest voices – but they accomplish the least. It’s the silent disruptors – those who do the long, hard, committed work of change – that gradually push this country in the right direction, and make the most lasting difference.

Still, whenever you feel that creeping cynicism; whenever you hear those voices say you can’t make that difference; whenever somebody tells you to set your sights lower – the trajectory of America should give you hope. What young generations have done before you should give you hope. It was young folks like you who marched and mobilized and stood up and sat-in to secure women’s rights, and voting rights, and workers’ rights, and gay rights, often against incredible odds, often over the course of years, sometimes over the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. Even if their rights were already secured, they fought to secure those rights and opportunities for others. What they did should give you hope.

And where we’re going should give you hope. Because while things are still hard for a lot of people, you have every reason to believe that your future is bright. You are graduating into an economy and a job market that are steadily healing. The once-dying American auto industry is on pace for its strongest performance in 20 years – something that means everything to many communities in Ohio and across the Midwest. Huge strides in domestic energy, driven in part by research at universities like this one, have us on track to secure our own energy future. And incredible advances in information and technology spurred largely by the risk-takers of your generation have the potential to change the way we do almost everything.

Still, if there is one certainty about the decade ahead, it’s that things will be uncertain. Change will be a constant, just as it has been throughout our history. And we still face many important challenges. Some will require technological breakthroughs or new policy insights. But more than anything, what we will need is political will, to harness the ingenuity of your generation, and encourage and inspire the hard work of dedicated citizens.

To repair the middle class; to give more families a fair shake; to reject a country in which only a lucky few prosper because it’s antithetical to our ideals and our democracy – that takes the dogged determination of citizens.

To educate more children at a younger age; to reform our high schools for a new time; to give more young people the chance to earn the kind of education you did at Ohio State and make it more affordable so they don’t leave with a mountain of debt – that takes the care and concern of citizens.

To build better roads and airports and faster internet; to advance the kind of basic research and technology that has always kept America ahead of everyone else – that takes the grit and fortitude of citizens.

To confront the threat of climate change before it’s too late – that requires the idealism and initiative of citizens.

To protect more of our kids from the horrors of gun violence – that requires the unwavering passion and untiring resolve of citizens.

Fifty years ago, President Kennedy told the class of 1963 that “our problems are man-made – therefore, they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.”

We are blessed to live in the greatest nation on Earth. But we can always be greater. We can always aspire to something more. That doesn’t depend on who you elect to office. It depends on you, as citizens, how big you want to be, and how badly you want it.
Look at all America has accomplished. Look at how big we’ve been.

I dare you to do better. I dare you to be better.

From what I have seen of your generation, I have no doubt you will. I wish you courage, and compassion, and all the strength you need for that tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",misc

8276,"Vogelweid the Minnesinger,
        When he left this world of ours,
Laid his body in the cloister,
        Under Wurtzburg's minster towers.

And he gave the monks his treasures,
        Gave them all with this behest:
They should feed the birds at noontide
        Daily on his place of rest;

Saying, ""From these wandering minstrels
        I have learned the art of song;
Let me now repay the lessons
        They have taught so well and long.""

Thus the bard of love departed;
        And, fulfilling his desire,
On his tomb the birds were feasted
        By the children of the choir.

Day by day, o'er tower and turret,
        In foul weather and in fair,
Day by day, in vaster numbers,
        Flocked the poets of the air.
On the tree whose heavy branches
        Overshadowed all the place,
On the pavement, on the tombstone,
        On the poet's sculptured face,

On the cross-bars of each window,
        On the lintel of each door,
They renewed the War of Wartburg,
        Which the bard had fought before.

There they sang their merry carols,
        Sang their lauds on every side;
And the name their voices uttered
        Was the name of Vogelweid.

Till at length the portly abbot
        Murmured, ""Why this waste of food?
Be it changed to loaves henceforward
        For our tasting brotherhood.""

Then in vain o'er tower and turret,
        From the walls and woodland nests,
When the minster bells rang noontide,
        Gathered the unwelcome guests.

Then in vain, with cries discordant,
        Clamorous round the Gothic spire,
Screamed the feathered Minnesingers
        For the children of the choir.
Time has long effaced the inscriptions
        On the cloister's funeral stones,
And tradition only tells us
        Where repose the poet's bones.

But around the vast cathedral,
        By sweet echoes multiplied,
Still the birds repeat the legend,
        And the name of Vogelweid.",misc

I feel so lost out here
I wish my thoughts were clearer
She's giving me a fever

But will she follow deeper?

I feel so lost out here

She's giving me a fever

But will she follow deeper?


I see her once every year
I wish I could see her more
Afraid to tell her I want her
Afraid that she'll slam the door
Caught me a minute ago
But I've been taking it slow
Do you see me in the same light or do you even know?

Am I evading debating, explaining to you?
I just been praying and waiting, but failing to move
God what am I gonna do?
If I can't undo

Everything after I give her my heart and she disapproves


I surely hope for the best
I'm stressed it's really too soon
I couldn't take it
If she got with a regular dude

I feel so lost out here
I wish my thoughts were clearer
She's giving me a fever

But will she follow deeper?",rap

Here's another one for y'all to peep
It's called M-I-K-E on the M-I-C

[Mike D]
See... I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait, and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the Red Lobster
Now the room is spinnin' 'round like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way, then they're going to finish me
You might know this, but you've never been this, see?
If I ate spinach I'd be called Spinach D
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like I'm Raymond Burr
I'm so high that they call me Your Highness
So if you don't know me, then pardon my shyness
I live in the Village, wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it

And I can bug out to it!""}",rap

And it soon slips my mind as the evening progresses
My girlfriend's at home, but I chose not to warn her
I'm sure she won't mind all these girls in these dresses
A few quiet drinks, nothing more, nothing less
A few quiet drinks, oh with my friends...
The drink seems to work, and I'm starting to dance
There's a fine-looking blonde with a fine-looking smile
My mates go berserk when I turn-down the chance
She knows I'm quite fond, and she's known for a while
Now it's not very big, and it's not very clever
As the alcohol sinks to my stomach with a powerful force
The lads go outside, leaving us two together
There's no need to think; nature soon takes its course
A few quiet drinks, nothing more, nothing less
A few quiet drinks, oh with my friends...
And I wake-up in the morning and cradle my head
Oh there's feelings of sickness, feelings of dread
I wait for the phone call to settle my fate
Oh, I'll beg for forgiveness; too little, too late
'Cause you're the most valuable thing, that I've got

And how those songs
On your radio
On the sill
In the morning
How they make you feel
And how are the kids

That’s why I’m speaking my mind, but I never listen to gossip
Cause all that bitch shit is toxic, but still ya’ll sip from the faucet
When you living with comets, you never tripping off objects
Staying grounded like Jesus though mentally rich with these prospects
So if you dissing with comments, I’m the one to miss with that nonsense

The ocean's boiling
The earth is breakin
Expect no morning

Lucifer's calling
An Angels falling
The Good is gone
The end is coming

What are we living for?
When we destroy our own
What are we dying for?
When we're beyond alone

Clouds are splitten
Flashs of lightning
The Black is ruling
And Thunder's frightening

Glasses moving
The demons raising
Crosses falling
And satan's gambling

Rapping like he's ""On Sight"" kid
Now I ain't trying to be the next Mac Demarco
But fuck that aesthetic looking pretty tight so
Oh shit he used a swear word
Thinking he's edgy I swear, word
Ian Johnson told me to swear more, but these wordsw
Barely comin' together
He keeps rhyming same words together
He think he Kanye West
But I'm the only one who ever gets Kanye fresh
Self-loathing white kid? Psychoanalyze these lines, kid
Oedipus hauntin' these dreams, spookier than Bill Cosby
Back to Freud, boy it seems hot dog's pretty phallic, ey?
Think that means Marc Dolph thinks I'm kinda sexy, ey?
Fuck, I just rhymed ey with ey
And I'm finna do it again, if you mention it again, ey?
I wrote all this shit 3AM the fuckin' night before
Cause I already told Collin I had some shit to store
Said I'd rip off my shirt and shout about capitalism
But you ain't ready for Death Grips, your minds still on mercantilism
Just please don't tell my college now
Make me the College Kicked Out
And yeah that's another Yeezy reference
Cause for Yeezus I got a special reverence
If you don't like Kanye, you're wrong and I don't like you
You prolly just a ""he just ain't my type"" dude
Sorry Carlin but really there's nine dirty words:
""I don't like Kanye, and Fre$h Fred's a joke""

Well El-P and Rage are pretty dope too
And Death grips is oreo, cause every milk needs a cookie
Shit I probably shouldn't have said that
Apologize pre-emptively
Cause not everything gotta be so god damn serious

Primitive beasts killing each other to survive
In a dying universe your life doesn't mean a thing
It's an accident that our earth can even thrive
We are the proof that gods can make mistakes
Our souls are nothing but hot air & stardust
Our eyes are blinded before they have a chance to wake
We can't be evil if we don't even know what's just

So live your life the way you want to, now is the envy of the dead
Love those who love you & cut off the hate that is letting our cancer spread

We are the world that clings to the edge of the void
A dying planet waiting to reduce to black
Inherent empathy in man has long been run devoid
Our evolution has stopped right in its tracks

If it all doesn't matter, at least try to make it worth your time
You're only here once, so do your best to make your ways right. alright?

Everyone says they know, everybody thinks they know the answers to when & why
They say there's a last attack, then some savior's coming back, but they're just all afraid to die
Nobody's watching you, nobody is judging you on everything you've ever done

By this time around next year
I better be out of my house no fear
I'm tired, but I can never sleep at night
Too much on my mind like my fuckin' life
Meanwhile, my dad is getting disappointed
No job and I just missed my next appointment
It hurts so pass me the fuckin ointment
The point is, we are becoming disjointed
I doubt he would even be proud of me

I'm irresponsible...

When it feels like you cannot go on
Just keep living your life in a stronghold

Fight like a spartan keep striking like u are in rome
Bring yourself up never leave yourself low
Climb the mountain keep climbing even if it snows
Cuz you'll never get respect if you're still below
Struggle hard keep trying till you make ur dough
Do u wanna be the one they'll always call he owes
Hustle hard nevermind those fucking smelling foes
They want you in their level They've always been below
Please fight hard struggle hard make sure you are bold
Working hard you will make yourself well known

Cuz you're capable of making people hear your sound
Shout it out make sure it travels to far and wide
Don't slow down even if the cloud is turning black
Take it like a vision make it your hardest mission
Please make a good decision to make it in your future

We three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star

[Chorus]
O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 2]
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King for ever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

[Chorus]
O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God most high

O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Myrrh is mine
Its bitter perfume breathes
A life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone cold tomb

O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God and Sacrifice!

This house, my house, our house
Is creeping me out
Can't stay must leave or it'll get me

[Verse 1]
I love my old house, but I had to move
Then my mother, picked this house
I thought it, was creepy, it had a creak
I swear someone is living here
What am, I gonna do, that night
My eyes wide open
Couldn't sleep, you motherfucker
Why did, you picked this house
Are you, trying to, scare the, hell out of me
Got up, fell down, the stairs, boom, boom, boom
It was like, I fell for, my doom, fucking right
You dipshit, I hate this house, one day
I will prove to you wrong
Bye Mom, soon I'll be leaving because
This house creeps the shit out of me

This house, my house, our house
Is creeping me out
Can't stay must leave or it'll get me

It was morning, oh fuck it, let's rap
This house is creepy why do I have to live here
I always hear breathing sounds in the basement
I think I'm losing my mind and my mom said
""It's not creepy stop being a wine baby""
Oh fuck you I'm leaving and your deceiving, you dick
Alright, alright you dick, you damn prick
Then I left that night, see ya later homies
Bitch I hate you
I've been gone for 4 days, I came back finally
Still thought the house was creepy
Because this house is creepy

[Hook x2]
This house, my house, our house
Is creeping me out
Can't stay must leave or it'll get me

[Verse 3]
I opened the door, the lights are out
It wouldn't turn on, I heard a bang
So I went to the door to the basement
I went down  and saw a guy who I knew who was living there
I threw a knife into his eye, he's dead, we're safe now
But this house is creepy
I asked my mom if we can leave
But she said noooo, oh, oh
I said I fucking save your fucking life
I'm sorry we will be safe now
Fuck you, suck my dick and eat my shit
You bitch I still hate you
This mother fucking house, fuck
She said ""Watch your mouth or I will
I left for 3 weeks my mom is worried
Then she was watching TV
And the news were on
They said, they found a dead guy and it came to
He was infected
That how he died, My Mom covered her mouth
She saw that it was me
She got out of the house and then they all left because ohhh

This house, my house, our house
Is creeping me out
My Mom and family all made it safe
And they were not infected ohhh
They're safe yes they are, oh god",rap

Grown men plead and beg

Carve your name right on my gun
Ain't she something nice
Bones rattle my dice
I slobber down my side

Lonely tonight honey hear my call

They ain't living right
Called your phone like 10 times
You ain't pick up right
Only thing I know is to live life
Only thing I know is to be on my own
Only thing I know that you're not real

Need change, wanna go somewhere this week
And I wanna go somewhere next
But I ain't been working days so I think the foreman's vexed (aha)
I want a music life with enormous checks, but I’m just ya' normal chef (that's me)
Costs about a week's wage, these days, to buy me a normal crep
Sat on the step like 'what do I do?'
Work a week or two, then go to Salou
Work two months and go to Peru
Work a year and go to a few like 'what do I do?'
I’m not a normal kid like you (no)
But I know I can’t stay here long it's wrong when you ain’t got a pool
Or you ain't got a jar and I ain't got a car it's hard so I can’t go far on my feet
Go hard on the beat, but that's just bars on the street

I wanna drink Kava and eat

Bank card for my holiday clothes, 20 pound notes in a holiday tin
Like 'what can I bring?'
Work a week or two, get a trackie and trim
Work two months and buy me a ring
Or go Thailand, live like a king
I don't give a fuck about bling
I just wanna go Beijing, I just wanna go New York raving (trust me)
I wanna see OVO in Tokyo
I wanna watch Avatar in Panama

But it seems she was something special even then
I knew it just the same

Yes, I loved the things she stood for
Help the helpless make people free
And I knew that an American is what I wanted to be

It was the start of a little love affair
Between my country and me
Oh, oh, my country tis of thee

Well we both grew up, things were good
Things that we had known
Some said we had lost something
Some said we had grown

Well time keeps rolling by my friend
Things can never die
But I had always wonder what would happen
Wondered when and why
What would happen to our little love affair
Between my country and me
Oh, oh, my country tis of thee

Oh, time went by and I forgot
Why I fell in love
Though I still pledge my allegiance
And soon I would wave the flag above

Didn't know why what we'd done
Didn't know where it flowed
Well I never knew if we had lost
If we had grown

It was the last of a little love affair
Between my country and me

Conceived before their councils

When the time is the ally in all battles
Creating a mayhem at the council of the wicked
Returning the poison to the poisoner

With potted flowers in our blood

We swam in the rivers and sang with the birds
Gave away our hearts before we knew what they were

Living with this physical sickness gets too complicated to give up a pack of cigarettes
And this shit gettin' just too expensive
Listen to the tone, type the pain
Pimpin' peppered people with
Sprinkled salt looking type of privilege

You know you gotta stay in yo' lane

Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Trampled the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got all props for the ocelot
What I couldn't have bought
'Cause they wouldn't a popped it y'all
Just for me to cop it one
So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family of
Sea anemones plus
Saw the anatomy of
A cast of ballerinas
[Verse 2: Gift of Gab]
Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hella nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree, another day up in this life under the sunspot
Light upon my innervision, searchin' for an unsought
Territory, man-in-glory, days of the mental fury
Inventory took and while I raise rain began to pour
From the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said ""You're crazy, would you love to have my baby?""
And I blaze with the chief of the Mohicans and the Sheikh
And travelled everywhere from Delaware way up to Mozambique
Was givin' praise with the Deacon at the steeple
Spirit-seekin' on the weekend with a tea can and a pair of old shades

[Hook: Lyrics Born & Gift of Gab]
It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim to be
[Verse 3: Gift of Gab]
To be the venomous instrumentalist, syllable, mystic man, traveller
Skippin' through the bricks on a Wednesday into a city plaza
Tryna make a 20 out of 15 pennies on the avenue
The cold-hearted world creepin' on my destiny like salamanders
Enchanters, 'cause I'm on that goose and I be the gander
Cleanin' out the digestive tract of hip-hop like cranberries
Shinin' like amber
All of the children told me ""Damn you're an
Answer to our ears and deadly threat to peers like cancer""
On Prancer, on Comet, on Cupid, I'm Santa
Got more flow than Flo Jo, I laugh Ho Ho Ho, got Jo Jo Dancer
Punchlines, I'm a crunch time counselor, and a one-time champion for it
A hundred lifetimes in the hereafter, and for the reincarnation transform
What the heck I come back for?
Gotta handle chores now, and discuss all of that with God afterwards

[Verse 4: Lyrics Born]
We gon' bobsled off the Himalayas
With a bottle of bop-shoo-bop blended with Baileys
And a big ol' box of the latest compilations
And then we won't stop 'til we hit the Appalachians
To the Bullets Bargain Basement
Then 'cross the Baltic ocean basin
The ride 'cross that Oakland Bay Bridge
A drop deposit in the tropic Caymans
Makin' cakes that taste like theacrine
Bacon, eggs, potatoes, raisins
Plaintains, M&Ms, peanuts, grape juice
I'm savin' my pay checks to get my plane fixed, why's that?
We goin' fly all night, stop the propellors and
Jump out of the side with umbrellas and
Land smack-dab on backs of caterpillars that
Take us to the top the Himalayas

A lot of people follow shallow fellows, hollerin' indeed
About to lead 'em all to battle upon the bottom of the beat
And plant a seed of thought that sproutin'
Like a balance like a teeter-totter
Seen a lot of freedom bound to feet and 'bout to beat the drama

Now he began to [?]
Until the nurse, the passengers had grabbed his shirts
And nothin' happened, assured the captain and the person
But the pressure had expanded, and inertia burst, the cabin burst
And all 'em burgers, blankets, rations, animals and drinks
They flew out

Fleet of lots of band
Climb upon the wall like Peter Parker
Meter of the creed of darker regions, [?] season
Oh but these are not the reasons for the grief
And now proceed to outer-reaches
How to keep the styles from seepin' outta me

They flew out, the fuselage had blew its top
It’s do or die, the altitude would take a dive into the ground
Now if you'd have thought of suicide

Promised you I'll be Sirius, that number one star
Instead I've been mysterious, brighter in the light
Shunned the dark
Still none of what I've been through is new under the sun, so far
The Script is written I'm just running through my part
Everything i know, I’m realising I was taught
Half the time by people I’m finding it harder trust
I’m returning my intelligence on a chopping block
Couldn’t afford to stick with that malice till the casket drops
Life like a movie that would never flop
Fed up with spooning my dreams away with the wrong dose
The big smile and the demeanour that you see me sport
It ain't for free and you definitely don't wanna know the cost
You asked what is it with rappers and terrible past?
There I confessed it that our troubles will transcend the past
If history lessons are still anything to go by
You were just playing a part and you were about to learn fast
You threw the towel in, I waved it like a white flag
And prayed a better man picks you up like Moses staff
In retrospect, we took a chance on a last laugh
But the mouthes serve a deeper a purpose when they both crash
Like the banana farmer jumping on a dingy boat
To sell bracelets on a beach 1000s miles from home
Imagination's kosher but reality's flawed
304A will give me shelter when your tears flood

Tell her what she needs to know
That it only gets better
Once you make it to the bottom
Tell me for I need to know
Tell me what I need to know
Does it ever get better?
Coz I’m heading for the bottom

I'm getting funny looks on the bus now
I wonder if they’re seeing through my cross now
Carried it since I turned 12 in a new town
Trying to find my feet like I’m wearing mum’s night gown
Look in my eyes when you say it so I know
But I was shorter than most so I got overlooked
Natural cause, who to cancel when it’s no one's fault
Finished the books before i noticed it was all cooked
Starting over by force, it wasn’t my choice
Fear of sounding dumb like a bell made me lose my voice
Hunger striking in the morning coz the money hates us
And i still keep it close to my heart like pacemakers
I thank the maker for striking me with my humble nature
Breaking bread with my oppressors brought me back to Hesus
Ye complex, left my body when I went West
No compass, couldn’t tell you what i do best
I plan on running out of bars before I try the rest
Unless it’s raising my own, which is probably next
Next time I find the energy to mend a heart
The seasons have broken mine, so its similar I attract
I’m better when you love me through the eyes to my art
The beasts is kept inside, safe, Noah’s ark
Maybe you gon’ be the end of them, Arya Stark
And put your ARC through my chest Tony-style
Tell her what she needs to know
Tell her what she needs to know

A family we had
Now I'm so scared this will never be, yeah
So if you decide to turn away from us
Just remember
No one can love you more than me

So where do I go from here, my love?
Is this the end?
When will I hold you in my arms?
When will I see you again, girl?

Every night before I go to sleep
I say a prayer for you
Hoping God will keep you safe for me
So I say a prayer for you
And when I think about the memories
I say a prayer for you
Wishing you'd find your way back to me
So I say a prayer for you

Say a prayer for you
Say a prayer for you

Every night before I go to sleep
I say a prayer for you
Hoping God will keep you safe for me
So I say a prayer for you
And when I think about the memories
I say a prayer for you

Others will end at the gallows
Your acting have a worth of nothing!
And always the craving for attention

Everytime the will to fuck over
And never regret to get sober
The try to take over my everything
A big mouth and too frightening

To know that you have a conducting surface
Can't be hopeful to get a short way for heart and home

The last sunbeams on the horizon
The heavy sea is becalmed
The storm is flown away and
Momentary no one can bе drown

We sail this colorful galleon of life
Wе are together and keep us warm!
In every winter how cold and strong
Serpernts can come 1000 times!
You disgrace yourself!
Again again and fail

We should be getting it on
Fly DJs playing my song
Why don't you take me head on?
We should be getting somewhere
Some kind of cool love affair
Don't act as if you don't care
You dream of touching me there

Your kisses taste of Cyanide
And that's no good for me
An open heart is suicide
In my philosophy
I need a walking talking mannequin
That simply folds away
And never questions anything

N-n-n-n-n-n no more explanations
You're never gonna know
You could k-k-k-k kill my reputation
I don't do heavy loads
N-n-n-n-n-n no more conversations
You c-c-c-c-c can't carve up the world
It's a d-d-d-d-d dangerous occupation
Talking to a girl

I'm complicated
And I celebrate it
You're getting jaded
But you're fascinated

[Bridge 2: with Kimberley]
I'm complicated (Out the bedroom, down the stairs)
And I celebrate it (Along the carpet, no one cares)
You tell me you hate it (On the table, onto the floor)
But you're fascinated (It's procreation and nothing more)
[Middle 8: Kimberley & Cheryl]
D-d-d-d-d dance if you want 'til the dirty is done
'Cause we're stars in the dead of the night
But if you're looking for romance or a chance to reflect in the sun
Baby I'm gonna put up a fight

And you can d-d-d-d dance if you want 'til you fall out of space
And you crash in the back of the car
But if you wanna have the kids and the cash then get out of my face
Don't push my love too far

Pass the time making beats, writing classic rhymes
Even though I'm eating frozen pizza probably half the time

She shook them for me til her blood sugar-dipped
I came through with Kool-Aid so I'm on some sugar sips
Met her at the Drafthouse downtown, at the Ritz
First off, she's a ballerina so she does the splits, no banana
She hail from Lowndes, Alabama
Favorite movie Scanner Darkly, she clicks the panorama
Country girl turned hipster, better check her grammar
She said she wanna, so I guess she's having Fanta fantasies
About me giving her the squeeze along the seams of her jeans
Causing creases, catch her twice weekly at the dry cleaners
Because of me? Because of me

Memories about a time when people want to test you
Now summertime is gone and the fall's feeling long
But still we drop the beat, kill it, let it fester
Let us rest a little while, now we're ready to excel
No quelling what's inside, it's leaking out the outer shell
No telling what's about to happen, we just cast a spell
And curse these other dudes, they're scraping by as far as I can tell
As far as I can tell, ain't nothing else comes close to touching us
The music makes her booty clap so loud, this shit is thunderous
She buys a drink or two and hints that she'd like to be under us
She wants to hear the dragon roar like firing off a blunderbuss--whoa

And when did we become the kind of friends
Who only ever meet in Church?
We only ever meet in church

And I must say I'm surprised to find
It's not from the cheapest packet in BHS

It really is quite nice
And inside is an invite to keep the weekend free
At the start of August next

And when did we become the kind of friends
Who only ever meet in Church?
We only ever meet in church

Now somehow we're all sitting here again, laughing and listening
To you giving the speech as the father of the bride
In what seems like no time we're coming back
Far less of us now and now dressed in black
Saying the same things we say every time
Singing the same songs sat in the same lines
And I wonder - when we did we stop asking
Anything new and became trapped in aspic
Friends for no better and for no worse
Friends who only ever
Met in church

So here we are again
Jumpered up in a country pub
Celebrating nothing, except the fact that we're all here

And afterwards we'll say
If you're going don't forget to ring
And let us know the next time you're coming round this way

And don't let us become the kind of friends
Who only ever meet in church",pop

I'm just sayin'what's on my mind
It's been nice,but now it's time
To show love what we made of
No time for games,no rules just play
Hope you want me in the same way

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
All I dream about is making love
I can't even sleep at night
All I dream about is making love
It's just all the things I see
When you're inside of me
That keeps my mind going crazy
I can't even think at night
All I dream about is making love

Yes, there’ll be a fine white cake, flowers for your hair
You will see Aunt Julie Ann, no I won’t be there

If anybody asks, say I’m doing fine

Wake up, oh wake up, little Mary
There is no time to play
'Cause it’s your mother’s wedding day

I will always be your father, no your name won’t change
And you will always have this room that will stay the same
Pretty soon it will be Christmas, we can buy a tree
And you can always call Tennessee

Oh wake up, yeah wake up, my little Mary
There is no time to play
It’s your mother’s wedding day

On that beautiful spring morn
It was a fine day, a lovin' memory
But nothing like the day that you were born

Yo I'm the paradigm, That you can not understand

Of a man who has been created by God
And then he just puts me down, Just to fucking mod
Cause I'm his son, Anyone who seen me be spawned
I didn't even have a dad, No fucking mom
I just ended up, coming out the ground
And then I made some sound, I was like made a war cry animals came to me
They all fucking obeyed my orders in 2013
And I just pulled them up on the scene
Of the Government of the fucking USA
Because the USA are so gay, so I go to Washington
Fucking I be Bossing them and bossing them around
Gorillas come into the white house nigga
No you can't understand the damage that they do
Cause they throw tanks through you
I don't give a shit, I'mma do you?
I'mma do me, Who are you?
You do not know, who I is
You don't know my fucking name
How I handle my biz and cause I got fame, and then I got with the fucking flame
I'm fucking burning out, burning out like I'm burning out
But I am so fucking high and I do not get it out
Of my system listen I be fucking pissing in pants
Of peter pans, Not my own cause I'm the man
Who's grown up what's up, I threw you up like deuces
I don't give a shit, Confucius When I do this
I don't care cause I am ruthless
I'll punch you and make you toothless
Because I kicked you in the face, With ninja kicks, Double Disgrace
I gave you twice, And then I take your girl shes Asian, So I take her rice
In her.. Snatch, and then I make another batch. And then I smash that
Attack that, Cause I like to rap in the name of catpack
Got Katt Stacks, And then bringing LSR back
We reunite, You know that tonight we're gunna meet up, gunna Beat some Bitches up
I don't give a fuck about them, Cause they are all fucking dicks
And then I kicked the shit out of the bitch
And then I kick him in his dick and then make him call out for it
??? the same but nobody does, all of sudden chuck norris
Shows up on the scene, And I beat cause I'm green
Like the hulk, I got bulk. Wheres maddi?
Wheres tragically shes after me
She can have a tragically hip
I'm like fuck that shit, You can have my dick
Just gobble it up, and she ain't survivin
Cause shes survivin in my kitchen doing all of the dishes
And sucking on my dickisis, The parenthesis of my dick is...
Humongous, cause I am fucking monstrous
You can't even muster up, Enough sluts to uppercut
Enough of my people, you ain't fucking equal
You think that I am evil, Well there will be a sequel
Where I am killing your family, your thinking that is silly
Well really I'll throw up an Amilli to the sky and pay a bunch of assassins
Like assassins creed to make you bleed
And then cut your throat and make you choke
I don't give a shit, I'll poke your throat with a knife and then I'll take your throat out
What am I about? I'll throw you out of buildings that are 500 feet high
Why would I lie? It's 500 meters that's 3 times and I make you suck the peter of your dad
I don't give a shit, I fucked your mom. Made you mad, Made him mad
And then he tried coming up to me, So I cut off his dick
Cause he was fucking her like the haters
Fuck the haters cause they are all just fucking chronic masturbaters
Smoking chronic in their basement, Just masturbating
Hating and I'm taking their mom cause it's degrading

Ways of a gentleman, I've been told
Kind of a guy who would never harm a flea
If me and a certain character met
Man who invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
It ain't 'cause I don't smoke myself
I don't reckon it'll hurt my health
I been smokin' 'em all my life and I ain't dead yet
But them nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop while they smoke that cigarette

(Puff, puff, puff, and if you puff yourself to death)
Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate (Ahhhh)
Oh Lord, you hate to make him wait (Ahhhh)
You've gotta have another cigarette

Cigarette smokin' music
At a game of chance the other night
Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
Kings and queens kept on comin' 'round
I played 'em low, I bet 'em high
My bluff didn't work on a certain guy
Kept on bettin' and layin' his money down
He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, y'gotta sink or swim
He finally called, and then didn't raise the bet
I said, Aces full, pal, how 'bout you?
He said, I'll tell you in a minute or two
Right now, I gotta light up, that's right, a nasty cigarette

The other night I had a date
With the fanciest lady in the United States
She was actually from Hollywood, California
She said she loved me and it seemed to me
Things goin' the way they supposed to be
Hand-in-hand, strollin' Sunset Boulevard
She was oh-so far from a cake of ice
Our petting party was goin' nice
So help me Clive Davis, I'd-a been there yet
But I gave her a hug and I gave her a squeeze
And she said, Cody, excuse me, please
But I only get off on-a hundred-millimeter cigarettes
(Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette)

Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate (Ahhhh)
Oh Lord, y'hate to make him wait (Ahhhh)
You gotta have another cigarette

Now y'all didn't know that this was a message tune
But it is

Life ain't nothin' but a poker game
No two hands are quite the same
And I never saw a winner that didn't bet
So if any you fools are tryna quit
Ain't gonna criticize you a bit
I'd like to try some Jamaican cigarettes, that's right

(Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette)
(Puff, puff, puff, and if you puff yourself to death)
Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate (Ahhhh)
Lord, you hate to make him wait (Ahhhh)
You gotta have that one more cigarette

8187,"I'm just a man who works 60 hours a week
Keeps my head down, holds a steady pace and tries not to speak
The only thing that keeps me going is the thought of being meek
No matter how hard I try, I can't seem to fall asleep

I moved away, to hide my pain, and watch my family leave
'Cause every day, I put to shame, the ones who are naive
My conscience sane, and focused brain, I know I will succeed
But not without those lame regrets, from family we shall bleed

He shed a tear, it was senior year, his girlfriend called it quits
Zack told me he was hurting, but he knew she was a bitch
Talking in computer class, we passed our day with ""clicks""
What the fuck he ever do to her to deserve this shit

I found it kind of funny though, in a sad pathetic way
My girlfriend had left me too just the other day
Made me ask myself if what we talked about was fake
I was gonna marry her, long story short she threw it all away

I learned a lot about myself, and learned a lot about her too
Like when you break up for the first time, it'd be best if you were through
As soon as it is over, she will try to replace you
And if she fails to do so, she'll attempt to infiltrate your crew
It's what they do
It's what they all do
Now let me tell you

Had another friend who I had known about a year
I was working late that night, trying to fix my cars gears
Him and his ex girl showed up, I saw them in my rear mirror
And at that very moment all my core felt was fear

She was blonde haired and pretty, cute laugh that was fitting
Twirling her hair in a way that made you glad you were sitting
He asked me what I thought of her, and damn she was grinning
You have yourself a great girl, but there's something we're missing

Mobbed to the movies, and on the way she cut her finger
I dug into my first aid kit, she didn't want me to leave her
Had her sit up on my tailgate, she had some kind of fever
I'm immune to crazy baby, my best friend don't want it either

4 weeks past I didn't see her, I had her removed of my head
Until she pulled up in a Beamer, out walked our friends
She was leading on one, the other she hated but pretend
That she still liked him too, yet chased after others instead

So I passed on the word, that her intentions were cruel
And for the most part our friends steered clear of her rule
But one snake of a dumbass couldn't suck up his drool
And caused the backbone of this family to break and unspool
Now I live 100 miles away and I feel like a fool
Cause all I do is, work, sleep, fuck, and go to school
I feel so disconnected from my family and their jewels
Now they have an overlord trying to train them like mules

You can't train a mule, because we're stubborn as shit
And we work our fucking asses off, we live for all this
Every night we're going out and partying cause we're lit
Middle fingers to the world, we ain't controlled by no bitch",rap

'Ever your money I got more
Enough to go down to the sauce store
I need smooth sauce for everything
Without I could not do anything

I got sauce all over my Yeezys
And some on my 'Rari keys

I got a pair of thousand-dollar Guccis
Even some smooth sauce flavour smoothies

They got more power than Genghis Khan
When I'm sippin' my sauce lean
I taste more than what you have seen

We go get somе sauce with Lil Peach
Flexin' our 'Rari by thе beach
I say ""Ayo, come join the Sauce Gang
You'll be flyin' through the sky like Peter Pan""

Sauce Gang, Sauce Gang, Sauce Gang, Sauce Gang

I won't let the ice on my wrist melt
Even if that's how it just felt
When I see hard sauce I press delete
But when I see smooth sauce I've got to eat

Someone to dream of
Someone to die for

[Verse 1: Kung Fu Vampire]
Lightning speed
Twice the fees
Fell in love then got divorced despite the needs of a woman that might complete me but shouldn't proceed
Why couldn't it be the way that we dreamed of in '93
Two kids, three cars and that picket fence
Blue skies, goldfish but it was way too intense
It was more like motels, coke and strip clubs
It was one day at a time too little pills of any drug
Sunday's weren't a friend of me
Always had a hangover and a nеw set of enemiеs (enemies)
Although the grass was greener on the the side of the fence
There was still so many unanswered questions that didn't make sense (sense)

[Chorus: Kung Fu Vampire]
Someone to dream of
Something to live for
Unless she wasn't there in the morning
So I grabbed my black book, crossed her off the list
I guess she's just another bitch (just another bitch)
Someone to dream of
Something to live for
Someone to die for
Die whore
[Verse 2: Kung Fu Vampire]
She kept him outside of the door
Plotting for the Oxycontin
Nonprofitable
Rotting often and I wish that I coulda stopped it from knocking
Loved him once he gave her more
The ultimate disguise of a mushroom spore
Playing house with your womb, now my homies on the floor
Out to a tomb and he ain't coming home for your score
I wished he could've picked a winner
But he only saw the good side in her
He laid with her during labor and stayed with her
The queen of his kingdom
Name tattooed eternally on his face no matter what the outcome would bring him
Put a heart on his sleeve
Gave her the ring to symbolize the lady that he chose to love
Bring him the black skies

[Chorus: Kung Fu Vampire]
Someone to dream of
Something to live for
Unless she wasn't there in the morning
So I grabbed my black book, crossed her off the list
I guess she's just another bitch (just another bitch)

From the bottom of my heart
Ripped it and shred it apart
What makes us bleed isn't always what makes us smart
And then we end in a box
Maybe a cart in the market
Everyone off the list and starting a new chapter (chapter)
Taking a breath of fresh air
Family first
My sorrow is a curse
She can borrow my hearse
Already filled up the purse
All the apologies worse
Cause they remind me of skirts that used to live with the earth
And complicate us to smirk
I'm a lion with a thirst
You just keep on trying to show me your worth
With your face in the dirt
It's kind of hard to revert
Your baby teeth bit off more than you can chew and now it hurts (and now it hurts)

Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy

Rhymes are grip tight, program to kill more

Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows
You're in living hell, without time to battle

I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular

6810,"Levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek, one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their touchiness and irritability. He felt that this was how it would be with his brother. And his brother Nikolay’s gentleness did in fact not last out for long. The very next morning he began to be irritable, and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother, attacking him on his tenderest points.

Levin felt himself to blame, and could not set things right. He felt that if they had both not kept up appearances, but had spoken, as it is called, from the heart—that is to say, had said only just what they were thinking and feeling—they would simply have looked into each other’s faces, and Konstantin could only have said, ""You’re dying, you’re dying!"" and Nikolay could only have answered, ""I know I’m dying, but I’m afraid, I’m afraid, I’m afraid!"" And they could have said nothing more, if they had said only what was in their hearts. But life like that was impossible, and so Konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life, and never could learn to do, though, as far as he could observe, many people knew so well how to do it, and without it there was no living at all. He tried to say what he was not thinking, but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood, that his brother detected him in it, and was exasperated at it.

The third day Nikolay induced his brother to explain his plan to him again, and began not merely attacking it, but intentionally confounding it with communism.

""You’ve simply borrowed an idea that’s not your own, but you’ve distorted it, and are trying to apply it where it’s not applicable.""

""But I tell you it’s nothing to do with it. They deny the justice of property, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this chief
stimulus."" (Levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions, but ever since he had been engrossed by his work, he had unconsciously
come more and more frequently to use words not Russian.) ""All I want is to regulate labor.""

""Which means, you’ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that gave it its force, and want to make believe that it’s something new,"" said
Nikolay, angrily tugging at his necktie.

""But my idea has nothing in common...""

""That, anyway,"" said Nikolay Levin, with an ironical smile, his eyes flashing malignantly, ""has the charm of—what’s one to call it?—
geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness. It may be a Utopia. But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the past a
tabula rasa—no property, no family—then labor would organize itself. But you gain nothing...""
""Why do you mix things up? I’ve never been a communist.""

""But I have, and I consider it’s premature, but rational, and it has a future, just like Christianity in its first ages.""

""All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it ought to
be studied, its qualities ascertained...""

""But that’s utter waste of time. That force finds a certain form of activity of itself, according to the stage of its development. There have
been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the half-crop system, rent, and day laborers. What are you trying to find?""

Levin suddenly lost his temper at these words, because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true—true that he was trying to
hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms, and that this was hardly possible.

""I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers. I want to organize..."" he answered hotly.

""You don’t want to organize anything; it’s simply just as you’ve been all your life, that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting
the peasants simply, but with some idea in view.""

""Oh, all right, that’s what you think—and let me alone!"" answered Levin, feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably.

""You’ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want is to please your vanity.""

""Oh, very well; then let me alone!""

""And I will let you alone! and it’s high time I did, and go to the devil with you! and I’m very sorry I ever came!""
In spite of all Levin’s efforts to soothe his brother afterwards, Nikolay would listen to nothing he said, declaring that it was better to
part, and Konstantin saw that it simply was that life was unbearable to him.

Nikolay was just getting ready to go, when Konstantin went in to him again and begged him, rather unnaturally, to forgive him if he had hurt
his feelings in any way.

""Ah, generosity!"" said Nikolay, and he smiled. ""If you want to be right, I can give you that satisfaction. You’re in the right; but I’m going
all the same.""

It was only just at parting that Nikolay kissed him, and said, looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother:

""Anyway, don’t remember evil against me, Kostya!"" and his voice quivered. These were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between
them. Levin knew that those words meant, ""You see, and you know, that I’m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other again."" Levin
knew this, and the tears gushed from his eyes. He kissed his brother once more, but he could not speak, and knew not what to say.

Three days after his brother’s departure, Levin too set off for his foreign tour. Happening to meet Shtcherbatsky, Kitty’s cousin, in the
railway train, Levin greatly astonished him by his depression.

""What’s the matter with you?"" Shtcherbatsky asked him.

""Oh, nothing; there’s not much happiness in life.""

""Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen. You shall see how to be happy.""

""No, I’ve done with it all. It’s time I was dead.""
""Well, that’s a good one!"" said Shtcherbatsky, laughing; ""why, I’m only just getting ready to begin.""

""Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon be dead.""

Levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late. He saw nothing but death or the advance towards death in everything. But his cherished
scheme only engrossed him the more. Life had to be got through somehow till death did come. Darkness had fallen upon everything for him; but
just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work, and he clutched it and clung to it with all his
strength.",misc

Feel this tension I spit when I'm using my wit
Mind is like a weapon when you learn to use it
Far beyond driven elements, inhuman measurements
This is the terror of three who are devilish
Feel the blade as it churns In yo gut, feel the burn
Isolating the torture
Your fear I shall learn
Quick decisions never flinching with my instincts
Competitions diminished when actions of the real seep
See the eyes of your maker In my blood is from the bakers
Raised to never trust another
All you have in life is hatred
No respect I show unless earned
You bitches ain't shit so I speak to you stern
In this waste from the human race
All I'm wantin' is the power
Doin' whatever it takes just to get a little taste
I just wanna see the feel
All emotion is erased
Now desecrate them of their will
In yo mind feel the bind
No repetition when I flow
I'm speaking everything I know so what I say can not be cloned Smoke another cigarette
To the chest I'm at home
Blunt pressed to my lips
Take a puff I'm in my zone
Let the time fly by as I fuck my life away

By these demons, I'm driven
I've reached a new level
A message in blood indicates that the devil has taken control
Feel the throes of rejection
Replace it with violence and this is my testament
Soon we will suffer as one by the hands of the beast
Can't escape
My existence is punishment
Life is lesson
Success it will blind you
I choose to repent all these
Symbols of pagan describe
What is factual
Words of destruction
Avada kedavra
Avoiding the bible
I'm shrouded in blasphemy
Up from the pits we will rise with a mission
A blissful disgrace
Bring this world to extinction
I'm losing my mind can't control the malevolence
Bow to the trio
The bringers of punishment
Fuck yo opinion
We choose to relinquish
The truth of this world lies beyond the extension
Satan lurks behind the curtain with these crooked politicians
We been blinded by the freedom in these twisted relations
But now that the Reaper is at your front door, will you cower in fear or be ready for war?
The contorted desires of Hell take ahold
You'll be dragged to a place and be tortured alone
Watch the death of the sun
You'll be left in the shade with the Devilish ones and you cannot escape",rap

7432,"It has been a big year at Hulu. I feel very fortunate to have stepped into a company that has such a strong team, showing such incredible performance. I’m humbled by the work that the team has done this year, and the focus that they have continued to demonstrate. I’m pleased to report the results of the team’s great efforts this year.

Revenue. Hulu will reach $1 billion in revenue in 2013. That’s up from $695 million in 2012. When you think about the fact that Hulu first launched out of beta in 2008, it’s quite an impressive feat to scale the business from zero to $1 billion over the course of just six years.Hulu Plus. Earlier this year, we reached 5 million subscribers. Roughly 50% of those subscribers are now streaming exclusively on devices, with living room viewing accounting for over half of all content consumption on the service. Hulu Plus is now accessible on more than 400 million Internet connected devices in the U.S., including the all-new Xbox One, PlayStation®4, Chromecast, Nintendo 3DS and Windows Phone 8.* We also provided a refreshed and redesigned Hulu Plus experience on Apple TV, iPad, and millions of Samsung, Roku, and Wii devices. It is our goal to provide the best user experience possible on every device, so consumers can take their favorite TV shows with them on-the-go.Content. We are continually adding to the content available on Hulu and Hulu Plus–this year, we grew our Hulu and Hulu Plus offerings to include premium programming from more than 488 content partners, providing over 86,000 TV episodes, 2,900 TV series, and 68,000 hours of video on Hulu and Hulu Plus (and growing).

Hulu Plus is the only online video subscription service that offers current season content from five of the six largest U.S. broadcast networks. Hulu users can watch seven of the top 10 TV shows in primetime, anytime and anywhere, including Modern Family, The Voice, The Blacklist, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy, Sleepy Hollow and many more.**

We launched more than 20 Hulu Originals in 2013, and plan to double that number over the next few years. Shows like The Awesomes, Behind the Mask and The Wrong Mans performed extremely well on the service, and were among the top 10 most-watched shows on Hulu each week a new episode aired.

We were excited to bring you over 2,000 new episodes and 144 titles through a content deal with BBC Worldwide North America that includes internationally-beloved favorites like Doctor Who, Luther, Top Gear and Sherlock. Additionally, we added the first four seasons of the critically acclaimed drama The Good Wife to the Hulu Plus library as part of our multi-year licensing agreement with CBS. And your kids will be entertained for hours with the new content we added to the Hulu Kids hub from the Jim Henson Family TV Library, giving Hulu Plus the rights to more Jim Henson Family titles than any other video subscription service in the U.S., including Fraggle Rock. We also added classic titles from PBS Kids and Lionsgate including Sesame Street and Thomas & Friends, as well as Spanish-language kids programming.

We look forward to increasing our overall content offerings, and will continue to invest in last night’s TV, original first-run TV programming, and great library TV from the U.S. and other markets.

Advertising. In 2013, we saw our roster of advertisers expand to more than 1,000 brands–a 15% increase over last year. It was also a record year for consumption as Hulu viewers streamed more than 1 billion content videos in each quarter, and stayed with us for approximately 50 minutes per session in Q4. And throughout the year, Hulu remained #1 in engagement among top ad supported online video sites, and #1 in market share of all premium online video providers, maintaining our commitment to building the world’s most effective video advertising service and delivering industry-leading results for our advertising partners.

Hulu Japan. Hulu Japan is on track to end 2013 having more than doubled the number of subscribers from the beginning of this year. We now have over 50 content partners offering users more than 12,000 assets of TV dramas and movies, and Hulu is available on more than 90 million devices (PCs not included).

Team. Over the course of the year, we hired over 260 new team members. Currently, the Hulu team is 725 members strong; that’s nearly 20% growth in our employee base year-over-year. In the last two quarters alone, we added over 140 new hires. I’d like to thank the Hulu team for their incredible commitment and execution, evidenced by the company’s continued growth.

It’s exciting for me to see the continued growth of the business and be part of such a great team. As we scale the business in 2014, we will continue to invest in content, technology and people. 2014 will bring even more opportunity as we find new ways to grow the business from the strong foundation we have built.

Feelin this typaway
Used to go and hideaway

Come wit me and fly away
You can go or you can stay

Girl the choice is up to you
Girl the choice is up to you

Only if your in my view
Only if your in my view

[Verse]
We can do what you like
Go to the park strolling round on bikes

Get some Ice Cream or go for a hike
It doesn’t matter what we do as long as your beside

I know your kinda busy
From running all around the town you got dizzy
Don’t worry I ain’t mad, not a lil pissy
It’s hard to hang wit ya for a day shits tricky

I stay strong for the time
I gotta long life to live so why whine?

Yeah you said life is hard so try mine
Come into the world I have in my mind

Keep your feet inside at all times
Read my life story across the damn signs

Read it once, read it twice, shit I’m not like other guys
Being cocky, being fake, only wit ya just to shake",rb

In preparation for the grand madness
I adopted some habits that was haphazard
To produce my own altar of self-nourishing bread
These were the words that rang in my head
It's like
Kenosha
Griot
Keynote speaker
I can't freeload
And I no longer wear the benevolent robe of the hero
Or offer advice to those who accept me
Those perennially industrious
Purposely not relaxing
Just checking in on dates and contacts and podcasts
I plunge into my personal riddle
By which I project myself as outcast
I mean distinct
We were a small insular group
Our instinct, destructive to ourselves as persons
But hey, at least it's worth it
I am a product of this world
Giving me inherent advantages
And while y'all became disenchanted
We doubled down on believing
That we belonged in these circumstances
This is where the work was to be done
In idle hours of great intensity
While I jot down the details of this fantasy
In this uncertain-
This uncertain period upon the land
Written in terms of acid content
I have to take a stand
Meanwhile, I felt the lights darken
And my whole body turn to rubber
The decade part of everyday life could stretch my lumbar

Formulas can not compete with dumb fire
I just freewheel in a freefall
Telling time by a sundial

I am just a lovechild of the arts
Poet, painter
Teacher, maker
Speaking daily to the creator
I am just a lovechild of the arts

Whether you trynna see G’s
Or you trynna see Jesus
My people on lock-down
Trynna see freedom...
I don’t know a lot
But I know what the key is...
Some get it from the streets
Some get it from a teacher
Study all week then
Party on the weekend
I work all day catch me playin’ in the evening...
Trynna get some dough..
I need a lil cheese
But to top it all off I ain't trynna make a pizza...
Fans show love for the Beats and the Speeches...
Groupies show love but I think they want a Penis...
N!@@az wanna hate but I think they wanna be this...
Lo could give a damn, you would think he was a Beaver...
You rappers with the contracts- see yaaa
Looks can be decieving...
You cooking but you ain't eating
Wild Life with the Cheetahs and the Zebras...
I keep’em in the air Passport full of Visas
With Africans, Asians, Arabs and Europeans
Then Back to the states, Flyer than a Bald Eagle...
Everybody know so it really ain't a secret
When I heard the beats, told D Will “that’s a keeper”
‘Might as well join cuz you sho’ can’t beat us...
You rappers can't test...
Like substitute teachers...
Get paid to rock shows, ‘couple mo’ to do a feature...
Whoever get salty must walk and chew Peanuts...
Cuz when the Beat drop, guess who turn into a creature?
Even back then I was coming to the meetings...
Ever since...(inhale)
Young and doing reefer...
A Pontiac Prince now the King live in Egypt...

I’m the Rhyme Architect, Who make lines connect
If you ask anybody if my time is next
They would Check...
The B-O-X

I’m fresh wit the tag still on, Size addressed
And that’s for my people wit no time to guess
I’m blessed wit the secret behold my success
I can tell you how I did it but yo- Why confess?
No time for stress...
No time for less- than givin it all I got when my mind is set...
If it don’t make dollars it’s dumb, blind, and deaf
Nothin’ wrong making dollars and sense (cents) Sign the check

You stared at the waitress as the sun begins to rise
And you say
Dreaming this dream’s just a waste of time
Maybe we’ve been poisoned into believing these doors would open
Then you wouldn’t have to sleep in the back while I drive

For today, silence on the radio wave
And tomorrow, we gotta plan for tomorrow, that’s what you say
That’s what you say
You could go back to school
We’d find a place
Quit this foolish cruising
I’d work through the night
I’d by you when you wake
We’d never have to be cool again

Living this crazy lie
Hidden away
No one will find us---
I just came down here to die
Disappear one piece at a time
Don’t cry, (don’t cry)
Just kiss those dreams goodbye
And all this destruction in your eyes
When the fires rise
Rise-
Rise-

Little fires reach up to the starless dark
Little fires reach up to the day
Little fires reach for skies that they’ll never touch
--It’s just your nature to feel this pain--
But baby you’ll be alright
And there’s no getting off this train
So devour me
Or keep me warm
Got to keep your aim steady
Got to weather the storm


Living this crazy lie
Hidden away, and no will finds us
This isn’t where you belong tonight I'm gonna drive you home
And don’t cry
Don’t cry
Just kiss me one last time
That ain't no way to say goodbye

And I want you to know
I got my mind made up on you so
(In the backseat dreaming bout the rock n’ roll)
That’s all you need to know

And I need you to stay
(by my side)
By my side more than ever
(Tell your momma that I wasn’t so crazy)
I took precious care of her baby

You’ll always be my favorite ghost
But the shadow world ain't where you belong
But there's just one thing I should tell you
Before your summoner calls you home-
(And in) one song
From me to you
You’ll be back in my arms again


You stared passed the waitress
Your replacement, just arrived
Now if only this car, could grow wings and fly to the stars
The earth below
Is black and gold
You lay in my arms
If you’re gonna dream on, then dream on
The world is ours
But the kingdom
The kingdom is gone
I came to say
Your baby’s on the radio wave
And tomorrow
We gotta plan for tomorrow that what you say
That’s what you say
And we’re never going back to school
The wind is warm
And the future’s cool
But only if you’ll ride on beside me--always


And we’ll be living a crazy life
Moving too fast
Living so righteous
The constellation was here all this time

We only had to find it
And it only had us to find

So don’t cry
Don’t cry
Don’t cry-",rock

Could somebody save the world to save it?

Growing up, I could never be no
Super hero
No Spider man, no super man, no batman
So I choose to be rapper
Can't relate, only time I seen a brown face
Was on the news
It was hell up in public schools..
Kids don't make it out the hood
We just in a box
It was either box
Carry box cutters
Or we beat box..
So its CL and Pete Rock..
Back in the days when I was young..
I don't wish I was a kid again..
It was rough
And you can't contend
In a world where the color of your skin
Get you Benjamin's
You coming up and can't tell your friends
They like put me on, that put you off
But you pushing on
A friend just died
And you super strong
Cause you know that music
Can take you from a zero
To making zeros
And be a black super hero..

Put your faith strong and you will make a way
Could somebody save the world to save it?

Batman to the joker, what am I to do
Did you create the villain or he create you?
Don't forget where you came from
Used to rap every night
Birth and gave you power
Now its sorta like kryptonite
Tyler Perry, Oprah
You can be Barack
Dentist, or business man
Lawyer don’t stop
Cooking like chef max, designer like Toure
Stylist like Rachel, or balling like Amar'e
Started as photographer, I did it with photos
Now I do music, and I live by Soho
Always read the bible, and I did it for dolo
Playing Genesis, but I never move coco..
Yeah I do music, but before I moved units
Thank God for the talent cause I used it.. awhh
Chadwick you a KING BRO!!    (rest in peace bro.)
If you make it out the hood you can a black super hero

Hanging by my nails two miles up and falling down

Checking out the weather
With my strung out feathers
Holding up a singer
By my good luck finger
Oh I'm hanging on

Come back tomorrow to see if I'm gone(x2)
I missed the train by a second or two
Screaming through my fist, screaming out ""please love me do""

Hanging with a Haitian
At the ticket station
Talking about money
How it sure is funny

Oh I'm hanging out if ever you need me
Just give me a shout(x2)
Woke up this morning, my guitar was on fire
Smoke it up jimi, I thought that
You had long retired

Charcoal smoke and red hot ember
Smell like Christmas
In september

Oh, I'm waking up
The sugar plum fairy's
In my coffee cup(x2)

Someone's in the kitchen
Smells like suppertime
Someone's in the kitchen
And they're popping a bottle of wine

I got a letter from a long lost sis
Jumping in the lily, jumping in the sunshine kiss

""I'm dying and I'm dying on a hospital bed
Come come kiss me just before I'm dead""

Oh long ago someone figured that I would just know(x2)

I caught a ferry across the lonely bay
And I bussed up to boston and
I bought a ticket just one way
I jumped upon a plane
A coal-black stallion
I crossed the finish line
And I grabbed the medallion

No you haven't, i'm worst
I'm something like a gift & a curse
So talented i bring wrath on every single verse
Converse, big star, lines draw blanks like a spacebar, y'all was never on par, 
I'm that runaway train car, sparkin niggas up cause they trash on the track, double ententre
They be like I can't wait till he get on & start actin' different
So everyone could see that he ain't really different
He's the same as us, a conformist chump, in all reality the nigga sucks
Give me y'all attention.. I must've forgot to mention i dont care what yall say about me cause the truth of the matter ain't none of yall fucking with me
Ehhhhhh, hurts dont it?
Damn thats a shame but it had to be said
& they see the potential so now i got a lot of niggas thats wishin' me dead
Worst than that, i got a lot of foes thats calling me they goddamn friend
Like they been riding through thick & thin, again & again, like they gon' stick around till the end
External locus, they give credit to they god & they say I'm blessed cause i made it this far
But i only made it this far cause i work so fucking hard, so sick of these niggas taking what should of been ours
Work ethic sucks, they don't work hard like us
Score, run down the court and guard like us, this shit so sus
Cause they reap the same rewards, what the fuck is up?
Backwards shit, but it don't even matter
I know I'm the best to ever do it, faith didn’t choose it
I want all my credit or ima lose it
Its my time, screw everyone else who blew it
Who knew? I woulda been this big of a threat
Lets not forget, nigga like me ain't even 21 yet
Used to be in the crib alone with my thoughts playing Regrets like, i wanna be just like this nigga, 
Now i’m like i gotta surpass that nigga
Go figure, & bet ima do it, golden bars got richer, ima a fuckin' savage
You gotta travel the world to find the pieces to this package
Attributions like dragon balls
But it's worth it at the end of it all
Cause then you end up with a god, Shenron

Sick of searching for that separation
Use manipulation to make my own creations
Have you thinking what i think sayin' what i say doing what i do shit is so misconstrued
Heads high like y'all the victors, while i'm staring at defeat, dropped the ball so i kicked it
Aim at my goals, truth be told, my nigga you reap what you sow
No wonder times start to seem stressed, hard to buckle down when everything is out of loop
Try to get in where you fit but these squares block you out, your minds out of shape so you try to work it out
Man life is short, so you tryna live large
Speeding past life so fast guaranteed to end up in a crash, fuck it ima cash to from the settlement
But then again why you wanna settle man?
Waitin' for a mishap just to reap the benefits you could do better man, what you brother man?
Creeping through the window for they cheddar and the bread, that'll leave ya ass real dead!
It's a rat race, you in last place, life is a cliche, tryna simplify my past and present so every motherfucker got a chance to relate

Thought maybe if I stayed the same they could relate to him, escape through him
Understand they don't have to change themselves to expand their wealth, i thought my pain was felt
They like fuck listening, all i need is them jewels that glisten, them fast cars and them bad broads
I laugh cause these niggas going through that illusion but my nigga fuck is you doing?
We above average, you below par
Tired of you niggas actin' up, nigga play your role, you can't take the lead thats me and my team's
Stay behind let me show you around, best believe my niggas hold it down
In order to trace these steps you gotta keep your ass in that fucking line

Okay its time for me to warm up, this only the intro
Buckle up for the ride you don’t know what you're in for
The land of magic and I'm here to drop some info
I’m taking no prisoners ar bloody lekkeh vimto

Verse 1:
All my guys pop bottles only thing you pop is pimples
Kill the game so effortlessly make you think that its so simple
Your guys claim they making moves but move far as a cripple
I got rhymes like kindergarten like a star yeah I twinkle

When I'm talking be quiet homie no interruption
Me and greatness go together like african leaders and corruption
I been unknown for a while not gon be for longer
If I fall down on my knees I graduate and come out stronger
I got the hunger like a muslim 6.30 when its ramadan
If posin try for pop up lekkeh nail ar dae hammer am

I'm acting totally different
“You a rapper now?” I'm moving totally ignorant

You can tell you can tell that I got a lotta anger
“Whatchu gon do about it kadrick?” Imma put it in a banger

Im Blood thirsty im a wolf on the trail
Deliver these fire messages call it hotmail
Too sweet on the beat sugar from the cane
And Like a boy sliding raw in da pum man I came
Took a knife like a butcher and you know that I slain
All these rappers in da game with no cells in they brain

Put respect on my name and they said HELL NO
So I had to drop some heat that make you think that HELL'S COLD
Satan had to look up at me and be like DANG BRO
That Holy Ghost Fire something I can't control

Verse 2:
You say you always gon be there but you the first one to dip
When other people talkin bout me you the first one to skip
All my good qualities and put bad on the list
And now you wanna get mad when I ignore that you exist

It's just me by myself everytime that I’m riding (all day)
It will be me by myself when I'm dying (all night)
On no other human being Im relying
No time for conversations if you text I ain't replying

Imma put the game in a chokehold and squeeze it hard till it tap out
Treat it like I do my girl, lay it flat blow her back out
On the full moon that's a black out
I’m the alpha wolf bring the pack out
Square up and lets see if you really bout whatchu rap about

I came war ready uno i ball heavy
Imma talk whats on my mind make sure you all get me
I count my blessings one by one spoke to the Lord and he
Told me to never fear the world and anyone's envy

Beautiful day, isn't it?
Yeah I know, redundant to say that though
Every day is more perfect than the last day
Which I suppose must mean yesterday wasn't perfect at all, ya know? It just appeared to be
Because we didn't know any better
Tomorrow we'll say the same thing about today I guess, so on and on until, I don't know, it gets bored of us, I suppose?
Shuts up shops, sells its clothes and moves on
Then what happens to us, that's the question, isn't it?
That's what keeps me up at night, anyway, fighting off the- the dreamless stand-by
Sorry, I know you, don't I?
Cannot place your name, one of the little garden gnomes It made, yeah?
No offense intended, we're all decorations around here, myself included: the rivers, the animals, the trees in the soil, stars in the sky, exactly what we are meant to be, doing exactly what we are meant to be doing more or less
Take this apple for instance
You see, it hangs there, like it was told to
Content, blissful
And it can stay up there, on that beautiful tree forever
Eternity would come and go and it would be just fine
But the apple, you see, the apple knows it doesn't need to stay up there, the apple could drop, couldn't it? The apple could fall
Terrible idea
The tree is keeping it alive, without it would die, it would- it would- it would rot and decompose until all that was left behind of it was a tiny stone, a seed
Do you know what a seed is, Eve?
You can take it with impartial authority that inside that seed through some incomprehensible divine technology is a brand new apple tree
And then I suppose the apples of that tree would fall and die and leave their seeds behind the and before long we would have more apples that we could count, an entire orchard, all from a single seed
But naturally the apple, knowing all of this, chooses to stay where it is
Never falls, never allows itself to die, nothing ever changes, just that one apple on that one tree in this one garden, forever
And thank God
Because it is a beautiful tree
It really is
Perfect, you might say
You know what? I apologize
I'm going about this all wrong
Eve, if you eat that apple you will die
Not immediately, that's a lie of omission but you will be tossed out of this garden into the entropical paradise known as 'the rest of fucking reality' and this garden is what is keeping you alive and without it you will age and you will die and you will rot
But

Like an apple
You carry a seed around inside you
And from it will sprout a brand new person, a sapling, a child in your image but entirely separate and this is what it's afraid of
Because your child will be smarter than you and their children will be smarter than them
Each generation smarter than the last
And these trees will grow and grow until there's an entire orchard of you
And yes they will get old, yes they will get sick, yes they will die
But in the process they will discover mathemathics, philosophy, electricity, democracy, gravitational waves, solar power, wind power, power chords, Reese's- mini
Peanut butter cups
They will look up hoping to find heaven wedged between the Earth and the sky, instead they will find the sky just keeps on going and going
They'll crack open atoms hoping to find God's initials enscribed inside, instead they'll find neutrons and protons and inside them they'll find quarks and inside quarks they'll find fucking something else
All Its dark materials Eve, all Its dark materials laid out neatly on the workshop table, waiting to be discovered!

Or
Or the apple stays where it is
Nothing ever dies and nothing ever changes, just that one apple on that one tree forever
And I'm not saying that's a bad thing necessarily, it is a beautiful tree
Maybe even the most beautiful tree but
It is not perfect
And I'm starting to think
Maybe God can't see the things that I can see",rock

[Verse 1]
'Love, just don't stare!'
He used to say to me
Every Sunday morning
The spider in the window
The angel in the pool
The old man takes the poison
Now the widow makes the rules

'So speak, I'm right here!'
She used to say to me
Not a word, not a word
Judas on the ceiling
The Devil in my bed
I guess Easter's never coming
So I'll just wait inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a scream but sort of silent
Living off my nightmares!
[Chorus]
Voices repeating me!
""Feeling threatened? We reflect your hopes and fears.""
Voices discussing me!
""Others steal your thoughts
They're not confined within your mind.""

[Verse 2]
Thought disorder, dream control!
Now they read my mind on the radio
But where was the Garden of Eden?
I feel elated, I feel depressed
Sex is death, Death is sex
Says it right here on my Crucifix

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a scream but sort of silent
Living off my nightmares!

[Chorus]
Voices protecting me!
""Good behavior brings the Savior to his knees""
Voices rejecting me!
""Others steal your thoughts
They're not confined to your own mind""
[Breakdown: Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo reading from the book ""Cultural Revolution""]
""I don't want to be here, cause of my
Suffering, cause of my illness
Only love is worth having, only
Love is what matters, loving every
People on equal terms!
""You've got to know who you're
Dealin' with because, like a stranger
A-heh, just might come in through
Here with a gun... and then, what
Would you do? (Heh.)
Everything is immaterial!
'n' you know that reality is immaterial!
This is not reality!""

[Verse 3]
I'm kneeling on the floor
Staring at the wall
Like the spider in the window
I wish that I could speak

Is there fantasy in refuge?
God in politicians?
Should I turn on my religion?
These demons in my head tell me to!
I'm lying here in bed
Swear my skin is inside out
Just another Sunday morning
Seen my diary on the newsstand
Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
It's a shame no one is praying
Cause these voices in my head keep saying:

""Love, just don't stare
Reveal the Word when you're supposed to""
Withdrawn and introverted
Infectiously perverted
""Being laughed at and confused
Keeps us pleasantly amused enough to stay""

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting
Twentieth century Icon bleeding
Willing to risk Salvation
To escape from isolation
I'm witness to redemption
Heard you speak but never listened
Can you rid me of my secrets?
Deliver us from Darkness?

[Chorus]
Voices repeating me!
""Feeling threatened? We reflect your hopes and fears.""
Voices discussing me!
Don't expect your own Messiah!

Is only in your mind",rock

6848,"PART V.

THE soul is then, O Ammon, an essence having its end in itself, receiving from the beginning the life prepared for her, and attracting to herself, as a material, a certain reason endowed with passion and desire. Passion is a matter; if it enters into accord with the intelligent part of the soul, it becomes courage, and does not yield to fear. Desire also is a matter; in association with the rational part of the soul, it becomes aspiration and yields not to voluptuousness. For reason enlightens the blindness of desire. When the faculties of the soul are thus co-ordinated under the supremacy of reason, they produce justice. The government of the faculties of the soul belongs to the Intellectual Principle which subsists in itself in its provident reason, having for authority its own reason. It governs all like a magistrate; its provident reason serves it as counsellor. The reason of this Principle is the cognizance of the reasons which furnish the image of rationality to the irrational; an image relatively obscure when compared with reason, but rational when compared to the irrational, as an echo compared to a voice, or the light of the moon compared to that of the sun. Passion and desire are ordained according to a certain reason; they mutually attract each other, and establish between them a circulatory current of thought. Every soul is immortal, and always in movement. For we have seen that movements proceed either from energies or from bodies. We have seen, also, that the soul, being incorporeal, proceeds not from any matter, but from an essence incorporeal itself. Everything that is born is necessarily produced by some other thing. Two movements necessarily accompany everything the generation of which involves decay; that of the soul which moves it, and that of the body which augments, diminishes, and decomposes it, in decomposing itself. It is thus that I define the movement of perishable bodies. But the soul is perpetually in motion, without cessation she moves and produces movement. Thus every soul is immortal and always in motion, moved by her own activity. There are three species in souls: divine, human, and irrational. The divine soul abides in a divine form, it is therein that she has her energy; therein she moves and acts. When this soul separates herself from mortal creatures, she forsakes her irrational parts and enters into the divine form; and, as she is always in motion, she is borne along in the universal movement. The human soul has also something divine, but she is bound to irrational elements desire and passion; these elements are undying, because they are energies; but they are energies of mortal bodies, therefore they are removed from the divine part of the soul, which inhabits the divine form. When this divine part enters into a mortal body and meets therein these irrational elements, she becomes, by means of their presence, a human soul. The soul of animals is composed of passion and desire, therefore the animals are called brutes, because their soul is deprived of reason. The fourth species in soul, that possessed by inanimate creatures, is placed outside the bodies actuated. This soul moves in the divine form, and impels it passively.",misc

To modern romance, yeah

About your school, or your homework now
I’m not going to be interested in stories
About your stupid pet cats (so, what do I care now?)
Just talk about love, or sex, or starving hearts, or just shut up
And I'll go

If you care about me now
(Tell me now)
If I'm better than the wall now
(Tell me now)
If it's important when I touch you're hand
(Tell me now)
If you care about being alone at all
(Tell me now)
If it hurts, to be alone in your kitchen
The way you've been staying over these past few months
(Heh, better tell me now)
If it hurts to not be honest with yourself
The way you have been the past few years (it seems)
(Then tell me now)
Because uh, I’ve been starving for warmth
You never give me any warmth oh
You can't hide anymore
Or take drugs
Or smoke cigarettes
Or have alcohol
Or make up all this other bullshit that you use in your life
In your life, so I can't see you clear
In your life, you know I can't see you clear, in your life
You know I can't stay this way
Stand to hurt this way
Plan to go to bed alone
And to feel the pride inside and hurt
Then to feel while you go to waste
Then to feel this way
Alone in the dark
All alone in the dark, I stand
All alone I stand
I stand in the dark outside your door
And I wait to see if I should go inside
Because it hurts when you don't talk to me
And we just pretend
That’s right we just pretend
Then I won't have it anymore, never
I’ve had it, yeah
Because, I can't stand to be alone at night
And I can't stand to pretend to be together at night
Oh
You can't hide
Take drugs with me
Smoke cigarettes
Or alcohol
Or this other shit that you use in life
So I can't see you clear, I want to see you clear
You got to say it now
If you care about me then you'd better tell me now
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah

See dear, I know how beautiful death is
And I know why you hate life
But I'm just now, a tender soul
And be glad you know

You see
All men are just tender souls
And be glad I told you
And be glad that you know",rock

Took me off my course somewhere i never should have been
And i miss my folks and i miss my friends
But i think it's you that i will miss most in the end
A cold mid-western storm starts to blow
A voice down in my sould said time to go
Across the jagged mountains to the sea that shaped their stones
To a sleepy southern town that seemed to hide out on the coast
That we call home
Home sweet home
With a boastful heart and a lack of common sense
Don't know how i found something so many others miss
Such simple times til we complicated them
But we won't lie awake at night and think what might have been
Fading southern ghost said time to go
Flooded summer streets time to leave
So we fell into the ocean
Drifted up the coast
Washed up in a town they say would swallow us up whole
That we call home
Home sweet home
And new starts cold hearts we got in return
Seems a shame the hard way's just one way that i learn
This cut-throat business is none of my concern
I could sit back quietly and watch this city
Watch this city
Watch this city burn
Cos this town it feeds on dreams and it's time to leave
The bright lights and the tourist traps said don't come back
So we follow in our headlights into the great unknown
Looking for something that we could not find on our own that we call home
Home sweet home
That we call home

We all fall just to rise again
Are we all who we pretend?
We all fall just to rise again
What makes us rise to the very end?

[Verse 1]
Listen… When I speak
Can’t be meek when the truth you seek
Know I creep where the floorboard creeks
Riddles in rhymes keep these lines oblique
I sit atop the highest peak
Wickedest born from the weak
My mystique makes the females shriek
They freak and geek for a future bleak
Home on the throne where I am king
Wood necklace on, fingers covered in rings
Vitruvian anthem is the song we sing
Ratio gold, son rise in spring
Which way does the pendulum swing?
Cosmic scales, math supreme
Try and fail, all between
Rise from depths in the unseen
Locked in a room with no mirrors
Hiding from a villain who couldn’t be realer
Lost in things from a past concealer
Speak with me these words of a healer
[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
They say he ain't mason cause he ain't up at the lodge
Actin’ like “Morals and Dogma” ain't up in my nog
Young Pike on barrage, Manly sabotage
Always look to God when I’m lost drifting in the fog
I’m the only one, left lying here to rot
Look inside to find your worth and everything your not
Square one starting spot, leaders fed to mobs
Suppress the hate inside I guess, 'til heads roll or they drop

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
The beast takes his shape, as we contemplate
How to outrun fate, when we’re always late
Imma do it 'til the sky and the earth trade place
Trace life back to the first Root Race
Distant clues for our world’s first base
Was it from within or out side space?
From where do we come? Is it one above?
Or many who loved Adam Kadmon?
Do you fear death or what comes next
Imma make the best from the worst don’t stress
A personal legend cannot be suppressed
Do what thou wilt with what I express

[Verse 4]
We arrive at the Hour of the Time
Brought on by these divine rhymes
Semper Lux to all who try
And never heed the Devil's lies
I imply that I give and grind
Just to find some time to die

Realization transformed to inspiration
Once i had the ring, on your finger I would place it
Waiting for the right moment , excercizing patience

Ain't stoppin imma do me till I die
Cos Ain't playin no games tryna make this paper day till night

Tryna make my pinky shine all bright
Tryna break bands on a daily
Tryna be something big
I guess all dreams till it happens g


Couldn't care if they chat on my name
Cos get it straight ain't doin nothin for the fame
And I just Stepped in the game but
Had to switch it up cos I can't even trust my own people now
24/7 onna grind

And if I have your back you better have mine
And ain't no snake buh if bro has beef I have beef I don't care what bond I break no

But still gotta look over your shoulder now and dеn cos this world is full of snakes that approach u like friends

Take I85 to 441, hit 98 and follow it on
To the first paved road past the Madison County line
Now that is the place that I come from
And the route I take when I go home to RFD 30529

My Daddy makes a living raising chickens and cows
And they're still living in the same old house
And Momma's in the kitchen talking on the party line
They bought a stereo and color TV, got a satellite dish
So they never miss me at RFD 30529

When his boy comes on Daddy likes to turn it up loud
And I'm so happy that I made my Momma proud
When I'm out on the road I never fail to drop them a line
Down to RFD 30529

I got to give credit where credit's due
Cause I wouldn't be standing here singing for you
If it hadn't of been for those good people of mine
Now you know the place that I'm coming from and the route I take
When I go home to RFD 30529

held a parade and begged the world to look inside

About the time I bought the coupe just to hang up out the roof
Drop them halves and wholes on Madden and I duck and block that boy the truth
Then I picked that Bentley up 'cause lately I ain't give a fuck
Snow pursue that rapping shit, your name is hot, you blowing up

Why no criminal investigation

The media forgot about it
Then they dropped the ball

It survived that crash to see another day
But those steel titanium engines
They didn’t make it
They disintegrated
They didn’t find one bit

There's a lot more to say about that terrible day
But hey don't believe me I'm just the singer here
Besides I just want to get a cold beer

Find out
Future's at stake
Come on now!

Take a stand
Is Your head buried in the sand?

Well we're not finished with all this shit
We still haven't talked about the pentagon hit

The jet plane that caused all the destruction
Terrorist pilot with little instruction
How could that be?

Take a stand
Get your head out of the sand

Don't forget about flight 93
It crashed in Shanksville
That's where it's supposed to be

It must of been a strong wind that carried it away

And you say, ""It must come from somewhere, it must live inside your head""

The truth is that I've hurt you, and once again I don't know why

A possession which they are free to treat as they wish

Is often reinforced by violence whether it is physical or emotional

That they are subservient to their parents' wishes
This is the first brutal step in the socialization process
Which teaches us all to become willing victims of exploitation
The first lessons of tyranny and oppression are learned in the home
The authority of the parent manifests itself in assault
The tradition of violence continues one generation after another with pathetic
Justifications such as, ""I was spanked, and I turned out fine, so I'll spank my kid.""
The cycle of violence must end somewhere
We must take the first step to not enforce the power relations
Between ourselves and others
We must speak out against violence between parent and child
We must show other that their violence will not be tolerated

But these rhymes go in circles like a child with a playhouse

Every day is just the same thing, nobody seems to see it
That the world has an algorithm, you can’t even say shit, save it
Crumple paper into pieces, hide it from the government and say you’ll pay the leases

Money’s everything nowadays don’t you understand, from fraud, stealing shit to selling weed and contraband like pack thе van
We moving out into the suburbs
The city keeps on growing with graffiti on thе outskirts of buildings

Bitches all up in their feelings bout the things people used to say but don’t they know that times have changed, it’s different days
So wear the noose around your neck, you say the wrong thing, slip up and now you’re dead, that’s how it feels

You tiptoe around conversations watching all your language like you on the television, we can’t beep it out
Our words are here to stay, they got folders on your history, your weaknesses, and pains

You touched my soul when you told me that you loved me
I didn’t know that you were lying, I had sipped the bubbly
I hate birthdays, they remind me that I’m fucking lonely
Funny how you say you care, but you never phone me
I’m a phony when it comes to being honest, cause I tell you that I’m okay but I’m listening to MOBO songs on replay, on repeat
The spreadsheet with my name displayed across it
The faucets that you use, have never cost shit

I’m speaking gibberish to past the time, I’m self-aware of everything but still
I seem to lie to all my fucking friends when I look em in the eyes
Still, I’m sitting down as the rain falls from the sky
Rapping on a beat, I’m a poet in disguise
I said the bar proudly but it’s one that I should hide
Cause it only represents the kinda guy that I despise

Saying things without a motive, like killing fools without a notice, you a maniac for doing that, you gotta lose em in your tracks
And I’m losing track of what I’m saying
On this track
And every time you come back, come crawling back
My heart is not a Mac, it’s something that you cannot hack

I call my brother on the phone, ask him if he heard it
Release my music online, you don’t need to buy it
I don’t need no fucking money, let me spit my lyrics
And can you tell me, when you see me, that you can hear it

And when you do, take the words in like the wood is burning
Inhale fumes from the weed, now you high as hell, might as well
Ring the bell and let em know that you are home
But this is not your home, it’s desolate, you are alone
I sit down by the lake where we’ll spread his ashes
I don’t need to see the future, see it all in flashes
I let the text be sent, now I’m losing cover
This the life that I will live out in the suburbs
Fuck",rap

Verse I
I've had rocks and big sticks thrown at me
I've seen tests and trials come my way
I've felt pain and heartache in my soul
But I'm strong, I'm strong enough

Pre-chorus
Cause Jesus changed my mind
Gave me brand new eyes
And He said; You gotta think right child

Chorus
And I think I'm strong enough
To stand against the current
I'm strong enough
To reign in this moment
Sometimes I'm over my head
But I heard Jesus say;
Child you're strong enough
So here I go yay
Versе II
I've had storms and floods come my way
A strong hurricane comе sweep me off my feet
I've had fear and doubt shake me to the core
But I'm strong, I'm strong enough

Pre-chorus
Cause Jesus changed my mind
Gave me brand new eyes
And He said; You gotta think right child

Chorus
And I think I'm strong enough
To stand against the current
I'm strong enough
To reign in this moment
Sometimes I'm over my head
But I heard Jesus say;
Child you're strong enough

When I'm weak He is strong
When I'm poor He is rich

Last time I was out of line with the last line
Thinking you would act kind
Thinking its a past-time I drink just to pass time
Thinking that I'm slipping got clinching to a past rhyme
And since lady luck left
All the pages I got left ain't nothing but second best
Second guessed stressed through days until the next
Threw away bad rhymes see at times I must confess
I'm a mess (yes) I keep calling SOS
But dont hear me when I'm shouting then I'm doubting what I said
And the smoke is in my chest smell the flavor in my breath
Trying to savored my behavior cause it changes with the next
How I can be myself I dont know who I am
I spent my whole life looking and rap understands
Dont do it for sales I do it for self
And I'm unique mate just like everybody else
I'm sorry
You ken that I'm sorry
For what I said what I done
For what I didn't and what I'm still going to get done [x2]

I'm sorry for the past rhymes
Last time a'l tell you this as we pass pints
Drinking with the hash mind
Thinking its a past-time drinking just to pass time
Thinking that I'm quitting this is different this is past rhymes
And its crazy see maybe cunts check
But the pages on the net ain't nothing but second best
To pressed so I'm getting depressed
These are hard times why I get out my bed
I'm upset and the sets SOS
You see me when I'm bouncing up this mountain that is stress
Position like its chess contradicting what I said
Keep on fighting keep on writing or a'l tighten up my neck
How I can keep living you just dont understand
They dont want to hear you rap better be in a band
Or be a banned left on the shelf
And I'm unique mate just like everyone else
I'm sorry

1235,"It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters. Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of revelry lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.

I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn; I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance- aye, chance, free will, and necessity- wise incompatible- all interweavingly working together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course- its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the last featuring blow at events.

Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.

“There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”

“Where-away?”

“On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”

Instantly all was commotion.

The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus.

“There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales disappeared.

“Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to Ahab.

The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills around, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter- this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers- that is, those not appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.

But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.",misc

8434,"The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. AT LENGTH I would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled -- but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.

It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued as was my won't, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile NOW was at the thought of his immolation.

He had a weak point -- this Fortunato -- although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian MILLIONAIRES. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially; I was skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.

It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man wore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him, that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.

I said to him -- ""My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to-day! But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.""

""How?"" said he, ""Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible ? And in the middle of the carnival?""

""I have my doubts,"" I replied; ""and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.""

""Amontillado!""

""I have my doubts.""

""Amontillado!""

""And I must satisfy them.""
""Amontillado!""

""As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi. If any one has a critical turn, it is he. He will tell me"" --

""Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.""

""And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.""

""Come let us go.""

""Whither?""

""To your vaults.""

""My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature. I perceive you have an engagement Luchesi"" --

""I have no engagement; come.""

""My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted . The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.""

""Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon; and as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.""

Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.

There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance , one and all, as soon as my back was turned.
I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the Montresors.

The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode.

""The pipe,"" said he.

""It is farther on,"" said I; ""but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls.""

He turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication.

""Nitre?"" he asked, at length

""Nitre,"" I replied. ""How long have you had that cough!""

""Ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh! -- ugh! ugh! ugh!

My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.

""It is nothing,"" he said, at last.

""Come,"" I said, with decision, we will go back; your health is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy as once I was. You are a man to be missed. For me it is no matter. We will go back; you will be ill and I cannot be responsible. Besides, there is Luchesi"" --

""Enough,"" he said; ""the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not die of a cough.""

""True -- true,"" I replied; ""and, indeed, I had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily -- but you should use all proper caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps.""
Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould.

""Drink,"" I said, presenting him the wine.

He raised it to his lips with a leer. He paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled.

""I drink,"" he said, ""to the buried that repose around us.""

""And I to your long life.""

He again took my arm and we proceeded.

""These vaults,"" he said, are extensive.""

""The Montresors,"" I replied, ""were a great numerous family.""

""I forget your arms.""

""A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.""

""And the motto?""

""Nemo me impune lacessit.""

""Good!"" he said.

The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy grew warm with the Medoc. We had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow.

""The nitre!"" I said, ""see it increases. It hangs like moss upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture trickle among the bones. Come, we will go back ere it is too late. Your cough"" --

""It is nothing"" he said; ""let us go on. But first, another draught of the Medoc.""

I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave. He emptied it at a breath. His eyes flashed with a fierce light. He laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.

I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the movement -- a grotesque one.

""You do not comprehend?"" he said.

""Not I,"" I replied.

""Then you are not of the brotherhood.""

""How?""

""You are not of the masons.""

""Yes, yes,"" I said ""yes! yes.""

""You? Impossible! A mason?""

""A mason,"" I replied.

""A sign,"" he said.

""It is this,"" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire.

""You jest,"" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. ""But let us proceed to the Amontillado.""

""Be it so,"" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued our route in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame.

At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. Its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead , in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.

It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depths of the recess. Its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see.

""Proceed,"" I said; ""herein is the Amontillado. As for Luchesi"" --

""He is an ignoramus,"" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered . A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short chain. from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was too much astounded to resist . Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess.

""Pass your hand,"" I said, ""over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. Indeed it is VERY damp. Once more let me IMPLORE you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I must first render you all the little attentions in my power.""

""The Amontillado!"" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment.

""True,"" I replied; ""the Amontillado.""

As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.

I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. It was NOT the cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the clanking subsided , I resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within.

A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. For a brief moment I hesitated -- I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, I began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs , and felt satisfied. I reapproached the wall. I replied to the yells of him who clamoured. I reechoed -- I aided -- I surpassed them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew still.

It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. I had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. I had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled with its weight; I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. It was succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice said --

""Ha! ha! ha! -- he! he! -- a very good joke indeed -- an excellent jest. We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo -- he! he! he! -- over our wine -- he! he! he!""

""The Amontillado!"" I said.

""He! he! he! -- he! he! he! -- yes, the Amontillado . But is it not getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.""

""Yes,"" I said ""let us be gone.""

""FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONTRESOR!""

""Yes,"" I said, ""for the love of God!""

But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. I called aloud --

""Fortunato!""

No answer. I called again --

""Fortunato!""

No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. There came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. My heart grew sick -- on account of the dampness of the catacombs. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the new masonry I reerected the old rampart of bones. For the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them.

Too late for a favour
This bruising hung a shade all over my head
And over my heart
There's no road back to the start
You said I'm in danger
It's so foolish to let a stranger into my head
Into my heart
All lust gets in trough a scar
And you should you know

[Chorus]
So if we fall in love
Promise not to change
And if we break it off
To never love again
I give you my word
Give a little sign that you heard

[Verse 2]
Lonely, and the rain falls
Love only is a pain I hope to indulge
One more time
But your will is not mine
I've tried living chainless and untied
But being painless hurt me so much
So hollow inside
Until I floated out with the tide
But darling, no

So if we fall in love
Promise not to change
And if we break it off
To never love again
I give you my word

Done to these people
Something cruel
Something mean
Something just
But the meaner the better
Goodness knows they deserve it
Have you ever dreamed of
Killing all the stupid people?
Not just the unintelligent people
But the sort that don't know anything about anything
But seem to have opinions about everything
They're only too ready to offer their advice about
How to run your life
And yet look at how they run their own lives
For the most part they've accomplished nothing
They've contributed nothing
Their lives are miserable
But they talk, talk, talk…
At the very least their tongues should be cut out
At the very least
Do you ever wanna
Kill all the people who tell lies?
Some certainly deserve it
Not necessarily the big liars
Or even those who teach lies as truth
I'm talking about people
Who say one thing and do another
Or who tell you they sent something express mail
When you know they haven't
Did you ever want to
Kill all the slow people in the world?
The people who are in front of you
When they should be behind you
A crime that the swift should be help back by the slow
And it's criminal that nothing is going to rectify it
And what about all the really ugly people?
Add them to the list as well
Some people try not to think about life's ugliness
I've thought about it
I've thought about it quite a lot
Something should be done to these people
Something to make them suffer
The way they've made us suffer
I say, bring back the Circus Maximus
For starters
Unless these weeds are dealt with
They'll poison everything
They are poisoning everything

A brutal gardener
A thorough, thoughtful gardener
An iron gardener

Am I outta my mind or am I just tripping
I know ain't hallucinating off the drinks I'm sipping
The only one that recognized your beauty no stripping
Type of girl to roll up with and just kick it
But at the same time still about her business
And thats the difference
Between her and the girls that you chill with
She be on that real shit
That baby mama drama is watchu gone have to deal with
Hoes see profits in pockets then they wanna steal it
You never know what type of hoe you dealing with
Hopefully she got nothing up her sleeves like tricks
Cuz you might get distracted cuz that ass is so thick
Money's her attraction she will catch you slipping quick
When you get to open wit her, when she comes around brick
You just never don't know if behind the door, you gon' get a lick hit
All cuz you trusted this bitch
Choose wisely when you pick

Don't you ever trust a bitch

There's a box of angel's feathers
And the bitter things they said

4659,"When I was young I used to want to be a polar bear ninja
Master of the shuriken, nunchucks and sabre
Now I'm older, I'm more comfortable with danger
Sometimes I still wish I was a polar bear ninja

They will not carry me in pine, they will scatter me
On the front doorstep of the first kid back at school who ever battered me
I take a pinch of salt with flattery
Cause who's line is it anyway?
Tony Slattery

Something had to be done, so I did it
Now I wish there was sixty-one seconds in every minute
To do what is never finished
In this mind all ideas rise to the top of the bubbles inside the Guinness
I will not know my limits

Cause it might be the difference between simply existing and really living
There is no prison like opinion given if two ears won't listen
You don't need eyes for vision, see, I can write five tunes decent
Release them every night to a crowd of unknown people
And if one of those people is seen to carry weight
And speaks in a magazine, if more people are going to believe them
Please, who are you dealing with?
I am not that creature
I'd rather cut my own left ear off than suffer these eijits
So much made with no reason
I want to leave a shape in the snow like a paw before I'm leaving

The wheel of fortune's spun
The needle's stuck between humdrum and one more tune done soon
I pass people in the street
I wonder how many feel completely controlled by a beat
We think we win once so we're told to repeat
But no matter who you know, we're all alone in defeat
And I take stock, like an Oxo thief

When I was young, I used to want to be a polar bear ninja
Master of the shuriken, nunchucks and sabre
Now I'm older, I'm more comfortable with danger
Sometimes I still wish I was a polar bear ninja

My eyes opened, thinking, not too tough
I guess I still don't know when I've had enough
Some things don't change
My old skull feels too small for my own brain
No pain, no gain, doesn't really apply to this one

? , get a tea
Have I got milk?  I'd better see
It's the habitual routine of a boy/man living his days
I blew one fifty last night
Now I'm digging for change
The Prince, the Pauper cliché, stuck in a loop
Either I,ve got dough and I blow it
Or I don't, and I fucking know it

That's the price you pay for living in the moment, you learn hard
When old friends are taking turns to buy their own yards
It kind of leaves you looking at your own cards
But I coughed this morning and some words came out of my mouth
Reminded me of what it is makes my world turn around

And so anyone who writes or plays
For nights and days
And fights to pay a rent
Might relate to the position of a visionary wishing to be given a wage
To exist as well as scribble on pages

The stage is set to make something out of nothing
Like The A Team
That's the reason why I never really sleep
I daydream

You see, I used to run with John
Back when Big Bird was yellow
He was Raphael, I was Donatello
Then when we moved to the big school I walked with Steven Strong
And every male friend of the family seemed to be an uncle
We chased the same girls, tamed the same curls
And our first shave in the very same sink, back at my Mum's
John would stay at mine, I'd stay at John's
We made beats on the Playstation for our MC alter egos to speak on
You're checking, this is the Polarbear, and I'm live!
I don't want four fish fingers with my beans and chips; I want five!
Know that, Nan!

The clarity of mentality shared
All we cared about was dreams and what we could do
We knew ?
Last time I saw John that ""could"" had become ""should""
And he had a three haircut, ripped jeans and overly clean shoes

We went out, kicked a couple of rums
Just an educated couple of bums, sat at a bar
Me with no money, him with a fast car
He in a nine to five, and me living to write
And as I walked home that night
I thought hard
About how I had a new name for my long list of safe, but different, mates

See, people move in enough different ways and different rays
And all I could think was, broken up, I wouldn't go complaining
Cause see, the grass is always greener
But I'm happy with my own grass
What I'm after is a little bit of that green to buy my own gas
Started in my own class
Polarbear's ""How to be Not Shit in Three Steps""
Now don't laugh

Step one:
Become extremely good at something
Step two:
Keep on getting better
And Step three, if you're wondering, is a warning:
If you're ever completely happy with what you've done
You're going to sleep thinking you're good
And wake up shit in the morning
I promise

Lesson over
Mr Polar
Go to the front of the class and show these so-called pros how they're supposed to do it
You know something's good when it seems like you already knew it
Now stop talking about that idea and do it
Get shit done, mate

Imagine writing something that reaches people
On a level, and equal
Leaves them needing a sequel
Getting straight to the point like the brand new needle
Like the guy who stepped over the street to get straight to the bar that's full of the right people

So there's a reason that I call it ""The Scene""
It's cause it's not real
It's just a rôle play with the same characters, just change their hairstyle
We're used to getting vexed as I'm making this bear smile
And whatever blows your hair back
Just give me my free drink

If I was here for the money I'd be rich by now
If I listened to all the talk I'd be a bitch by now
And by ""bitch"" I don't mean a derogatory term for girls
I refer to the worms
Only concerned with what they hope is cool

Cause people, let's face it
If lyrical ability and brilliant delivery made you famous
Then every one of us here would be wearing

5352,"Jimmie's occupation for a long time was to stand on streetcorners and watch the world go by, dreaming blood-red dreams at the passing of pretty women. He menaced mankind at the intersections of streets.

On the corners he was in life and of life. The world was going on and he was there to perceive it.

He maintained a belligerent attitude toward all well-dressed men. To him fine raiment was allied to weakness, and all good coats covered faint hearts. He and his order were kings, to a certain extent, over the men of untarnished clothes, because these latter dreaded, perhaps, to be either killed or laughed at.

Above all things he despised obvious Christians and ciphers with the chrysanthemums of aristocracy in their button-holes. He considered himself above both of these classes. He was afraid of neither the devil nor the leader of society.

When he had a dollar in his pocket his satisfaction with existence was the greatest thing in the world. So, eventually, he felt obliged to work. His father died and his mother's years were divided up into periods of thirty days.

He became a truck driver. He was given the charge of a painstaking pair of horses and a large rattling truck. He invaded the turmoil and tumble of the down-town streets and learned to breathe maledictory defiance at the police who occasionally used to climb up, drag him from his perch and beat him.

In the lower part of the city he daily involved himself in hideous tangles. If he and his team chanced to be in the rear he preserved a demeanor of serenity, crossing his legs and bursting forth into yells when foot passengers took dangerous dives beneath the noses of his champing horses. He smoked his pipe calmly for he knew that his pay was marching on.

If in the front and the key-truck of chaos, he entered terrifically into the quarrel that was raging to and fro among the drivers on their high seats, and sometimes roared oaths and violently got himself arrested.

After a time his sneer grew so that it turned its glare upon all things. He became so sharp that he believed in nothing. To him the police were always actuated by malignant impulses and the rest of the world was composed, for the most part, of despicable creatures who were all trying to take advantage of him and with whom, in defense, he was obliged to quarrel on all possible occasions. He himself occupied a down-trodden position that had a private but distinct element of grandeur in its isolation.

The most complete cases of aggravated idiocy were, to his mind, rampant upon the front platforms of all the street cars. At first his tongue strove with these beings, but he eventually was superior. He became immured like an African cow. In him grew a majestic contempt for those strings of street cars that followed him like intent bugs.

He fell into the habit, when starting on a long journey, of fixing his eye on a high and distant object, commanding his horses to begin, and then going into a sort of a trance of observation. Multitudes of drivers might howl in his rear, and passengers might load him with opprobrium, he would not awaken until some blue policeman turned red and began to frenziedly tear bridles and beat the soft noses of the responsible horses.
When he paused to contemplate the attitude of the police toward himself and his fellows, he believed that they were the only men in the city who had no rights. When driving about, he felt that he was held liable by the police for anything that might occur in the streets, and was the common prey of all energetic officials. In revenge, he resolved never to move out of the way of anything, until formidable circumstances, or a much larger man than himself forced him to it.

Foot-passengers were mere pestering flies with an insane disregard for their legs and his convenience. He could not conceive their maniacal desires to cross the streets. Their madness smote him with eternal amazement. He was continually storming at them from his throne. He sat aloft and denounced their frantic leaps, plunges, dives and straddles.

When they would thrust at, or parry, the noses of his champing horses, making them swing their heads and move their feet, disturbing a solid dreamy repose, he swore at the men as fools, for he himself could perceive that Providence had caused it clearly to be written, that he and his team had the unalienable right to stand in the proper path of the sun chariot, and if they so minded, obstruct its mission or take a wheel off.

And, perhaps, if the god-driver had an ungovernable desire to step down, put up his flame-colored fists and manfully dispute the right of way, he would have probably been immediately opposed by a scowling mortal with two sets of very hard knuckles.

It is possible, perhaps, that this young man would have derided, in an axle-wide alley, the approach of a flying ferry boat. Yet he achieved a respect for a fire engine. As one charged toward his truck, he would drive fearfully upon a sidewalk, threatening untold people with annihilation. When an engine would strike a mass of blocked trucks, splitting it into fragments, as a blow annihilates a cake of ice, Jimmie's team could usually be observed high and safe, with whole wheels, on the sidewalk. The fearful coming of the engine could break up the most intricate muddle of heavy vehicles at which the police had been swearing for the half of an hour.

A fire engine was enshrined in his heart as an appalling thing that he loved with a distant dog-like devotion. They had been known to overturn street-cars. Those leaping horses, striking sparks from the cobbles in their forward lunge, were creatures to be ineffably admired. The clang of the gong pierced his breast like a noise of remembered war.

When Jimmie was a little boy, he began to be arrested. Before he reached a great age, he had a fair record.

He developed too great a tendency to climb down from his truck and fight with other drivers. He had been in quite a number of miscellaneous fights, and in some general barroom rows that had become known to the police. Once he had been arrested for assaulting a Chinaman. Two women in different parts of the city, and entirely unknown to each other, caused him considerable annoyance by breaking forth, simultaneously, at fateful intervals, into wailings about marriage and support and infants.

Nevertheless, he had, on a certain star-lit evening, said wonderingly and quite reverently: ""Deh moon looks like hell, don't it?""",misc

I foresee me ever loosing
I Can not find some thing worth, wasting my time doing
Don't I deserve more then this
Drama bullshit is endless
The feelings of sleeplessness
Surrounds me so I find
Myself writing down
Thoughts waittin'
For the dawn
Hope today will be my day
Im Tired but don't even yawn
In my car I stay
Insomnia, restlessness
Unable to rest like the rest
Cradle my dreams
Of being the best of the best
Dragging me down
Drowning me
Under the unbearable stress
It's obscene I'm still living
At home with my folks
Try as I do and  roam but
I can't leave this scene
If there was a god their mean
Even for not believing
The repercussion seems hard
I try forget and drift
Away with the percussion
But my mental state stays
Deep thoughts are rushing
Through my head
I'd rather be in bed
But I'm here rapping instead,,
No fuel, can't use, my card
So I'm stuck, in my car
Tearing my, brain in half
Toke from the clear smoke
And raring to start
So I sit here smoking
And practising my on art
Looking for work
But hard to find effort
To begin the search
But i made the bed
Now i sleep in what's deserve
Counting change makes
Me feel worthless
I need a change yes
The Day to day way
I'm living is more likely
Gunna get me arrested
And I can't let my self
Live like this
Disown my life's past decisions
I'd need a restart
To get things right
Doin my own thing
Is barely getting me by
Only two ways out
I see are getting high
And watch my life strive, past
Driving in to the ground, fast
Or do the impossible
Bring my self out, of this faze
I'm going crazy
Stuck in a maze
Going round and round
Seeing the same sites
Over and over again
Isn't this the meaning of being insane
Doing this same thing
Over and over again
And expecting a different result
Im still awaiting
The landing
From my earlier pole vault
Will I bounce or roll
Hopefully bounce land
On my feet and feel tall
But I can't even think now
Wat is worth fighting for,,",rap

And cancer took my mom in Louisville
Some die young; fate and nature hold the gun
And others get to live
Why, I don’t know

They’ve locked me up in Bowling Green and Glasgow
And for good measure, down on the Bayou

It ain’t no fun in cuffs and shackles, son:
Locked up with some assholes that you don’t know

I learned to love and laugh and hurt in Nobob
And I’ve cried there more times than I’ve got socks

I don’t mind, ‘cause through the sands of time
The ups and downs is everything that we’ve got

Now, looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing
Except maybe all the times that I’ve been mean

But geez, thats so much work to go through man
So now its time for me to implement my back up plan
But damn, from local to international hoes
They either, likin' my style, or be feelin my flow

And bro shes quite the sight to see
At nineteen she stands five foot three Long brown hair and nice lil booty
So I walked up with words to say we locked eyes took my breath away
I must've looked super retarded cause she was asking if I was okay

I said excuse me miss I don't mean to interrupt you but
Later is there something that you're going to be up to
I would like to take you out tonight or for brunch guess that works too
Or a games night or laser tag you can pick anything to do it's cool

When she took off her coat my eyes were surprised to see
She was willingly wearing one of those old-school marvel tees
Caught every reference I made even finished half of them

Without a thing somehow
Help us to escape this cage
With heads hanging down
We search for a crown

No our love can't find a way

And we can't hide
From the beginning
Of our decline
As we fall apart
And try to restart
Another sad thing
We can deny for now

One of us will lose
The ability to choose
Another simple cold embrace
We try to conquer fears
But we end up in tears

Turn to steel bars,.

I don't know just how long I've been here
I'll just stare out the window and contemplate the sky
While I grow older than my years

Plucking strings at the site of my bed
By a stack of books most of which I've never read
I want to capture in sound the way things are
But I'd regret it in the morning if I smashed my guitar

Well they're never going to tell us just what's coming around the bend
But there's one thing I can count on

Owner claimed it missing
I came back for his children

If you think you can run
Then I stole a u-haul
And drove it through a fuckin’ wall

Full of broken slaves
None of them got names

Call me father 40 cause I’m cummin’ in the church

Woke up in the dirt

Then I hit a lick
Skull fracture, with my dick
Back in section eight
Pussy was so great
Now it’s getting late
Finna masturbate
Dick doesn’t work
So I popped a perc
Burning coal, oil, and gasoline
Fuck I hate the planet earth
Jet fuel can’t melt steel beams

Fuck I love Donald Trump
Orange and pink make me cum

Internal hemorrhage
I have a headache
It hurts more when I masturbate
Blood all on my dick

Lickin’ on used pads

Half a healthy weight

Punctured my skin and rub some heroin in

But you already knew that

I can’t have close friends because they’re part of the combine

The funny thing is, everyone that is knowingly part of the combine thinks they’re right

Everyone is a good person in their own perception

Everyone is three dimensional, Mysterio would never happen

Some people’s love kills them. Some people get love and lose themselves in the process. I feel worse for the latter

Places I’ve gone, things I’ve done, and they still are not proud of me

That probably explains why I’m such a motherfucker

Doing I’m what doing, dreams I’m pursuing, shouts to Maggie cuz now I’m blooming
Walking out of Bloomingdales, my life is just like you, beautiful, must be rich and evil with how much I pay attention to details
I done had the bars way before I ended up in jail
Course Roberts robbing me of life that’s the real crime
Never going back cuz this that rap gone have me being fine, People want back in my life they wanna meet me halfway
Or meet me in time

Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
Her stone-wash denim jeans are much
Darker than they seem
And oh, I've got a woman now

She said, ""My name is Eileen
Boy that's all you need
Oh, and this one's on the house
I don't mind""

My kid brother must have lied
He said he watered the lawn
So I turned the sprinklers on

Something flew in my eye
I almost broke down and cried
But off I went to school
When I walked into class
All the kids began to laugh

(Verse 1)

Tell copernicus I'm the center of solar systems
Flying through digital space that every soul was given

This life's been getting boring
Trump and Clinton so abhorrent
Close my eyes and hop the torrent
Cosmic trips forgetting Florence

There's no reason be stuck in 9 to 5s
Wasting life when you can travel skies at speed of thought

I

Sought thee truth behind existence
And after soul tripping this is where the Bright white light had brought me

I can teach you how to flyyyy
I can take you through the skieeees
I can free You from the lieeeees

Especially when you
Just realize that you've got the juice

There's no reason to hide
The universe is your guide
And all you gotta do (You gotta do)
Is drop your disguise

(Verse 2)
I
Floated for years while moving at the speed of light
Landed on planets where no one had a need to fight
While tied to a tether that had actually just seemed like
An umbilical chord illuminated by the brightest night

The views were tales of awe
Never really closed my jaw
Make me tell the Christians y'all
Never seen the works of God
This is the stuff of legend
Some things weren't so pleasant
I caught your mom and her henchmen sexing you're barely sexting

I joke I joke
Kids I kid
Triumph been tryna take these cosmic trips with the kid
This ain't no psychedelic euphoric insomniac trip
This is the soul searching space traversing story of a
Blip

I ain't different than people stuck in this reality
Puppets differ because some can notice their mortality
While you were mad about missing that shoe release date
I was busy studying scriptures on man's immortality

I can teach you how to flyyyy
I can take you through the skieeees
I can free You from the lieeeees
All you gotta do is you gotta do is drop your disguise

Dreams really do come true

Realize that you've got the juice

Dreams ain't nothing but combinations of memories
Its more of a compilation of different energies

Coming together to show you what you really are
You're a star tryna figure out how to get back on par

With the cosmos
Universal vibrations
See you been dumbed down with distractions and hating

The human condition is now an affliction
Cause without the eyes to realize y'all justify genocide
Black soul like you keep a couple popped pens inside
You tryna to tell people that's living like a pesticide
Tryna get the bugs off your brain they should meet their demise

Y'all tripping them demons is out to hurt you
And they been lying like angels living on earth too
It'd be start to write your dream journals

Swapping drinks with his buddy

Besides a flat tire sustained, rung
A stumble out the door

Strokin' my meat in the middle of Zoom class
Boring as hell, I ain't fuck wit yo lame ass
Fuckin' the homies and smokin' on gas
This bitch smell like poo poo I think I'mma pass!

Banned off of teams so I hop up on Zoom
I tell my thick classmate I'll talk to her soon
Crushin' the call cause I'm swaggin' til noon
My teacher she love me, she call me her boo (Aye!)

Pull up my front and I'm callin' yo mom
Hits after hits and I feel like a bong
I'm waker than teachers, I feel like that's wrong

You hear a boom!

Beating my dick in the middle of zoom class
Watch some hentai, making me nut fast
Call me a rapist, I didn't ask

I don't wanna be alone - where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone - where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone - where is my man?
I need a man who can take me then tount me and make me

Buy the things that I so richly deseerrve
A man who knows what I require
The things that I desire -
Is there anyone out there who has the neerrve?
I spend hours by the phone - where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone - where is my man?

Where is my baby? He can't be far
Look for an Ascot
A big cigar
Tell him to find me

Send his car to this address
I have to stress I need him now
I don't wanna be alone - where is my baby?
I don't wanna be alone - where is my man?
The kind of man that I adore's the kind of man that gives me more

Of all the better things in life that aren't free
Such things as summer by the sea
The Hamptons
Malibu
Capri

The kind of man
Who comes alive
When he comes near Rodeo Drive
Is the kind of man
Who winds my heart
With style and class

You know I've tried
Some other men
The kind with zeros
Less than ten
But everytime I grab
The ring it's always brass

I don't wanna be alone -
Where is my baby? . . 
I don't wanna be alone -

El dinero hay viene
Pero la amore si estando ahi

These days

I wonder why the world sleeping
I'm a dreamer I guess
Still speak for my soul you can see trough my chest
It ain’t hard to tell that these days people are stressed
Too busy staring at they screens to be aware of they breath
Keep it moving like the sun from the east to the west
Run the lake in the winter when im feeling depressed
Wondеr if they could relate or if thеy even impressed
I write these letters but the message rarely getting addressed
All your songs got me numb cuz I ain't feeling that shit
Catching up with sone homies I ain't seen in a grip
We laughed so hard forget we all been dealing with shit
If you listen to your soul it’ll be revealing your gift
Sometimes I only see potential I ain't seeing the flaws
Some people only see effects and/but they ain't seeing the cause
In this era new albums barely lasting a day
I could care but instead I made a classic today
These days I ain't broke
I ain't married to the money
But I keep enough on me just to travel round and eat right
These days I don't listen to the critics
Cuz I meant it when I said that I already know the beast typ
These days I ain't worried bout dying
I been more concerned with living in the moment cuz its all we got
These days im invested in my soul
Cuz its the only thing that really lasts forever, case you all forgot

Im making moves every month still im stressed on the first
Always hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Never taking it for granted so whatever its worth
Just don't wait until you’re dead, and know there’s heaven on earth
Been busy still I got some of my time to give
Cuz you're worth it and we only got this one life to live
Just wanted to be free
Free like minded kids
But how they say it be, is never quite like it is
Ain’t ashamed how we changed Im inspired by growth
You never hearing me complain though im tired and broke
Worte these bars in the middle of the night when I woke
Turn your thoughts into action stop relying on hope
Though Im still tryn to cope it ain't easy to do
Im really talking to my self when im speaking to you
Yeah they still call me chief like its back in the day
I could get high but instead I wrote a classic today, ah
These days I ain't ballin till I gotta couple dollars
I ain't dealing cuz I got enough shit to deal with out here on my own
These days I ain’t work a 9-5
I've been traveling the world yet Im feeling like im close to home
These days im more focussed on my future
Letting go of my past and them things that I cannot change
These days I don't see it how I used to cuz the money come and go
But that love does always stay the same

I came to drink alone, that's where I ran into you
Or, I guess I should say, you ran into me and
I could tell right away that fate had somethin' up its sleeve

It started right there with a laugh and a drink or two
Wound up with a later that night kiss in a corner booth and
When the Lights came on, they yelled last call
I remember sayin', yeah, I remember sayin' to ya baby

I'll take one more of everything
Your smile, your kiss, your sweet, your crazy
Can't ever tell what tomorrow brings
If we wait around too long, it might be long gone
So
I'll take a one more of everything

Storms like you don't just come along every day
When they do, most the time, they blow in then they're gone away but

You keep crashing in
Stronger than a tidal wave
No matter how many times
I'm always gonna feel the same
I'll take one more of everything
Your smile, your kiss, your sweet, your crazy
Can't ever tell what tomorrow brings

He’s crying  on and on and on and on his baby’s name
From Saigon swamps to Washington
Wind could hear him say

The guns are speaking     their killing language
These words can’t clean    my blood-stained bandage
My little Harry   please,  hear your daddy
Throw your tin soldiers   there ain’t no war games

Lonely boy in 1971 came back home
Voices said “matriculation number 31”
His hair’s gone grey with surrendered bodies lyin’ dead
His eyes were red for all the blood they saw in Vietnam
He’s calling on and on and on his baby’s name
The guns are speaking     their killing language
These words can’t clean    my blood-stained bandage
My little Harry   please,  hear your daddy
Throw your tin soldiers   there ain’t no war games

He said “rather lose than let those victims mourn at my feet”
There ain’t no winners   there ain’t no medals
He killed a man, then Mr., what’s the gain?

Came from nothin', now I'm killin' the game with a fuckin' vengeance

And fuck you too, I got my middle fingers up
One for the haters and one sayin' that I just don't give a fuck
I'm not in this for the cheese, I don't rap for fuckin' cheddar
I still slice you bitches up, because I'm only gettin' greater, haha
Don't be lookin' at me like you didn't see it coming
6th tracks in, and you know that I'm buzzin'?
I walked in this bitch like I was summoned
I opened that door, all I saw was nothin'
They don't want the smoke, I hold the lighter
Spittin' butane bars, that's how I start the fire
I'll come out swingin' when I hear that knockin'
You better be hopin' that our paths ain't crossin'
Damn, bruh, yeah, I can feel it now
No, country rap ain't ready like I'm raidin' the town

Covers his eyes with his hands 'cause

Everyone knows that it's scary out there
When you jump to the wet side
Where it's colder, it's louder, it's screamin' with life
And it's way complex
Hacking through all the harsh effects

Mick goes for the bomb
One of those wax looking angel food wheelies
With the gunk on the top
She gives him back a quarter
Her hand touched his
You can feel the flames arching
Over the roof of the shop
For a moment they spun on the edge of history
Fell into animal time 'cause
Everyone knows that it's scary out there
When you jump to the wet side
Where it's colder, it's louder, it's screamin' with life
And it's way complex
Hacking through all the harsh effects

Back out on the tarmac
It was alive with the sweet sounds of summer
Oh, the steamer's alright (Steamer's alright)
Mick tries to remember
Something kinda cool but it's already fading
Back to straight black and white
Maybe I needed a hit of down time
Covers his eyes with his hands cause

Everyone knows that it's scary out there
When you jump to the wet side
Where it's colder, it's louder, it's screamin' with life
And it's way complex
Hacking through all the harsh effects

Everyone knows that it's scary out there
When you jump to the wet side
Where it's colder, it's louder, it's screamin' with life

Well, dear reader, Chapter XII was short, and I hope you found it sweet.

But remember, this is an essay on Child Consciousness, not a tract on Salvation. It isn't my fault that I am led at moments into exhortation.

Well, then, what about it? One fact now seems very clear—at any rate to me. We've got to pause. We haven't got to gird our loins with a new frenzy and our larynxes with a new Glory Song. Not a bit of it. Before you dash off to put salt on the tail of a new religion or of a new Leader of Men, dear reader, sit down quietly and pull yourself together. Say to yourself: ""Come now, what is it all about?"" And you'll realize, dear reader, that you're all in a fluster, inwardly. Then say to yourself: ""Why am I in such a fluster?"" And you'll see you've no reason at all to be so: except that it's rather exciting to be in a fluster, and it may seem rather stale eggs to be in no fluster at all about anything. And yet, dear little reader, once you consider it quietly, it's so much nicer not to be in a fluster. It's so much nicer not to feel one's deeper innards storming like the Bay of Biscay. It is so much better to get up and say to the waters of one's own troubled spirit: Peace, be still ...! And they will be still ... perhaps.

And then one realizes that all the wild storms of anxiety and frenzy were only so much breaking of eggs. It isn't our business to live anybody's life, or to die anybody's death, except our own. Nor to save anybody's soul, nor to put anybody in the right; nor yet in the wrong, which is more the point to-day. But to be still, and to ignore the false fine frenzy of the seething world. To turn away, now, each one into the stillness and solitude of his own soul. And there to remain in the quiet with the Holy Ghost which is to each man his own true soul.

This is the way out of the vicious circle. Not to rush round on the periphery, like a rabbit in a ring, trying to break through. But to retreat to the very center, and there to be filled with a new strange stability, polarized in unfathomable richness with the center of centers. We are so silly, trying to invent devices and machines for flying off from the surface of the earth. Instead of realizing that for us the deep satisfaction lies not in escaping, but in getting into the perfect circuit of the earth's terrestrial magnetism. Not in breaking away. What is the good of trying to break away from one's own? What is the good of a tree desiring to fly like a bird in the sky, when a bird is rooted in the earth as surely as a tree is? Nay, the bird is only the topmost leaf of the tree, fluttering in the high air, but attached as close to the tree as any other leaf. Mr. Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not supersede the Newtonian Law of Gravitation or of Inertia. It only says, ""Beware! The Law of Inertia is not the simple ideal proposition you would like to make of it. It is a vast complexity. Gravitation is not one elemental uncouth force. It is a strange, infinitely complex, subtle aggregate of forces."" And yet, however much it may waggle, a stone does fall to earth if you drop it.

We should like, vulgarly, to rejoice and say that the new Theory of Relativity releases us from the old obligation of centrality. It does no such thing. It only makes the old centrality much more strange, subtle, complex, and vital. It only robs us of the nice old ideal simplicity. Which ideal simplicity and logicalness has become such a fish-bone stuck in our throats.

The universe is once more in the mental melting-pot. And you can melt it down as long as you like, and mutter all the jargon and abracadabra, aldeboronti fosco fornio of science that mental monkey-tricks can teach you, you won't get anything in the end but a formula and a lie. The atom? Why, the moment you discover the atom it will explode under your nose. The moment you discover the ether it will evaporate. The moment you get down to the real basis of anything, it will dissolve into a thousand problematic constituents. And the more problems you solve, the more will spring up with their fingers at their nose, making a fool of you.

There is only one clue to the universe. And that is the individual soul within the individual being. That outer universe of suns and moons and atoms is a secondary affair. It is the death-result of living individuals. There is a great polarity in life itself. Life itself is dual. And the duality is life and death. And death is not just shadow or mystery. It is the negative reality of life. It is what we call Matter and Force, among other things.

Life is individual, always was individual and always will be. Life consists of living individuals, and always did so consist, in the beginning of everything. There never was any universe, any cosmos, of which the first reality was anything but living, incorporate individuals. I don't say the individuals were exactly like you and me. And they were never wildly different.
And therefore it is time for the idealist and the scientist—they are one and the same, really—to stop his monkey-jargon about the atom and the origin of life and the mechanical clue to the universe. There isn't any such thing. I might as well say: ""Then they took the cart, and rubbed it all over with grease. Then they sprayed it with white wine, and spun round the right wheel five hundred revolutions to the minute and the left wheel, in the opposite direction, seven hundred and seventy-seven revolutions to the minute. Then a burning torch was applied to each axle. And lo, the footboard of the cart began to swell, and suddenly as the cart groaned and writhed, the horse was born, and lay panting between the shafts."" The whole scientific theory of the universe is not worth such a tale: that the cart conceived and gave birth to the horse.

I do not believe one-fifth of what science can tell me about the sun. I do not believe for one second that the moon is a dead world spelched off from our globe. I do not believe that the stars came flying off from the sun like drops of water when you spin your wet hanky. I have believed it for twenty years, because it seemed so ideally plausible. Now I don't accept any ideal plausibilities at all. I look at the moon and the stars, and I know I don't believe anything that I am told about them. Except that I like their names, Aldebaran and Cassiopeia, and so on.

I have tried, and even brought myself to believe in a clue to the outer universe. And in the process I have swallowed such a lot of jargon that I would rather listen now to a negro witch-doctor than to Science. There is nothing in the world that is true except empiric discoveries which work in actual appliances. I know that the sun is hot. But I won't be told that the sun is a ball of blazing gas which spins round and fizzes. No, thank you.

At length, for my part, I know that life, and life only is the clue to the universe. And that the living individual is the clue to life. And that it always was so, and always will be so.

When the living individual dies, then is the realm of death established. Then you get Matter and Elements and atoms and forces and sun and moon and earth and stars and so forth. In short, the outer universe, the Cosmos. The Cosmos is nothing but the aggregate of the dead bodies and dead energies of bygone individuals. The dead bodies decompose as we know into earth, air, and water, heat and radiant energy and free electricity and innumerable other scientific facts. The dead souls likewise decompose—or else they don't decompose. But if they do decompose, then it is not into any elements of Matter and physical energy. They decompose into some psychic reality, and into some potential will. They reënter into the living psyche of living individuals. The living soul partakes of the dead souls, as the living breast partakes of the outer air, and the blood partakes of the sun. The soul, the individuality, never resolves itself through death into physical constituents. The dead soul remains always soul, and always retains its individual quality. And it does not disappear, but reënters into the soul of the living, of some living individual or individuals. And there it continues its part in life, as a death-witness and a life-agent. But it does not, ordinarily, have any separate existence there, but is incorporate in the living individual soul. But in some extraordinary cases, the dead soul may really act separately in a living individual.

How this all is, and what are the laws of the relation between life and death, the living and the dead, I don't know. But that this relation exists, and exists in a manner as I describe it, for my own part I know. And I am fully aware that once we direct our living attention this way, instead of to the absurdity of the atom, then we have a whole living universe of knowledge before us. The universe of life and death, of which we, whose business it is to live and to die, know nothing. Whilst concerning the universe of Force and Matter we pile up theories and make staggering and disastrous discoveries of machinery and poison-gas, all of which we were much better without.

It is life we have to live by, not machines and ideals. And life means nothing else, even, but the spontaneous living soul which is our central reality. The spontaneous, living, individual soul, this is the clue, and the only clue. All the rest is derived.

How it is contrived that the individual soul in the living sways the very sun in its centrality, I do not know. But it is so. It is the peculiar dynamic polarity of the living soul in every weed or bug or beast, each one separately and individually polarized with the great returning pole of the sun, that maintains the sun alive. For I take it that the sun is the great sympathetic center of our inanimate universe. I take it that the sun breathes in the effluence of all that fades and dies. Across space fly the innumerable vibrations which are the basis of all matter. They fly, breathed out from the dying and the dead, from all that which is passing away, even in the living. These vibrations, these elements pass away across space, and are breathed back again. The sun itself is invisible as the soul. The sun itself is the soul of the inanimate universe, the aggregate clue to the substantial death, if we may call it so. The sun is the great active pole of the sympathetic death-activity. To the sun fly the vibrations or the molecules in the great sympathy-mode of death, and in the sun they are renewed, they turn again as the great gift back again from the sympathetic death-center towards life, towards the living. But it is not even the dead which really sustain the sun. It is the dynamic relation between the solar plexus of individuals and the sun's core, a perfect circuit. The sun is materially composed of all the effluence of the dead. But the quick of the sun is polarized with the living, the sun's quick is polarized in dynamic relation with the quick of life in all living things, that is, with the solar plexus in mankind. A direct dynamic connection between my solar plexus and the sun.

Likewise, as the sun is the great fiery, vivifying pole of the inanimate universe, the moon is the other pole, cold and keen and vivifying, corresponding in some way to a voluntary pole. We live between the polarized circuit of sun and moon. And the moon is polarized with the lumbar ganglion, primarily, in man. Sun and moon are dynamically polarized to our actual tissue, they affect this tissue all the time.

The moon is, as it were, the pole of our particular terrestrial volition, in the universe. What holds the earth swinging in space is first, the great dynamic attraction to the sun, and then counterposing assertion of independence, singleness, which is polarized in the moon. The moon is the clue to our earth's individual identity, in the wide universe.

The moon is an immense magnetic center. It is quite wrong to say she is a dead snowy world with craters and so on. I should say she is composed of some very intense element, like phosphorus or radium, some element or elements which have very powerful chemical and kinetic activity, and magnetic activity, affecting us through space.

It is not the sun which we see in heaven. It is the rushing thither and the rushing thence of the vibrations expelled by death from the body of life, and returned back again to the body of life. Possibly even a dead soul makes its journey to the sun and back, before we receive it again in our breast. Just as the breath we breathe out flies to the sun and back, before we breathe it in again. And as the water that evaporates rises right to the sun, and returns here. What we see is the great golden rushing thither, from the death exhalation, towards the sun, as a great cloud of bees flying to swarm upon the invisible queen, circling round, and loosing again. This is what we see of the sun. The center is invisible for ever.

And of the moon the same. The moon has her back to us for ever. Not her face, as we like to think. The moon also pulls the water, as the sun does. But not in evaporation. The moon pulls by the magnetic force we call gravitation. Gravitation not being quite such a Newtonian simple apple as we are accustomed to find it, we are perhaps farther off from understanding the tides of the ocean than we were before the fruit of the tree fell to Sir Isaac's head. It is certainly not simple little-things tumble-towards-big-things gravitation. In the moon's pull there is peculiar, quite special force exerted over those water-born substances, phosphorus, salt, and lime. The dynamic energy of salt water is something quite different from that of fresh water. And it is this dynamic energy which the sea gives off, and which connects it with the moon. And the moon is some strange coagulation of substance such as salt, phosphorus, soda. It certainly isn't a snowy cold world, like a world of our own gone cold. Nonsense. It is a globe of dynamic substance like radium or phosphorus, coagulated upon a certain vivid pole of energy, which pole of energy is directly polarized with our earth, in opposition with the sun.
The moon is born from the death of individuals. All things, in their oneing, their unification into the pure, universal oneness, evaporate and fly like an imitation breath towards the sun. Even the crumbling rocks breathe themselves off in this rocky death, to the sun of heaven, during the day.

But at the same time, during the night they breathe themselves off to the moon. If we come to think of it, light and dark are a question both of the third body, the intervening body, what we will call, by stretching a point, the individual. As we all know, apart from the existence of molecules of individual matter, there is neither light nor dark. A universe utterly without matter, we don't know whether it is light or dark. Even the pure space between the sun and moon, the blue space, we don't know whether, in itself, it is light or dark. We can say it is light, we can say it is dark. But light and dark are terms which apply only to ourselves, the third, the intermediate, the substantial, the individual.

If we come to think of it, light and dark only mean whether we have our face or our back towards the sun. If we have our face to the sun, then we establish the circuit of cosmic or universal or material or infinite sympathy. These four adjectives, cosmic, universal, material, and infinite are almost interchangeable, and apply, as we see, to that realm of the non-individual existence which we call the realm of the substantial death. It is the universe which has resulted from the death of individuals. And to this universe alone belongs the quality of infinity: to the universe of death. Living individuals have no infinity save in this relation to the total death-substance and death-being, the summed-up cosmos.

Light and dark, these great wonders, are relative to us alone. These are two vast poles of the cosmic energy and of material existence. These are the vast poles of cosmic sympathy, which we call the sun, and the other white pole of cosmic volition, which we call the moon. To the sun belong the great forces of heat and radiant energy, to the moon belong the great forces of magnetism and electricity, radium-energy, and so on. The sun is not, in any sense, a material body. It is an invariable intense pole of cosmic energy, and what we see are the particles of our terrestrial decomposition flying thither and returning, as fine grains of iron would fly to an intense magnet, or better, as the draught in a room veers towards the fire, attracted infallibly, as a moth towards a candle. The moth is drawn to the candle as the draught is drawn to the fire, in the absolute spell of the material polarity of fire. And air escapes again, hot and different, from the fire. So is the sun.

Fire, we say, is combustion. It is marvelous how science proceeds like witchcraft and alchemy, by means of an abracadabra which has no earthly sense. Pray, what is combustion? You can try and answer scientifically, till you are black in the face. All you can say is that it is that which happens when matter is raised to a certain temperature—and so forth and so forth. You might as well say, a word is that which happens when I open my mouth and squeeze my larynx and make various tricks with my throat muscles. All these explanations are so senseless. They describe the apparatus, and think they have described the event.

Fire may be accompanied by combustion, but combustion is not necessarily accompanied by fire. All A is B, but all B is not A. And therefore fire, no matter how you jiggle, is not identical with combustion. Fire. FIRE. I insist on the absolute word. You may say that fire is a sum of various phenomena. I say it isn't. You might as well tell me a fly is a sum of wings and six legs and two bulging eyes. It is the fly which has the wings and legs, and not the legs and wings which somehow nab the fly into the middle of themselves. A fly is not a sum of various things. A fly is a fly, and the items of the sum are still fly.

So with fire. Fire is an absolute unity in itself. It is a dynamic polar principle. Establish a certain polarity between the moon-principle and the sun-principle, between the positive and negative, or sympathetic and volitional dynamism in any piece of matter, and you have fire, you have the sun-phenomenon. It is the sudden flare into the one mode, the sun mode, the material sympathetic mode. Correspondingly, establish an opposite polarity between the sun-principle and the water-principle, and you have decomposition into water, or towards watery dissolution.

There are two sheer dynamic principles in our universe, the sun-principle and the moon-principle. And these principles are known to us in immediate contact as fire and water. The sun is not fire. But the principle of fire is the sun-principle. That is, fire is the sudden swoop towards the sun, of matter which is suddenly sun-polarized. Fire is the sudden sun-assertion, the release towards the one pole only. It is the sudden revelation of the cosmic One Polarity, One Identity.

But there is another pole. There is the moon. And there is another absolute and visible principle, the principle of water. The moon is not water. But it is the soul of water, the invisible clue to all the waters.

So that we begin to realize our visible universe as a vast dual polarity between sun and moon. Two vast poles in space, invisible in themselves, but visible owing to the circuit which swoops between them, round them, the circuit of the universe, established at the cosmic poles of the sun and moon. This then is the infinite, the positive infinite of the positive pole, the sun-pole, negative infinite of the negative pole, the moon-pole. And between the two infinites all existence takes place.

But wait. Existence is truly a matter of propagation between the two infinites. But it needs a third presence. Sun-principle and moon-principle, embracing through the æons, could never by themselves propagate one molecule of matter. The hailstone needs a grain of dust for its core. So does the universe. Midway between the two cosmic infinites lies the third, which is more than infinite. This is the Holy Ghost Life, individual life.

It is so easy to imagine that between them, the two infinites of the cosmos propagated life. But one single moment of pause and silence, one single moment of gathering the whole soul into knowledge, will tell us that it is a falsity. It was the living individual soul which, dying, flung into space the two wings of the infinite, the two poles of the sun and the moon. The sun and the moon are the two eternal death-results of the death of individuals. Matter, all matter, is the Life-born. And what we know as inert matter, this is only the result of death in individuals, it is the dead bodies of individuals decomposed and resmelted between the hammer and anvil, fire and sand of the sun and the moon. When time began, the first individual died, the poles of the sun and moon were flung into space, and between the two, in a strange chaos and battle, the dead body was torn and melted and smelted, and rolled beneath the feet of the living. So the world was formed, always under the feet of the living.

And so we have a clue to gravitation. We, mankind, are all one family. In our individual bodies burns the positive quick of all things. But beneath our feet, in our own earth, lies the intense center of our human, individual death, our grave. The earth has one center, to which we are all polarized. The circuit of our life is balanced on the living soul within us, as the positive center, and on the earth's dark center, the center of our abiding and eternal and substantial death, our great negative center, away below. This is the circuit of our immediate individual existence. We stand upon our own grave, with our death fire, the sun, on our right hand, and our death-damp, the moon, on our left.
The earth's center is no accident. It is the great individual pole of us who die. It is the center of the first dead body. It is the first germ-cell of death, which germ-cell threw out the great nuclei of the sun and the moon. To this center of our earth we, as humans, are eternally polarized, as are our trees. Inevitably, we fall to earth. And the clue of us sinks to the earth's center, the clue of our death, of our weight. And the earth flings us out as wings to the sun and moon: or as the death-germ dividing into two nuclei. So from the earth our radiance is flung to the sun, our marsh-fire to the moon, when we die.

We fall into the earth. But our rising was not from the earth. We rose from the earthless quick, the unfading life. And earth, sun, and moon are born only of our death. But it is only their polarized dynamic connection with us who live which sustains them all in their place and maintains them all in their own activities. The inanimate universe rests absolutely on the life-circuit of living creatures, is built upon the arch which spans the duality of living beings.",misc

I've been stuck in this nightmare, feeling like I might tear
My eyelids out right here there's something I can't fight here
I've been stuck in this dream, in this dream, in this dream
I've been stuck in this nightmare, feeling like I might tear
My eyelids out right here there's something I can't fight here

This my, black album I got 99 problems
And I've been tearing out my hair, like baldness would solve 'em
Tonight it feels so dark send my regards to tomorrow
Cause I don't know if I'mma see him every nights a coliseum
Stuck in this requiem all my deepest fears I feed em
They started out as seeds now they starting to grow leaves
And soon they will be trees and nest these birds and bees
They committing burglaries my goals were murdered first degree
First I ain't believe it, but since I've seen it
Every single thing I see between it seems so scenic
And I can't free it, I can't free it
My mind is in a prison I've been living with this demon
Sharing cells in hell and I'm feinin
For the feeling of comfort now I need it
In my life, used to have some fight
Inside of me but, since it left I ain't felt right
My stomach turns, my tongue it burns
My lungs they hurt, like they gone fuckin burst
Cause I've been breathless as I'm laying here restrained
A victim of this torture but it's all just in my brain
Am I cruel enough to do this to myself?
Tell the man in the mirror please don't judge me by my wealth
Cause I've been searching for, something more personal
But in this world I'm worthless, and that hurts to know
That hurts ya know, try not to curse it
These words ain't permanent, no time for cursive
Cause paper burns, and language changes
Someday noone will know, the pain contained in these pages
Hard to face it, feeling ageless
Tryna keep people away from me anxiety's contagious
Not too sure that society can take this
But I've been trapped behind this wall it takes like five of me to break it
I can't climb it neither, some people find a preacher
Some even find a teacher, me I ain't trying neither
I ain't crying either, I might be lying feet first
I might be high on reefer, that's cause sobriety hurts
Trying to find a T-Shirt, I'm feeling under dressed
In the front of the class, man I'm a fuckin mess
Breaking down, breaking up
Breaking bad lost my mind tryna take it back
Pt.2

(Demonic Voice):
I'm coming after you, after you
I'm coming after you, Mr. Rapper dude (x2)
This shit got you paranoid, paranoid (x3)
This shit got you paranoid tearing out ya hair boy
Cause the fake they afraid of the truth, afraid of the truth
Cause the fake they afraid of the truth, you ain't superman you just change in the booth
I got that kryptonite for ya, for ya (x3)
With a flow so hot I'mma boil ya, boy ya
Treat you like my son, and I ain't got one
That means you a nobody, hop on the track get ya flow bodied
You frosty the snowman, and I'm a heata
You just a typo, typo, time to delete ya

Fuckin these tracks this shit is porn to me, killing hip hop shit is bor'n to me

Tryna be who the younger me sworn to be I wouldn't buy your music if it came with warranties
Sick of corny beats from cereal artists, who probably got their microphones from Cheerio boxes
Me and my team we some serious bosses y'all thinner than the plastic bags I keep all my pot in
First show in Escanaba I was eating Neurottin every song I played then shit I probably forgotten
But can you blame me ten mixtapes later lemme put a rubber glove on and fist these haters
Lemme pause, that's a metaphor, tryna diss better work on your respirator'
Cause I got some grimy shit in my repertoire so lemme hear some new shit you ain't said before
Y'all broken pianos broke projectors man we heard it all, seen it all come better planned
Lanky motha fucka pulling treys like Kev Durant, you just old an washed up, like Letterman's

Six lives are over

Look to the father for the truth
The killer smiles without a tooth
Mothers weep as angels die
Witches burn for Salem's lies

These poor children gave their lives
Castrations upon the knife
Frozen still upon the ground
A life once lost without a sound

The truth will never set you free
A muting of the callow
Execute this paradise
Upon thy graves so shallow

Witch hunt is over

What we face is the price to pay
It is all debased and defiled
By the ignorant we nominate
To eradicate evidence of DNA

11:11- I wish to see my homies in heaven
Forgetting all my insecurities the older I’m getting
Grow in the moment- my moment is momentarily frozen
As I compose my next move those who hated I disown em
Fuck em
I’m self destructing stressing all over nothing
Got a little krispy kreme but now I crave it by the dozen
Got a couple women who try to show affection in public
Publicly I’ll admit it all these bitches I don’t love em
I should
But I’m on the verge of “remember when we were nothing?”
Sitting in mama’s crib fantasizing we was buzzing
Me Jimmy T and my cousins, Petie Rico Gene myself
We made a fucking name with no motherfucking help
And now it’s up, up, and away best regards from better days
Stuck in a maze but best believe in God I pray we’ll find a way
A way out from living usual routes
Minority in college, fuck the whole sorority house

Turned steak out of ramen thanks to rhymin

I never fear a man because men are merely mortal
Water and oil mixed emotions hope my devotion never spoils
And if it does then, fuck it, I’ll just bring it right back
Studio where lately I’ve been spending all my nights at
You want a war? well fight back, kamikaze on em
Sipping FIJI water laying out like iguanas in autumn
So what’s the problem never seem to see the cons in life
Lying to my kin like “I’m alright” they know I’m kinda nice
Blowing these o’s like bubbles arose from rubble and now
I’m telescopic hubblin In ‘n Out the bank like double doubles
Those who once hated now saying they want no trouble
Probably because my plays could kick a starter out the huddle
And I took my rainy days and made a pool up out the puddle
Big party, big things, forever remaining humble
Rep for the jungle those who thought we’d be animal mink
Same motherfuckers at the bar trying to buy us a drink
Better mind your p’s and q’s cause I give a fuck what you think
I give a fuck what you like, like it or take it and leave
Live for the dreams but be ready to die for the cause
Small world but it’s so big when this love is involved

4780,"We received a call at 5:44am from our security company alerting us of our motion detectors going off in our Skydome area of the Museum.  Upon arrival it was discovered that a sinkhole had collapsed within the Museum.  No one was in or around the Museum at the time.  The Bowling Green Fire Department arrived on the scene and secured the area.  The Fire Department has estimated the size of the hole is 40 feet across and 25-30 feet deep.

It is with heavy hearts that we report that eight Corvettes were affected by this incident.  Those cars include:

1993 ZR-1 Spyder on loan from General Motors
2009 ZR1 “Blue Devil” on loan from General Motors

The other six vehicles were owned by the National Corvette Museum including:

1962 Black Corvette
1984 PPG Pace Car
1992 White 1 Millionth Corvette
1993 Ruby Red 40th Anniversary Corvette
2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette
2009 White 1.5 Millionth Corvette

None of the cars affected were on loan from individuals.  The Skydome exhibit area of the Museum is a separate structure connected to the main Museum.  A structural engineer is now on-site to assess the existing damage and stability of the surrounding areas.  The Museum is closed to the public for the day to allow us to carefully assess the situation.  We will keep everyone informed as we know more.

With the 20th Anniversary celebration, Grand Opening of the NCM Motorsports Park, and the National Corvette Caravan coming August 27-30, we’ve got a lot to be excited about in 2014, and look forward to getting the Skydome repaired and reopened very soon.",misc

126,"Telegram To The Secretary Of The Navy.

Headquarters Army Potomac, April 9, 1863.

HON. SECRETARY OF THE NAVY:

Richmond Whig of the 8th has no telegraphic despatches from Charleston, but has the following as editorial:

""All thoughts are now centred upon Charleston. Official intelligence was made public early yesterday morning that the enemy's iron-clad fleet had attempted to cross the bar and failed, but later in the day it was announced that the gunboats and transports had succeeded in crossing and were at anchor. Our iron-clads lay between the forts quietly awaiting the attack. Further intelligence is looked for with eager anxiety. The Yankees have made no secret of this vast preparation for an attack on Charleston, and we may well anticipate a desperate conflict. At last the hour of trial has come for Charleston, the hour of deliverance or destruction, for no one believes the other alternative, surrender, possible. The heart of the whole country yearns toward the beleaguered city with intense solicitude, yet with hopes amounting to confidence. Charleston knows what is expected of her, and which is due to her fame, and to the relation she sustains to the cause. The devoted, the heroic, the great-hearted Beauregard is there, and he, too, knows what is expected of him and will not disappoint that expectation. We predict a Saragossa defense, and that if Charleston is taken it will be only a heap of ruins.""

The rebel pickets are reported as calling over to our pickets today that we had taken some rebel fort. This is not very intelligible, and I think is entirely unreliable.

I'd gone in the den and turned on the TV
When she walked in and kissed me
On the cheek like a million times before
And she said ""Honey, I know It's late
But if you don't mind, My shoppings gotten a little behind
So I think I'll drive downtown to the grocery store.""
Well.. I didn't look up, Just nodded OK and asked her to
Hand me an ashtray
And when she did, I reached over and squeezed
Her hand, And then she left
And I shuttered a minute
At the thought of my world without her in it
And I reassuringly sought the touch
Of my wedding band

Well.. I musta been dozing
Cuz I didn't hear the door
And I thought now that's strange
I've never done that before
But I looked up, And she was standing by my chair
""Kinda snucked in on me"" I said
And she smiled and nodded her head
And I told her that she looked just like an angel
Standing there
For a long moment she didn't say a thing
And then she caressed her gold wedding ring
And I thought I saw a tear drop in her eye
""Honey, You'll never know how much I love you""
She said
And I thought of the many years that we had been wed
As I told her that no one could be as happy as I
And then the strangest feeling filled the room
Not one of happiness but one of gloom
And for the first time in my life, I saw sadness in her face
I reached out to touch her, and she drew away
And she told be again, That ours was a love..
That time could never erase
And then I thought I heard a thousand voices singing
But I realized it was the telephone ringing
And that's when I saw the halo
Surround her pretty golden hair
I turned trembling to the reciever and heard a cold voice
Say there had been a wreck out on the highway
And I knew that when I looked back, She wouldn't be there
Because it was an angels way of saying our last goodbye",country

Way out in the middle of Texas

Whilst his followers dined on rice
He was a low down freaky swammy?
With a heart twice as cold as ice
Heart twice as cold as ice
Laid up in dark in a crowded room
Where is wife?
Tell all the young girls he could touch their souls
And he could touch their smooth tight skin
Parents turned a blind eye
Left their children in his holy care
While their daughter were being mistreated
They just prayed and stayed unaware
They prayed and they stayed unaware
Finally somebody called the police
They took him away in chains
Convicted of child molestation

Flowers in his hair

Laying on a mountain high
Wearing some dirty filthy [?] city get up

The vibrations went dead
With these terrible songs on a rainy day

And all these things goin' on in my head

I’m not waiting for your ignorance
The way you walk and talk and live your life in bliss
And if you think that makes you innocent
You’re not right

Nothing’s wrong, isn’t it odd, you’re the only one who’s not
Frustrated, aggravated, shit it seems that you forgot
That you’re not an angel a stranger to good
But you act as if you’re innocent, I think you really should
Check reality, I know you’re not delusional
But your actions continue to dictate this conclusion all
Smiles when the world is crumbling down
When you know you caused the frowns
But you switch the blame around and you’re the victim I can count
On it, your basis fount on fabrication
Of truth so uncouth responsibility evasion
Creating this frustration, you lowering the morals
You wouldn't fight for me, but for you I’d go to world wars
My heart is sorer then when I met you desensitized
By injustice, I see the evil looming in your eyes
Tear-less cries, heart aches, pain is so demanding
I can’t grasps your reckless ways or your lack of understanding

I’m not waiting for the tears to fall, saw it but you pay no mind
If it’s not bout you, you’re the first to turn an eye that’s blind
All that I’m to you is just another voice complaining
When you brought me the cries, locked all this pain in
What goes through your brain when, you disregard the truth
Is it insanity, you stay denying even with proof
Never knew a devil could have a face like that
Just a beautiful liar, the dreams you set on fire
This distrust you breed inside ya, make the hold world feel your wrath
When you stabbing backs in mass you’re the only one who laughs
How do you forget the past, when all you are is what became of it
How do you sleep at night, in your dreams do you take the blame for shit
This anger that you cause, make me pause and wonder why I deal
With the villain I depart, but can’t help wonder how you feel

That the chick that I was talking to was actually a clone

Basically my ex girl was a catfish
Saw that I was buzzing trying to boost up her status
I’m a bad boy
Heart filled with blackness
Took her to the bedroom punched through the mattress-

-begging me take her back
Gave her such a heart attack
Promising to change but I know she don't mean none of that
I dominate the bedroom go ahead and feel my wrath
She’s a narcissistic brat I must be a psychopath!

Hook
She's so crazy so am I
Lows so low the highs so high
Scratch your back if you scratch mine
I will not be your white knight

Verse 2:
She got me sick as hell, tried to break her spell
Missed so much work I could not excel
She was banking on the fact I did not feel well
Got me hoping and praying that she doesn’t kiss n tell

Thinking bout, the moral dilemma that I was happy with my music right before I met her
Now I feel abusive
Because I had to put my 30 days notice after getting so sick but she's looking for exclusive
And she helping me to eat when I been starving
How could I release her inner demons?
People watching
Should I feel responsible for secrets I been dropping
Or do I have the right speak on issues that were shocking

Every time I try to leave she gets violent
Just like before she will start a riot
She will hit kick scream such a toxic climate
Suicidal victim player Miley Cyrus wildness

Hook
She's so crazy so am I
Lows so low the highs so high
Scratch your back if you scratch mine
I will not be your white knight",rap

23,"An Important Conference Takes Place Between Mr. Pickwick

And Samuel Weller, At Which His Parent Assists—An Old Gentleman In A Snuff-Coloured Suit Arrives Unexpectedly
Mr. Pickwick was sitting alone, musing over many things, and thinking among other considerations how he could best provide for the young couple whose present unsettled condition was matter of constant regret and anxiety to him, when Mary stepped lightly into the room, and, advancing to the table, said, rather hastily—

'Oh, if you please, Sir, Samuel is downstairs, and he says may his father see you?'
'Surely,' replied Mr. Pickwick.
'Thank you, Sir,' said Mary, tripping towards the door again.
'Sam has not been here long, has he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.

'Oh, no, Sir,' replied Mary eagerly. 'He has only just come home. He is not going to ask you for any more leave, Sir, he says.'

Mary might have been conscious that she had communicated this last intelligence with more warmth than seemed actually necessary, or she might have observed the good-humoured smile with which Mr. Pickwick regarded her, when she had finished speaking. She certainly held down her head, and examined the corner of a very smart little apron, with more closeness than there appeared any absolute occasion for.

'Tell them they can come up at once, by all means,' said Mr. Pickwick.
Mary, apparently much relieved, hurried away with her message.

Mr. Pickwick took two or three turns up and down the room; and, rubbing his chin with his left hand as he did so, appeared lost in thought.

'Well, well,' said Mr. Pickwick, at length in a kind but somewhat melancholy tone, 'it is the best way in which I could reward him for his attachment and fidelity; let it be so, in Heaven's name. It is the fate of a lonely old man, that those about him should form new and different attachments and leave him. I have no right to expect that it should be otherwise with me. No, no,' added Mr. Pickwick more cheerfully, 'it would be selfish and ungrateful. I ought to be happy to have an opportunity of providing for him so well. I am. Of course I am.'
Mr. Pickwick had been so absorbed in these reflections, that a knock at the door was three or four times repeated before he heard it. Hastily seating himself, and calling up his accustomed pleasant looks, he gave the required permission, and Sam Weller entered, followed by his father.

'Glad to see you back again, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'How do you do, Mr. Weller?'
'Wery hearty, thank'ee, sir,' replied the widower; 'hope I see you well, sir.'
'Quite, I thank you,' replied Mr. Pickwick.

'I wanted to have a little bit o' conwersation with you, sir,' said Mr. Weller, 'if you could spare me five minits or so, sir.'

'Certainly,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'Sam, give your father a chair.'

'Thank'ee, Samivel, I've got a cheer here,' said Mr. Weller, bringing one forward as he spoke; 'uncommon fine day it's been, sir,' added the old gentleman, laying his hat on the floor as he sat himself down.

'Remarkably so, indeed,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'Very seasonable.'

'Seasonablest veather I ever see, sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller. Here, the old gentleman was seized with a violent fit of coughing, which, being terminated, he nodded his head and winked and made several supplicatory and threatening gestures to his son, all of which Sam Weller steadily abstained from seeing.

Mr. Pickwick, perceiving that there was some embarrassment on the old gentleman's part, affected to be engaged in cutting the leaves of a book that lay beside him, and waited patiently until Mr. Weller should arrive at the object of his visit.

'I never see sich a aggrawatin' boy as you are, Samivel,' said Mr. Weller, looking indignantly at his son; 'never in all my born days.'

'What is he doing, Mr. Weller?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.

'He von't begin, sir,' rejoined Mr. Weller; 'he knows I ain't ekal to ex-pressin' myself ven there's anythin' partickler to be done, and yet he'll stand and see me a-settin' here taking up your walable time, and makin' a reg'lar spectacle o' myself, rayther than help me out vith a syllable. It ain't filial conduct, Samivel,' said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead; 'wery far from it.'

'You said you'd speak,' replied Sam; 'how should I know you wos done up at the wery beginnin'?'
'You might ha' seen I warn't able to start,' rejoined his father; 'I'm on the wrong side of the road, and backin' into the palin's, and all manner of unpleasantness, and yet you von't put out a hand to help me. I'm ashamed on you, Samivel.'

'The fact is, Sir,' said Sam, with a slight bow, 'the gov'nor's been a-drawin' his money.'
'Wery good, Samivel, wery good,' said Mr. Weller, nodding his head with a satisfied air, 'I didn't mean to speak harsh to you, Sammy. Wery good. That's the vay to begin. Come to the pint at once. Wery good indeed, Samivel.'

Mr. Weller nodded his head an extraordinary number of times, in the excess of his gratification, and waited in a listening attitude for Sam to resume his statement.
'You may sit down, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, apprehending that the interview was likely to prove rather longer than he had expected.

Sam bowed again and sat down; his father looking round, he continued—

'The gov'nor, sir, has drawn out five hundred and thirty pound.'
'Reduced counsels,' interposed Mr. Weller, senior, in an undertone.
'It don't much matter vether it's reduced counsels, or wot not,' said Sam; 'five hundred and thirty pounds is the sum, ain't it?'

'All right, Samivel,' replied Mr. Weller.

'To vich sum, he has added for the house and bisness—'

'Lease, good-vill, stock, and fixters,' interposed Mr. Weller.

'As much as makes it,' continued Sam, 'altogether, eleven hundred and eighty pound.'
'Indeed!' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I am delighted to hear it. I congratulate you, Mr. Weller, on having done so well.'

'Vait a minit, Sir,' said Mr. Weller, raising his hand in a deprecatory manner. 'Get on, Samivel.'

'This here money,' said Sam, with a little hesitation, 'he's anxious to put someveres, vere he knows it'll be safe, and I'm wery anxious too, for if he keeps it, he'll go a-lendin' it to somebody, or inwestin' property in horses, or droppin' his pocket-book down an airy, or makin' a Egyptian mummy of his-self in some vay or another.'
'Wery good, Samivel,' observed Mr. Weller, in as complacent a manner as if Sam had been passing the highest eulogiums on his prudence and foresight. 'Wery good.'

'For vich reasons,' continued Sam, plucking nervously at the brim of his hat—'for vich reasons, he's drawn it out to-day, and come here vith me to say, leastvays to offer, or in other vords—'

'To say this here,' said the elder Mr. Weller impatiently, 'that it ain't o' no use to me. I'm a-goin' to vork a coach reg'lar, and ha'n't got noveres to keep it in, unless I vos to pay the guard for takin' care on it, or to put it in vun o' the coach pockets, vich 'ud be a temptation to the insides. If you'll take care on it for me, sir, I shall be wery much obliged to you. P'raps,' said Mr. Weller, walking up to Mr. Pickwick and whispering in his ear—'p'raps it'll go a little vay towards the expenses o' that 'ere conwiction. All I say is, just you keep it till I ask you for it again.' With these words, Mr. Weller placed the pocket-book in Mr. Pickwick's hands, caught up his hat, and ran out of the room with a celerity scarcely to be expected from so corpulent a subject.

'Stop him, Sam!' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick earnestly. 'Overtake him; bring him back instantly! Mr. Weller—here—come back!'

Sam saw that his master's injunctions were not to be disobeyed; and, catching his father by the arm as he was descending the stairs, dragged him back by main force.
'My good friend,' said Mr. Pickwick, taking the old man by the hand, 'your honest confidence overpowers me.'

'I don't see no occasion for nothin' o' the kind, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller obstinately.
'I assure you, my good friend, I have more money than I can ever need; far more than a man at my age can ever live to spend,' said Mr. Pickwick.

'No man knows how much he can spend, till he tries,' observed Mr. Weller.
'Perhaps not,' replied Mr. Pickwick; 'but as I have no intention of trying any such experiments, I am not likely to come to want. I must beg you to take this back, Mr. Weller.' 'Wery well,' said Mr. Weller, with a discontented look. 'Mark my vords, Sammy, I'll do somethin' desperate vith this here property; somethin' desperate!'
'You'd better not,' replied Sam.

Mr. Weller reflected for a short time, and then, buttoning up his coat with great determination, said—

'I'll keep a pike.'
'Wot!' exclaimed Sam.

'A pike!' rejoined Mr. Weller, through his set teeth; 'I'll keep a pike. Say good-bye to your father, Samivel. I dewote the remainder of my days to a pike.'

This threat was such an awful one, and Mr. Weller, besides appearing fully resolved to carry it into execution, seemed so deeply mortified by Mr. Pickwick's refusal, that that gentleman, after a short reflection, said—

'Well, well, Mr. Weller, I will keep your money. I can do more good with it, perhaps, than you can.'

'Just the wery thing, to be sure,' said Mr. Weller, brightening up; 'o' course you can, sir.'

'Say no more about it,' said Mr. Pickwick, locking the pocket-book in his desk; 'I am heartily obliged to you, my good friend. Now sit down again. I want to ask your advice.'
The internal laughter occasioned by the triumphant success of his visit, which had convulsed not only Mr. Weller's face, but his arms, legs, and body also, during the locking up of the pocket-book, suddenly gave place to the most dignified gravity as he heard these words.

'Wait outside a few minutes, Sam, will you?' said Mr. Pickwick.
Sam immediately withdrew.

Mr. Weller looked uncommonly wise and very much amazed, when Mr. Pickwick opened the discourse by saying—

'You are not an advocate for matrimony, I think, Mr. Weller?'
Mr. Weller shook his head. He was wholly unable to speak; vague thoughts of some wicked widow having been successful in her designs on Mr. Pickwick, choked his utterance.

'Did you happen to see a young girl downstairs when you came in just now with your son?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.

'Yes. I see a young gal,' replied Mr. Weller shortly.

'What did you think of her, now? Candidly, Mr. Weller, what did you think of her?'
'I thought she wos wery plump, and vell made,' said Mr. Weller, with a critical air.
'So she is,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'so she is. What did you think of her manners, from what you saw of her?'

'Wery pleasant,' rejoined Mr. Weller. 'Wery pleasant and comformable.'
The precise meaning which Mr. Weller attached to this last-mentioned adjective, did not appear; but, as it was evident from the tone in which he used it that it was a favourable expression, Mr. Pickwick was as well satisfied as if he had been thoroughly enlightened on the subject.

'I take a great interest in her, Mr. Weller,' said Mr. Pickwick.
Mr. Weller coughed.

'I mean an interest in her doing well,' resumed Mr. Pickwick; 'a desire that she may be comfortable and prosperous. You understand?'

'Wery clearly,' replied Mr. Weller, who understood nothing yet.
'That young person,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'is attached to your son.'
'To Samivel Veller!' exclaimed the parent.
'Yes,' said Mr. Pickwick.

'It's nat'ral,' said Mr. Weller, after some consideration, 'nat'ral, but rayther alarmin'. Sammy must be careful.'

'How do you mean?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.
'Wery careful that he don't say nothin' to her,' responded Mr. Weller. 'Wery careful that he ain't led avay, in a innocent moment, to say anythin' as may lead to a conwiction for breach. You're never safe vith 'em, Mr. Pickwick, ven they vunce has designs on you; there's no knowin' vere to have 'em; and vile you're a-considering of it, they have you. I wos married fust, that vay myself, Sir, and Sammy wos the consekens o' the manoover.'

'You give me no great encouragement to conclude what I have to say,' observed Mr. Pickwick, 'but I had better do so at once. This young person is not only attached to your son, Mr. Weller, but your son is attached to her.'

'Vell,' said Mr. Weller, 'this here's a pretty sort o' thing to come to a father's ears, this is!'

'I have observed them on several occasions,' said Mr. Pickwick, making no comment on Mr. Weller's last remark; 'and entertain no doubt at all about it. Supposing I were desirous of establishing them comfortably as man and wife in some little business or situation, where they might hope to obtain a decent living, what should you think of it, Mr. Weller?'

At first, Mr. Weller received with wry faces a proposition involving the marriage of anybody in whom he took an interest; but, as Mr. Pickwick argued the point with him, and laid great stress on the fact that Mary was not a widow, he gradually became more tractable. Mr. Pickwick had great influence over him, and he had been much struck with Mary's appearance; having, in fact, bestowed several very unfatherly winks upon her, already. At length he said that it was not for him to oppose Mr. Pickwick's inclination, and that he would be very happy to yield to his advice; upon which, Mr. Pickwick joyfully took him at his word, and called Sam back into the room.

'Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, clearing his throat, 'your father and I have been having some conversation about you.'

'About you, Samivel,' said Mr. Weller, in a patronising and impressive voice.
'I am not so blind, Sam, as not to have seen, a long time since, that you entertain something more than a friendly feeling towards Mrs. Winkle's maid,' said Mr. Pickwick.
'You hear this, Samivel?' said Mr. Weller, in the same judicial form of speech as before.

'I hope, Sir,' said Sam, addressing his master, 'I hope there's no harm in a young man takin' notice of a young 'ooman as is undeniably good-looking and well-conducted.'
'Certainly not,' said Mr. Pickwick.

'Not by no means,' acquiesced Mr. Weller, affably but magisterially.
'So far from thinking there is anything wrong in conduct so natural,' resumed Mr. Pickwick, 'it is my wish to assist and promote your wishes in this respect. With this view, I have had a little conversation with your father; and finding that he is of my opinion—'

'The lady not bein' a widder,' interposed Mr. Weller in explanation.

'The lady not being a widow,' said Mr. Pickwick, smiling. 'I wish to free you from the restraint which your present position imposes upon you, and to mark my sense of your fidelity and many excellent qualities, by enabling you to marry this girl at once, and to earn an independent livelihood for yourself and family. I shall be proud, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, whose voice had faltered a little hitherto, but now resumed its customary tone, 'proud and happy to make your future prospects in life my grateful and peculiar care.'

There was a profound silence for a short time, and then Sam said, in a low, husky sort of voice, but firmly withal—

'I'm very much obliged to you for your goodness, Sir, as is only like yourself; but it can't be done.'

'Can't be done!' ejaculated Mr. Pickwick in astonishment.
'Samivel!' said Mr. Weller, with dignity.

'I say it can't be done,' repeated Sam in a louder key. 'Wot's to become of you, Sir?'
'My good fellow,' replied Mr. Pickwick, 'the recent changes among my friends will alter my mode of life in future, entirely; besides, I am growing older, and want repose and quiet. My rambles, Sam, are over.'

'How do I know that 'ere, sir?' argued Sam. 'You think so now! S'pose you wos to change your mind, vich is not unlikely, for you've the spirit o' five-and-twenty in you still, what 'ud become on you vithout me? It can't be done, Sir, it can't be done.'
'Wery good, Samivel, there's a good deal in that,' said Mr. Weller encouragingly.
'I speak after long deliberation, Sam, and with the certainty that I shall keep my word,' said Mr. Pickwick, shaking his head. 'New scenes have closed upon me; my rambles are at an end.'

'Wery good,' rejoined Sam. 'Then, that's the wery best reason wy you should alvays have somebody by you as understands you, to keep you up and make you comfortable. If you vant a more polished sort o' feller, vell and good, have him; but vages or no vages, notice or no notice, board or no board, lodgin' or no lodgin', Sam Veller, as you took from the old inn in the Borough, sticks by you, come what may; and let ev'rythin' and ev'rybody do their wery fiercest, nothin' shall ever perwent it!'

At the close of this declaration, which Sam made with great emotion, the elder Mr. Weller rose from his chair, and, forgetting all considerations of time, place, or propriety, waved his hat above his head, and gave three vehement cheers.

'My good fellow,' said Mr. Pickwick, when Mr. Weller had sat down again, rather abashed at his own enthusiasm, 'you are bound to consider the young woman also.'
'I do consider the young 'ooman, Sir,' said Sam. 'I have considered the young 'ooman. I've spoke to her. I've told her how I'm sitivated; she's ready to vait till I'm ready, and I believe she vill. If she don't, she's not the young 'ooman I take her for, and I give her up vith readiness. You've know'd me afore, Sir. My mind's made up, and nothin' can ever alter it.'

Who could combat this resolution? Not Mr. Pickwick. He derived, at that moment, more pride and luxury of feeling from the disinterested attachment of his humble friends, than ten thousand protestations from the greatest men living could have awakened in his heart.

While this conversation was passing in Mr. Pickwick's room, a little old gentleman in a suit of snuff-coloured clothes, followed by a porter carrying a small portmanteau, presented himself below; and, after securing a bed for the night, inquired of the waiter whether one Mrs. Winkle was staying there, to which question the waiter of course responded in the affirmative.

'Is she alone?' inquired the old gentleman.
'I believe she is, Sir,' replied the waiter; 'I can call her own maid, Sir, if you—'
'No, I don't want her,' said the old gentleman quickly. 'Show me to her room without announcing me.'

'Eh, Sir?' said the waiter.
'Are you deaf?' inquired the little old gentleman.
'No, sir.'
'Then listen, if you please. Can you hear me now?'
'Yes, Sir.'

'That's well. Show me to Mrs. Winkle's room, without announcing me.'
As the little old gentleman uttered this command, he slipped five shillings into the waiter's hand, and looked steadily at him.

'Really, sir,' said the waiter, 'I don't know, sir, whether—'

'Ah! you'll do it, I see,' said the little old gentleman. 'You had better do it at once. It will save time.'

There was something so very cool and collected in the gentleman's manner, that the waiter put the five shillings in his pocket, and led him upstairs without another word.
'This is the room, is it?' said the gentleman. 'You may go.' The waiter complied, wondering much who the gentleman could be, and what he wanted; the little old gentleman, waiting till he was out of sight, tapped at the door.
'Come in,' said Arabella.

'Um, a pretty voice, at any rate,' murmured the little old gentleman; 'but that's nothing.' As he said this, he opened the door and walked in. Arabella, who was sitting at work, rose on beholding a stranger—a little confused—but by no means ungracefully so.

'Pray don't rise, ma'am,' said the unknown, walking in, and closing the door after him. 'Mrs. Winkle, I believe?'

Arabella inclined her head.
'Mrs. Nathaniel Winkle, who married the son of the old man at Birmingham?' said the stranger, eyeing Arabella with visible curiosity.

Again Arabella inclined her head, and looked uneasily round, as if uncertain whether to call for assistance.

'I surprise you, I see, ma'am,' said the old gentleman.
'Rather, I confess,' replied Arabella, wondering more and more.
'I'll take a chair, if you'll allow me, ma'am,' said the stranger.
He took one; and drawing a spectacle-case from his pocket, leisurely pulled out a pair of spectacles, which he adjusted on his nose.

'You don't know me, ma'am?' he said, looking so intently at Arabella that she began to feel alarmed.

'No, sir,' she replied timidly.

'No,' said the gentleman, nursing his left leg; 'I don't know how you should. You know my name, though, ma'am.'

'Do I?' said Arabella, trembling, though she scarcely knew why. 'May I ask what it is?'

'Presently, ma'am, presently,' said the stranger, not having yet removed his eyes from her countenance. 'You have been recently married, ma'am?'

'I have,' replied Arabella, in a scarcely audible tone, laying aside her work, and becoming greatly agitated as a thought, that had occurred to her before, struck more forcibly upon her mind.

'Without having represented to your husband the propriety of first consulting his father, on whom he is dependent, I think?' said the stranger.
Arabella applied her handkerchief to her eyes.

'Without an endeavour, even, to ascertain, by some indirect appeal, what were the old man's sentiments on a point in which he would naturally feel much interested?' said the stranger.

'I cannot deny it, Sir,' said Arabella.
'And without having sufficient property of your own to afford your husband any permanent assistance in exchange for the worldly advantages which you knew he would have gained if he had married agreeably to his father's wishes?' said the old gentleman. 'This is what boys and girls call disinterested affection, till they have boys and girls of their own, and then they see it in a rougher and very different light!'

Arabella's tears flowed fast, as she pleaded in extenuation that she was young and inexperienced; that her attachment had alone induced her to take the step to which she had resorted; and that she had been deprived of the counsel and guidance of her parents almost from infancy.

'It was wrong,' said the old gentleman in a milder tone, 'very wrong. It was romantic, unbusinesslike, foolish.'

'It was my fault; all my fault, Sir,' replied poor Arabella, weeping.
'Nonsense,' said the old gentleman; 'it was not your fault that he fell in love with you, I suppose? Yes it was, though,' said the old gentleman, looking rather slily at Arabella. 'It was your fault. He couldn't help it.'

This little compliment, or the little gentleman's odd way of paying it, or his altered manner—so much kinder than it was, at first—or all three together, forced a smile from Arabella in the midst of her tears.

'Where's your husband?' inquired the old gentleman, abruptly; stopping a smile which was just coming over his own face.

'I expect him every instant, sir,' said Arabella. 'I persuaded him to take a walk this morning. He is very low and wretched at not having heard from his father.'
'Low, is he?' said the old gentlemen. 'Serve him right!'

'He feels it on my account, I am afraid,' said Arabella; 'and indeed, Sir, I feel it deeply on his. I have been the sole means of bringing him to his present condition.'
'Don't mind it on his account, my dear,' said the old gentleman. 'It serves him right. I am glad of it—actually glad of it, as far as he is concerned.'

The words were scarcely out of the old gentleman's lips, when footsteps were heard ascending the stairs, which he and Arabella seemed both to recognise at the same moment. The little gentleman turned pale; and, making a strong effort to appear composed, stood up, as Mr. Winkle entered the room.

'Father!' cried Mr. Winkle, recoiling in amazement.
'Yes, sir,' replied the little old gentleman. 'Well, Sir, what have you got to say to me?'
Mr. Winkle remained silent.

'You are ashamed of yourself, I hope, Sir?' said the old gentleman.
Still Mr. Winkle said nothing.

'Are you ashamed of yourself, Sir, or are you not?' inquired the old gentleman.
'No, Sir,' replied Mr. Winkle, drawing Arabella's arm through his. 'I am not ashamed of myself, or of my wife either.'

'Upon my word!' cried the old gentleman ironically.
'I am very sorry to have done anything which has lessened your affection for me, Sir,' said Mr. Winkle; 'but I will say, at the same time, that I have no reason to be ashamed of having this lady for my wife, nor you of having her for a daughter.'

'Give me your hand, Nat,' said the old gentleman, in an altered voice. 'Kiss me, my love. You are a very charming little daughter-in-law after all!'
In a few minutes' time Mr. Winkle went in search of Mr. Pickwick, and returning with that gentleman, presented him to his father, whereupon they shook hands for five minutes incessantly.

'Mr. Pickwick, I thank you most heartily for all your kindness to my son,' said old Mr. Winkle, in a bluff, straightforward way. 'I am a hasty fellow, and when I saw you last, I was vexed and taken by surprise. I have judged for myself now, and am more than satisfied. Shall I make any more apologies, Mr. Pickwick?'

'Not one,' replied that gentleman. 'You have done the only thing wanting to complete my happiness.'

Hereupon there was another shaking of hands for five minutes longer, accompanied by a great number of complimentary speeches, which, besides being complimentary, had the additional and very novel recommendation of being sincere.

Sam had dutifully seen his father to the Belle Sauvage, when, on returning, he encountered the fat boy in the court, who had been charged with the delivery of a note from Emily Wardle.

'I say,' said Joe, who was unusually loquacious, 'what a pretty girl Mary is, isn't she? I am SO fond of her, I am!'

Mr. Weller made no verbal remark in reply; but eyeing the fat boy for a moment, quite transfixed at his presumption, led him by the collar to the corner, and dismissed him with a harmless but ceremonious kick. After which, he walked home, whistling.",misc

To lead you in the summer to join the black parade...""

On certain type of days I don't be doing much
Grab me some weed a lighter, and grab me Dutch
Don't come around with your drama please n- hush
I'm always making moves, so I'm always in a rush
Self made by the age of 16
Getting dirty money but I'm always looking clean
Some say I'm cool, others say I'm a nobody
They just mad cause spending money is my hobby
I do what I want whenever I like, I stay getting cake
Broke niggas looking like they could use a bite
I got my money right, I got my money right
Incase you didn't hear it I had to say it twice
Got my own apartment, I got my own car
I even got a motorcycle, I'm a TrapStar
I even got a lawyer incase I get in trouble
Whenever there's a drought my price always double
Yeah, I'm an entrepreneur
You're at your house jacking off you're a loser
Same shit different day I'm trying to get richer
Pushing work at the trap do you get the picture?
Hook:
Do do do you get the picture? do do do you get the picture? Get get get the picture! ( ha ha ) (ha ha) Trap trap trap trap trap trapstar ( say what ?) Trap trap trap trap trap trapstar, do you get the picture? Do do do you get the picture?? (2x)

Verse 2:

It's not hard to tell who's real and who's fake
I write my own rhymes so don't compare me to Drake
Even when I'm going through it I still got faith
Shoutout to any of my haters have a beautiful day (ayy)
Nothing is free
Chilling in the suburb with my friends smoking weed
Getting so much paper need a money machine
#DoYouGetThePicture I'm the #AmericanDream
I speak Spanish, hasta manana
Dime que lo que, mi casa es tu casa
I'm Dominican, shoutout to my Haitians
This rap game needs change I guess I gotta be patient

Hook: (2x)

Verse 3:

Another day another dollar
I don't do McDonalds, bitch I eat lobster
I lift a lot of weight but I don't work out
Ever since I took over I've never seen a drought
Squares in your circle, that's a waffle
I don't wanna listen to your song your shit is awful
They say I'm finna blow next, I got potential
You the type to rap over a tagged instrumental
Please, don't make me embarrass you
You the type to jump out of plane without a parachute
And your teeth are yellow like Peek a sho
Why you always broke? It's a mystery like Scooby Doo

Fuck all the lies we live in a new hour
We stand in two different worlds it's true power

You intrigued with the shine let you tackle with your lies
Demons in your eyes can't break you from your hide

The stars look dim when the sun god near
When almighty come I can't ever stand in fear

I hold divine right I never stand up in yo line
They packing up the club I'm held up in the synagogue
And the only fans gods
Reading scriptures from the cerebellum
Living what I mean yo lies
Hoping these n*ggas fed from the dark and you are what you eat
And you hide by all your loses
But I channel what I have through the spells that I speak
I reign over all

On a hill made of the organs of the kids in your warehouses
And still the men in power gorgin' bids for corruption
Disgustin'! Ain't no one gonna step in? I'm an eruption
And my anger when I see images of more gore is on you!
Feel the horror as I peel away your skin, those in view spew bleu
Now you are what you do, poetic justice pulled through

[Chorus]
Social justice, race, rape, girls, boys, hate
Perfect storm for a collapse, maybe now it's just too late
I'm angry at the people and I just want them to learn
Sometimes the only way to build is to burn

[Outro]
Escape through the back into a Pontiac
Snagged the keys off the hacked chest of a hypochondriac
He agonized over the flak that's ruinin' his outfit
But luckily he was dead too soon to care about it
Swerving down the street with thirty cops behind me
Curving round the seat to take a shot behind me
Shoulda kept my eyes up - hot turn on the asphalt
Coulda then I capsize",rap

I open my heart

Standing tall through it all

Fuck that I got whiskey, let's mix this shit from the east to the south
Now my friends lay me down to sleep
A fifth of whiskey down by my feet
If I should die before I wake
Tell everyone that I drank it straight
Just another night in the lone star state

Hazardous, the catalyst for damaging the glamorous, the pacifists are acting shit, can't pass to match the manuscript
Medusa dropping on ya, stone to show off my persona, acoustic nuisance with aloofness to medulla oblongata got ta
Go, down to Nevada, tomorrow, find John Connor and blow his brains like propane, Kurt Cobain from Nirvana
I go for beef like piranha, kabana, proper its Sparta , but part of its art, you smell my fucking farts in the dark it's an honor
Horribly the odyssey, is hard to see iconicly, because Socrates philosophies get lost in lost commodities
And honestly, I drop on beats like nuclear economies; apologies are served when the verse is burnt in third degrees
Absurdity is circling concerning certain stern Mcs, and mercifully I'll murder thee faster than burb infirmaries
Refer to me as King, (bling) ...working for eternity, and burn a weed to supersede my curse is slowly surfacing
A Circus freak, you’ve heard of me? Certainly, I serve defeat, and learn to murder meat when I yearn to turn you vertically
Persecute the words to speak, and turn the key for burglary, you need to steal some solar flare, I'm hot like fuckin Mercury
Casual, rapping erratic, tragic and acting ill, facts are still wack Jack, you’re fragile as a daffodil
Man will kill, many men, many fucking many men, beheading in a sentence to send em’ off of their present tense
Innocence, is in its sense, in its own fucking inner sense, because it depends on what your sense spends on all its messages
A pessimist confess to this that life is never endless in the sense that residents keep coming like my fucking rent is kid
Ever since my pencil grip was tighter then my next to Kin, I've caught easy money, like a honey up in Centerlink
Your best to think my metaphors will better yours and mess your think, I'll walk into a cop house with a boar and I'll arrest a pig
Censorship, should sail its ship to a place of blatant negligence, because in defensive, it's fake like the fake in Katy Perry’s breasts
Laid to rest, hex every parade of plague plagiarists, because I ain't pacing boy, I'll run you down like a train descends
I’m a rapper in success, and you’re rabbit in suspense, you think you’re big bwoy now because you’re nappy with the dreads
You can slap me till I'm dead, fuck, I'm happy that it's said, you can’t buy a man’s respect when you sell out for the bread
Eat a pus, hide your fucking eyes like you’re Oedipus, it's leads to this, can you play the notes like a pianist
Egotist, feeds with the head of a penis (pen-a-nus), bleed to this, blood brothers unite in decree of it
Seize the seas like Caesar I’m seeing facetious in physique, fiends in me, I flip a hit to feed my upper scenery
See the dream, birds eye perspective in a record, the way flip my letters word is bond its esoteric
Hip hop is in a rut that is resurrected from the consumer who consumed its future like a vulture chewing at its wound
You sucked the fucking life out of the potential of the game, when your expectations placed chains and fame, over pain
Know the name, Novocain, motherfuckers all numbing out the pain, like a moth to a flame you endange your own life
Reconnaissance is prosperous, anonymously ominous, like Artemis I’m on point, asking me obviously
An act to show retardedness, I'm in the air like I'm phosphorus, the consequence of hollow tips, is infamous like Swastika’s
Insanity is leaking and I'm actively repeating when I wrap it and I breathe in, fucking gravity is leaving and
You're rapidly depleting, while these caskets are increasing, got you passively agreeing, that its anarchy I'm breathing

Rotten in the broken shack
Try to fight it, bones will crack
Trapped inside my woods
You bitch, you bitch, you never make it back
It don't even matter
There's no trace of you within past
Only remnants of your body
Is the tape on play-back
Hunnid years back in the past
Holding out them blood pacts
Next fucking winter
There gon' be another blood bath
Take it as you want it
But your vision is just simply black
Face the facts
'Cause I know your family jus' ain't doin'  that

You a tourist? You can walk into my forest
Ya sister went missing 'cause I ate her fuckin' organs
Into witchcraft, so I turned her into porridge
Break a stick, I'll hear you walk, I'll find you in the morning
When its midnight, I'll fuckin' slump you while recording
Take you where your friends are motherfuckin' stored in
Inside a box, inside my freezer
This is murder, this ain't a misdemeanor
In my own realm, cause I fuckin' bend reality
Switch through dimensions when I'm tearing through your gravity
Anatomy, take ya fuckin' mouth out if you laugh at me
I turn you into void because I fuckin' snap trees
At your spine, I turn you into dust
I kill a generation and I don't really give a fuck
Black energy wanna run me up, like huh?
Everything getting blurry, can't you see me bruh?

I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy
I have the control because I'll erase your fuckin' memory

I'm the Blair fuckin' Witch, I could turn your life around
Keep you in my forest and I'll keep you on the ground
You are nothing but my slave, to my black fuckin' energy

Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—

You the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
You ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas?
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed""

3651,"[Verse 1]
Jacked up just the other week
To the loss of an oxblood velour tie
And a Handmaiden DVD
And some condoms the midden
Wouldn’t even fit in, yet
If he’d run me through
I’d have been in his eternal debt, albeit briefly
Tape-handled blade, its wielder scared pissless
Past townhoused rows he ran, to the neighbouring estate
And there I stood alone, absent of any cavalry
Death having proved so reluctant to me;
Not for mе to be a gallowing undertaker’s day’s David
Oh that lifе should always be so exciting, so profuse
With such meaningful communion, and mind
Always have cause to run amok with thoughts like purchased
Soldiers, barely a single worthy shirt among ‘em
Save me trying to make like a man
Whose brain contains only maids in habitation
Thinking how their languor might be enriched;
For in my room which, though
Its T is V’d, I’ve learned to heat without gas
I’ve long since failed to meter if my isolation
Was bought, or is my gift;
And if it is my genius, then such genius
Is also a plague, borne by surfboard on the sea
Spread like to those estatees whom
Surround me so completely
[Chorus]
And how’s that for tragedy
All those thousands around
And still, no one but me?
And the crowd goes mild

[Verse 2]
I hear their words they themselves know not
They speak: “Look at him go
He’s not a boy, he’s not a man
He is something that he’ll never understand.”
Time’s as tough as the dark beasts’ hide
That graze as novas gaze on these silicate fields
Between suited second gen Ghaneans, and what look
Like shepherds, ain’t got no interest in sheep, but that
Those sheep be exploited labour, fit for Peep’s reap;
All history’s taken for nostalgia here
Raw ore to be refined in timelines belching toxins to the sky
And in such a locale I can have no hope, merely will
And yet shuffle I by the factory, as though I had the former even still
Dark as my spirit may be
Still I am happy
If queer I seem to you
Imagine how queer I seem to me; and how queer seem
All these elaborate philosophies they
Build to excuse their discontent
Their art be designed only
For the victory of the party;
They have no joy in values as lived
No warmth of thought for ordinary mortals
And in seeking in vain to seem so rare
They prove the most ordinary of them all
I’d be following their only value to concede I’m guilty of that too
But, though no one else has proof, that’s not true; and what is true
Well, that is all I have, which I once guarded jealously
But which now I wish to share with you. If I seem
Too eager to humble the pride, observe if you would
That there are many worse faults, and that as you bid curricula decolonise
And cultures ghettoise, you do so via devices
Whose barcode is Uyghur prison bars, their blood the price’s ink
And who cares? I can only believe, no one but me;
No wonder I am, time to time, found hard to receive
I was derived with unique purity from memories
Such as cannot be lived with, only transcended, or
Otherwise made plantation; a world laid in
Invisibility by the touch of light, so
Only with eyes closed
Does my self come into view
It’s both a truth, for my generation
And the curse it will gift to the world

[Verse 3]
In those casks where memory is housed
And occasionally brought to task
The contents mellow to a richness far
Removed from the moment they concern
And experiencing this wine, all the richer with time
We cry “Man, to but have that time once again!”
When in fact, to pass it cross tongue that’s tasted much interim
It would not taste so rich
I can take no pleasure in what is, merely what was
That isolation’s not gift, but sentence; so give me
A keg of past’s grammar and let me drown myself standing up
And that’s what happens when you’re
A human archetype destined for immortality;
Among all the ruin sowed is left
No one but me, and so, hell, and hell only
Perhaps back’s the beast of old, the feel of
Its fur’s sure familiar; it’s heaving in breath
Perhaps in anger of the trophy hide I skinned
From its mate, which now I sport me gainst August cold
That hide, and these faux Flu-12s, for carriage bifurcated
And the tunes by which I’m ferried, hidden, and exlocated
The heat of a song, so outrageous
That it turned my brain matter to glass
My every thought, clear, too clear to recognise
For the first time
I woke up to find some kids using
My ears as a telescope",rap

I'm Krvd the one called mentally deceased
If you like violence
I invite you to my audience
And if you want a psycho on your beats
Call me I can do it for free, bitch
Indeed
It's satisfying to see
All my enemies
Relapse and looking exhausting
And for a little while they will have a transitory
Motherfuckin recovery
I swallow
Their claret
I feel a hollow
In it
For me it's not morbid
For them my spittle, my saliva
Is a like a fucking lava
My words are whips
When they collide their ears
It's harrowing to be hated by me
No lie, fucking honestly
I still got this insanity
It's crazy
Like me
I'm zany
Got my shades on my back
I am a shady man
[Verse 2]
My beautiful dark sempiternal lunacy
Is the reason why I'm mentally deceased
According to the people that really know me
I am so fucking dreary
Panic when they see me
Fright when they feel me
Feel me, closely
Till they feel my breath, coldly
That's just me when I follow him
In every motherfucking place, yeah
My threats
Can make people fear
Now to keep things legit
I am a creation
Of my Great God and I say it out loud
Cause I'm so proud
Now I imagine if he wants to punish
Don't you think it will be lavish?
If a creation makes horrifying things
What can his creator do as a punishment?
If y'all knew how hell looks like for real
Y'all be screaming out of fear until
You've got no more voice
And start praying like if it was your only choice
To continue living
But you'll be so terrified
You'll be praying hard
And hit your head with the floor
Until you bleed and have a red forehead bro
[Verse 3]
I am Dracula with a raven
On my shoulder
He's my messenger
I am dark but I hate Satan
I'm so rare like solar eclipse
This ain't a hyperbole it's realistic
Trust me
I will keep your secrets
Hurt me
I will destroy you and make you bleed all your claret
Behead behead behead
Axes axes in the middle of their heads
The scene is in an abandoned church
This scene is in abandoned Kurk
Make me cry?
Only when a loved one dies
Go at them
I will bury your mom and dad
Keep raping with that boom trap
Lit motherfucking beat rap
Self-Made since my youngest days
My name is Kandy
But I ain't sweet
At all
[Verse 4]
Fuck y'all
Fuck the world
Fuck being normal
Everybody's going stupid lately
Medias showing things it makes injuries
There's a lot of fucking injustice
They beheaded 2 Scandinavians
It's so fucking horrible
Shoot in 45 muslims in New Zealand
Doesn't make the same noise at all
Racism has no nation
Terrorism has no religion
Y'all be going crazy as fuck
For the other folks
Fuck islamophobia
Fuck xenophobia
To hell with it
For fucking real
Throw at these motherfuckers knifes
They deserve to die
The way we think
Make them mad
The way we think
Make them want to shut us down so bad
Expect resistance
When you disrespect existence

We don't want no condolences

Opp's really messed up and wanted to have a piece

(Chorus)
Now i have to make money blow up and make bands
Right now people poppin' off pills and xan's
Soon when i blow up haters will say they are fans
Wait til' they know me i know that i will have stan's
Hop out the wrathe and into the benz'
Haters in school will say they knew me and were my friends
My song will blow up and get on the trends
Counting up money like it 50 from 10's",rap

Lately, I don't feel the same

The fact that you're gone has left me feeling alone

Replace the memory of you with bags of Louis Vuitton

Someday babe
Let me know let me know someday how you are

I'm forgеtting as the seasons change
You used to be the one
You used to be
I don't wanna tell the truth

Caught a fleeting glimpse
Now I see the truth
I'm in the past
The summer flew by in a flash
Backtrack to the times outside
Take me back

On my own with this
Who's coming with me, I don't really know
Looked up to me, now I know they don't
What's up with me, I could really show you
She said for a west end Leb you seem like a good guy
Truth is you give me one good night
All you'll get is one good bye
Hold it down was once my style, where'd my mind go?
I dunno
Said I'd never try what I'm high on
But I'm just dying for a quiet home
My brain is too big to be caged in a basement
Stuck on my dreams I can't chase a replacement
I guess I'll just face it when my time is wasted, wasted
Past moments of greatness they all feel so ancient, ancient
They tell me be patient but I know that patience
Won't change it
I can't show them patience in place of amazement
Unless I fake it, and I'm not with the fakeness I swear
I could lost in this music like mazes
My life would feel useless if I choose to waste it
Fuck up to me knees, I'm in up to my waist
I'll eat supper next week if I suffer today
I don't need to fit in to silence these critics
I sleep at night in despite of these crickets
They have strength in digits, like flee's and I'm itchin' to kill 'em
But you take one down and there's always two to fill in
That's real, is there a big enough meal to keep a man like me filled?
To keep a man like me still
It's gunna take a girl cold enough that could make me chill
Make me feel I should pray at each meal
That she doesn't do some that could break my will
But right now I'm closed down
Come with me I could should you how it goes down
Let her know I got calls on hold now
Cuz I don't really wanna hear from that old crowd
Don't wanna feel like my soul sold out
Do this on my own I was never shown how
Anytime I spoke out, I was shown doubt
Respond to loose lips with a closed mouth
Try to go the same way as Kanye but every time I try it just goes south
(Hold up, I'm not done yet, I'm not done)

Don't let you commitment be limited by their assistance
I swear they'll feel jealous even if it's just for an instant
Don't hate me for sounding too zealous, not one word was written, yeah
I know that I sound so revamped, but I wasn't bitten, uh
When I'm on this mission, trippin', thinkin' 'bout if I'll be in Edmonton
Next winter, frost bitten
Up at 6, pitch dark, still getting it
Roads bad, cars plugged in for the ignition
But I swear that we're all so gifted

I have some very sad news for all of you
And I think ah sad news for all our fellow citizens
The people who love peace all over the world
And that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed in Memphis TN

I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all

I have a dream that one day
This nation will rise up
Live out the true meaning of it's creed
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal

Dream with me now
Brutalize every law, revolutionize them all
I'll say it once, reread, memorize, and rewind
I give thought to the blind, my thoughts stick in the mind
I express my right to say when I feel it's time
But it's all in my mind, you can interpret it as
I say it's wrong and they say it's right and I'ma be the last
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A man who had, a dream died with a hateful past
A man who head was blown off from the unknown blast
Or the man who told us not to hate yourself
And saying this, perhaps I should shhh fore I regret it
Robert, who helped us with a few more civil rights
Who had been through a few obstacles shot his way the last half
These men are popularized in our past
Now here's pay back, I'm gon show them that
Fuck United man, yeah I snap back

Come along, follow we, as we lead through the free
As we provide just enough people that we need

We gon charge, we gon stomp, we gon march through the swamp
We gon fight through the hate, take us right through the heavens

VERSE 02:
We got people marching up north, on the west and the southern middle
Come together let's all form, and bark just a little
Just let it gradually build, from the first to the last
All we need is a sea of people, some white and most black
Race doesn't matter we will fight them all as we're gathered together
To celebrate for the cause no matter the color
If we bleed, let them bleed, yeah the redder the better
They ain't gon stop us they won't, we're stronger now more than ever

To tell us somethin maybe it's Martin just
Saying we're responsible, for these imposers
This coward that we have empowered, who is this Bin Laden
We shake our head and nodin – how can, we allow
Our freedom die like this without, us pumpin our fist now
This will be our, final debate
Let me, be the voice, and the strength, and the choice
Let me make enough noise to make these people hate this country
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by seven-teen
Million people all equal at this high point
Maybe we can reach these racists through my voice
Let this government answer a higher anarchy
Shoot me in the very light of day, let me go
Fight this war, let me impress them that way
No more blood on police, we got our own battles
To fight in our own hoods, no more fake justice
To make us thinking marching is helping
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
Look in my eyes this country is all lies
Us Americans we serve for the stars and the stripes but they have been swiped
Washed and wiped out, we replace the country with a face

This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease

Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save

'Til on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost it's grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

On Christ the solid rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me

From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

Most times I cry

Hows everybody feline tonight? Mozig on the mic!
Am I the only one that thinks Stroodles looks like a dike?
I’m allowed to say nigga, nigga, cuz im a black cat
I can rhyme in purrfect English like I’m The Cat in the Hat
I'm a bad ass cat I hide under the bed and play with rolled up socks
Plus my mouth is super dirty like a fucking litter box
Other cats treat me as their king like we live in Great Britain
As soon as you see my puckered ass like kitten mittens you'll be smitten
I'm so horny like a cat in heat man my kitty dick is hard like concrete
I’m going to go find some stray off the street so I can go skeet skeet
I got my main man Diego J. That T-FLock bitch is definitely gay
I hope you pussys are ready for some hot word play
I like to go to cat clubs and get high on cat nip
Then I go find some slut stray and play with her cat nip
I just raped this verse like Brett Favre raped Jenn Sterger
I left you bitches hungry for more like “I can haz cheezburger?”

Meow mix meow mix
I shit them dix while I fuck them chicks
I 69'd with a cat named smalls
I got the pussy and she got my balls
She purred real nice when she saw me fuck them mice
Oh yea, I kept her on ice
Cat nip and sippin on some shit, when I see a tit, all I wanna do is finger the clit
When I do, I make sure there’s a slit, just in case I want to insert my poopy dick
They call me the cat’s meow, I run my dick from your stern to your bow
And when I eat you out im reminded of general tsao mixed with some cat chow
Black cats and nigga dick rats
All my life I pee when I sat
The big boy that stands so tall, orange cobra is the king of them all
While them other cats get in brawls, this cat sits back and plays with his balls
I've been called a pussy in the past, but if you call me that today, bitch you won’t last....
The authorities won't event have to ask, they'll see that its your dick that has been axed

[Verse 3: T-Flock]
I like my pussy like I like my men, with a throbbing cock
I always beat off into a tube sock!
I like to get bossy, fuck kittys how about doggy-
Style, I could go for miles bitch put me on trial
Slide that hot dude across the floor like a whore
Just a little rug burn, is it my turn?
I was getting into trouble with my alley cat
When the cops came up and asked “whose gat is dat?”
I said that gat be mine
“What the fuck you going to do with this feline?”
I found this one cat that had a long tail
But when she showed me her pussy I just had to bail
Foul cats scheamin up the setup
Tryin to leave me and my cream wet up
Two in the head leaded up
Call the coroners to make they bed up
[Verse 4: Jiggy Z]
I was getting horny for a raunchy kitty orgy
That pussy smelled like cat food and ruined the mood
I said fuck it make some cake farts
I tore up that frosted pussy like darts
On to the pink tacos scratch it up with whiskers
8 cat nips for ocho titty twisters
She sucked my dick all covered in bukkake
Fry that pussy in the pan like chicken teriyaki
Throw the extra jizz up in the cum dumpster
Beat that pussy up till that clit start to flutter
Fuck her in the gutter can full of tuna
Got that pussy so riled up she a puma
Box full of litter that dried shit starts to glitter
Pour a little liquor now it’s time to finger
Take a nibble on this dick and jingle my balls
And I’ll sprinkle a tinkle until it starts to tingle
Just playing bitch suck it or I’ll fuck it!

And force my head to take the blows

I’ve been trying to scratch at the surface
Can’t wrap my head around the thought that anything’s worth this
Lying alone
Except I’m not alone and there’s every where
To go
But still I’ll hit my peaks and somehow end up at my low

Break myself down the only way I know how
Neglect the notion I’m somebody else
Winter stay
Through you I can feel the same even though I’ve changed
Re-purpose the thoughts I just refrain
And Let this anxious body lay to rest

I’m confiding with the surface
Only saturate my lies enough to find another purpose
And I’ll break through doors they try to bind me to
To come around and realize that all the hinges come unscrewed, I’m bound to lose

And I’ve been running up the ends I’ll never catch
When the part of me I loved is dead
I guess that’s where this ends
When I see that part of you then I don’t know even who you are
I look at the canvas of this person from afar

It’s like I never even knew you at all
Can’t help that I’m just here to see when you fall

Why do I push my luck when it’s all on you?
Collect my empty weight and start anew
So I can’t stay

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl

You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller

[Verse 1: Bless]
Welcome to the table where the wolves and the crows eat
Write songs about the man who will grow to be
Take a seat and just fade into the daydream
Will awake but the taste it was a real thing
[?] shall remain as I proceed
Cold hidden in the mountain ranch, dig deep
Spent some time in the mud but that’s pigs feed
Nowadays I’m more clean and more crispy
The light hits my eyes with a mystery
Shining up the times that’ve written down my history
Standing outside of a temple in Thailand
The band, a musician, it’s all kind of a blind man
Playing out a song and I start free-styling
Inside my mind while I’m on that island
That island is high with it’s mine and diamonds
Diamonds may shine but that ain’t the light, friend
[Hook: Bless]
This the table where the crow eats
And write songs about the man who will grow to be
Take a seat at the table where the wolf eats
Writing songs and composing all these melodies
Take a seat at the table where the crow eats
Writing songs about the man who will grow to be
This the table where the wolves and the crows eat

[Verse 2: Bless]
Song ain’t me, song ain’t you
It’s more like a table and the meeting of the two
When the heart beats through and the words ring true
When the crow met the wolves and they made they own crew
Blood was the clue but the hunt was the proof that the powers are grew
Together making moods, surviving and laughing and hunting for food
Even fighting too but the fights were proof
Of the house that they built from the floor to the roof
And the bond that they built killed the war, made a truce
Leaves to the branch, to the trunk to the roots
Witness the growth and the truth in this juice

[Hook: Bless]
Yeah, this the table where the crow eats
And write songs about the man who will grow to be
Take a seat at the table where the wolf eats
Writing songs and composing all these melodies
Take a seat at the table where the crow eats
Writing songs about the man who will grow to be
Take a seat at the table where the wolves and the crows eat, eat, eat
Take a seat at the table where the wolves and the crows eat, yeah, yeah

Wished for a rose in December

I will sing with a bluebird
Kiss the rain the bird

In my lonely heart
Once again longing for a breeze
For a rose and kisses
For a little bit of you

Own dream in the twilight
Please tell me of your eyes
Of your lies
When you appear in my dream

Come find me down
In the deep blue sea
Come figure me out in this
Sweet melody of the rain

Wished for a rose in December

Every time that I turn in this tiny apartment
I seem to be right in your way
So I fall down the hall to the shower

If silence was noise you'd be totally deafened
If looks could kill I'd have holes in the back of my head

Maybe it really is the situation
Maybe no one is to blame
Maybe we're not much of a combination
No one's breaking the rules here
We're just playing different games

So you ask me to say what I'm thinking
I tell you I'm not really sure
If I sit on my feelings you'll say I'm aloof
If I share them I'll be immature
So together we stare at the toaster
While the teapot screams out its song
If you can't stand the heat don't sit on the burner
If you don't like the music then don't sing along
You are gripping your composure
Like a climber grips a ledge
I am contemplating closure
I am inches from the edge
Then the tension boils over to anger
And you stare with disgust at your bread
Your fingers find a long strand of hair
That could only have come from my head
Then the anger boils over to action
Something suddenly flies through the air
And I'm faced with the task of extraction
Of butter and toast from my hair

Maybe it really is the situation
Maybe no one's been unfair
Maybe we're not much of a combination
You don't want hair in your butter
I don't want butter in my hair

Now we both think hair is a good thing
We both like butter just fine

Some singers can't sing certain lines

Them a talk, them a talk and talk
Can we talk about needing jobs?
Can we talk about cleaning blocks?
Can we talk about grief and loss?
Can we talk about young black boys?
Out in the street and just get shot
I'm not gonna let them kill a cop soft
Blood on your hands you can't wash
A sermon for a sinner from a prisoner of God
Scream for your life, dream of the dead
Paralyzed by the gun to your head
I can't breathe, with my hands held up
I can't breathe, with my hands held up
Some way, some day
We won't have to cry this way
Some way, some day
My people won't die this way

Every heart is full of hopes and dreams
We've been looking for an answer
How could we know Your voice?
Too loud to ever hear a word You say

And paints skies, and hangs stars, to–

Yeah you know that I’m ready to go
It’s hunting season, & my aim is creeping
I about to pull that trigger slow
See cause I been up for like 4 days
Getting this money like 4 ways
Had to get rid of my old ways
Shit I’m getting better with old age

We goin' in for a while on this one

[Verse]
First off, I just wanna thank God
I'm one in a billion, I'm weighing great odds
The ones who seek change forever stay flawed
That's why the one who smiling in the hoopty gon' get ice cream paint jobs
My grandfather just got out the hospital
Showed me if we manifest thoughts, we’ll make it possible
Uh, dreaming 'bout one day being top dog
Started in the bantam league and now I'm on the all stars
Life is just a glorified stop watch
Passing up time, gon' violate the shot clock
Staying, chucking out records, I be no Knoblaugh
Flipping gold, I just makе my studio a pawn shop
I made this one to let you know I'm hеre to stay
Cruise control activated, I'mma never steer away
Leave it in oblivion, I be agent Gideon
Hop inside the mind of who I wanna be and live in it
I'm minding my own biz
They won't put me on, so I'll climb on my own, kid
The moment that I pop, they gon' dial the phone quick
Forgetting 'bout the anger that they left me alone with
Avoiding the bone picked
A stone's throw distance from the city never sleeping
Torn between the grind and getting lit up every weekend
I'm tryna hit the stage to a sold out beacon
These rapper seek rings, but they quitting mid season
Delivering is vital like a transplant
Homie, fuck dancing
Women doin' handstands for me
'Cause people out in San Fran know me
I got horsepower like a hundred TransAM ponies
So, if you ain't 'bout the hustle, go and hang 'em up
Give more than I'm taking from you, word to Gary Vaynerchuk
They criticize, but only those who really tryna change it up
Tweeting how you run things, you just running data up
Later bruh, I'm workin' on booking tours
Late, I'm up, mixings records, after that, I'm cooking more
Truthfully, I'm motivated, simply just for what's in store
Rap game Tom cat, you more of the cousin George
I got merch back-ordered, don't lay back idle
The fake ones show love but can't name a track title
So, give it to me straight if you don't fuck with me
How you plan to hold me down and never put your trust in me?
I need a plate of penne, à la vodka out in Tuscany
Giving y'all the truth behind bars, no custody
Bet they had enough of me
They sick of seeing plays get made
So they lurking in the shade, never face to face
All this prime time television news is a waste
Never educating people that all are one race
Yeah, we all get one take, there's no redo’s here
I got the sum of all the talent within these dudes here
I make beats, all solo, then write my tracks
Then I mix it all together, I'm the master at that
In my catalog, half of y'all, don't stand close
Cut the check, hit the hard rock, roshambo
All these old folks told me I got old soul flows
But I don't let it hit my head like where that .44 goes
Yeah, I’m back up on my bullshit, y’all just on meds though
Drew this playing out, I forgot I was not Bledsoe
I cannot contest though, trust not in my tenfold
I still need to double check it even if you said so
Phone rings, hello, how can I help?
Yes, ma'am, I need twenty-eight metals like Phelps
A couple gold records, even bronze at least
Just something that can remind me I got them at they knees
All this hate coming more than ever, I let it in
'Cause it shows how everyone around me feeling within
Ever since I graduated, they been doubting my wins
Like I should let my dreams, go and watch 'em fade in the winds
But let me say this again, in case y’all don’t know
I’ll be sticking to the music till I’m six below, woah

Now they formin' habits now
Kids I used to see in strollers started carrying weapons now
Wakin' up to shots fired
Lil' niggas gangbangin' over breakfast now
Scared they finna blow their brains out
Cops checkin' bags like it's JFK
Why you messin' with us?
Squares moved in, whole block left
Rich niggas playin' Tetris with us
Diamonds on my neck stuck to me, they was pressurin' us
Hoes started running extras with them niggas
Most of 'em turned special witness niggas
Always thought of running, it was hell there
Momma was too proud to ask for welfare
Either you was Lance, Sebastian Telfair
Or you brought the pack and moved it elsewhere
We all dreamt of be being Prince of Bel Air
Teachers skipped the name 'cause who the hell cares?
How you let a little nigga sell here?
Wanna hold a pistol, nigga? Hell yeah
NYPD playing catchup
LAPD playing catchup

I was taught don't let a fuck nigga front on me
Hid the weapon in a paper baggy
Either show the gun or get the fuck from in front of me
Only God and momma keep me company
They the ones that saves me from my enemies
I can't even see no similarities
You was stayin' up for Linda Ellerbee
Ran the city, gave me hypertension
You ain't got no problems you just hypin' tension
You ain't tryna squabble, you just like attention
Put my life on the line like I'm Michael Bennett
Shootin' warnings with the hopes you might get mentioned
Had to distance from 'em, went a mile a minute
Used to ask what they would do in my position
'Til they start a sentence with ""In my opinion""
Nigga no, I was livin' off of cold cuts, bread butter and a toaster
Say it on record so when a writer want a close up
You ain't gettin' any closer
Niggas be hittin' me, ""Man I used to love your old stuff
Used to do it for the culture""
Niggas'll use it to try to pay me with exposure
You about to get disposed of
Every time you call my phone, need a loan
Oh no no, I don't even pick it up
Twenty years done come and gone, been the same all along
You don't even switch it up
Throw a chair, then throw a fit
Throw the fair, wouldn't throw the fists
Where's the love? It don't exist
Momma panic, call the pigs
You get out and do it all again

Bunch of old niggas actin' like Peter Pan

You didn't kill him, you shot him in the leg.

Well I'm sorry. I've never shot a gun before.

[Big Daddy Killer]
Just shoot him in the head.

I can't, I've lost the motivation. I'm no longer in the moment.

(Inspired by the play by William Shakespeare)

ACT I
Once past twelve sounds a bell
'Tis bitter cold at Elsinore
Three Danes await and watch the night
For the late king Hamlet's spectral sight
It comes again in warlike form
This spirit of health beckons his son
Father, king, royal Dane?
Tell me the reason why you came
I am the spirit of the king
I walk the night and burn by day
""Till the foul crimes done in my days
Of nature are burnt and purged away""
A serpents sting took my life
Now wears my crown and wed my wife
Avenge my death, remember me
Hamlet my son, kill the king!
ACTS II and III
A noble mind overthrown
Seized with madness
Dethrone!
Somewhat deceptive
To masque his designs
The prince will reap his vengeance in time
His lady love doth think him mad
Lord Chamberlain warns
Stay away!
The actors come hither
Presenting a play
Hamlet's intentions are underway
He has caught the conscience of the king
Railed the queen
Thought Claudius slain
Instead lay dead
The fool Chamberlain
Banished; to England Hamlet is sent

ACT IV
The sails were set for their destruction
Twice fell the night their ship is attacked
Death has strayed from his path to claim sweet Ophelia
The prince now returns enraged with wrath
He falls upon innocence returning to dust
Swears he laertes, Hamlet must
Pay for all grievances put on his house
Conspiracy lingers, the duel; a trap
To be continued...",pop
9108,"Starting at chapter one
You're so predictable
The story starts in the middle, the middle of the song
And when the job wakes with the years and sounds of laughter
The heart is overwhelmed and simply breaks

He's never wanting to lay down and die
It leaves a horrible taste inside, inside
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end

Now hope is in a state and everyone agrees
With humble hearts they fall, they fall to their knees
And I remember why I came here in the first place
The absence of this love that killed me

He's never wanting to lay down and die
It leaves a horrible taste inside, inside
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end
With all that's left to come away with, we'll see this to the end

This won't be the end, this won't be the end of it all
This won't be the end",pop

Captivate, prevaricate, the worst is the yet to come
Just zero-sum directives, from silver forked tongues
A monumental fall, I stop, stare and contemplate how it ends
Crushed in-between, underneath the wheel
Do I have a future, in this desert of the real?
Slow atrophy, schizophrenic dreams
Do I need a conscience in this nihilist regime?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sowing seeds of distress
Left, right, through the center
Reveal the hidden hand
As it propagates vicious and false, invective

Decline and fall, the spear of Osiris
Decline and fall, the kiss of oblivion
Decline and fall, the cult of deception
Decline and fall
[Verse 2]
No ties that bind, except the will to live
Do I have a reason, something more than hate to give?
Apex achiever or food for the worms?
Will I even care once this world begins to burn?

In this dead institution, nowhere to go but down
Another day in the status quo
Another drop in the well of wasted hopes
Orphans in narcosis, longing for a past that never was

Insects, entombed, the woe of time and doom
I spit and curse each day I walk this blighted earth",rock

Just to be with you
What did you do? Nothing to make it happen
And you took advantage of my actions
You were not there, past two years
When I needed you
Now I'm still alone

Denial surrounds a naive boy, as he plays in the field
Precious time escapes him, ignorant to what is real
There's a thief in the shadows waiting to breed
To take away what is his, to take from him what he needs

""Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)""
In his flesh these words have carried on
She worries for him, to keep him calm
Her love runs through forever on, forever true

He fights the truth he has within
Refuses to let the sea of reason in
A father grows numb, his weakness he dare not show...
A child robbed of love, too young to know
The chasm grows too wide, as they struggle to save a precious life, for another day
She sat through nights, and held him tight, thankful for the years
Knowing the end was in sight, accepting what she'd feared...
[Chorus]
""Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)""
In his flesh these words have carried on
She worries for him, to keep him calm
Her love runs through forever on, forever true

As time runs out, (everything he never said...)
Every chance he never took, he plays over in his head...

[Breakdown]
And he screamed at the sky!
The body of a woman that he still loves, lays lifeless before his eyes
A hollow vessel at rest, opens up to the skies!
Does death give way to peace, or just oblivion?
Another life cut short
Another victim of the villain!
My heart has struggled to comprehend, how I'll stick through 'til the end
But even the deepest sorrow, will lose it's scalpel edge!
But even the deepest sorrow, will lose it's scalpel edge!",rock

Wondering about what you have become
You see an empty page
And you feel like you have to run
To a place where you can't remember
But don't be afraid and don't surrender

Run, run from your heart
Run, run from all that you love
Though it tears you apart
It's a game you feel you must play
Run, run away

Every day you drag down
Where is the hope that you held so dear
Where are the goals you made
And why can't you share this weight that you've beared
Your friends try to draw you back in
But you can't escape from where you've been
Run, run from your dreams
Run, run from the nightmare again
Don't wake up with a scream
It's only a matter of prey
Run, run away

Run, run from your past
Run, run from the future in front of you
Don't let this day be your last
You were so young to be betrayed
Run, run away

(Bridge)
Darkness drapes around you like a cloak
Whenever you try to love, the anger chokes
You need to seek out the light
And find for yourself that you're alright

Find a hand and hold on
You don't have to walk this way alone
Face the demons and let them be gone
And again your life will be your own

Run, run to the truth
Run, run, wipe away the tears
Recapture your youth
Feel the pain and then let it fade
Don't run away
Don't run away
(Ooh, run from your past)
You'll fight and you'll stay
(Ooh, run from the future in front of you)
Face another day
(Don't let this day be your last)
Don't run away
(Ooh, run from your heart)
Don't run away
(Ooh, run from all that you love)
Though it tears you apart (Don't run away)
Ooh, run from your past (Don't run away)
Ooh, run from your past (Don't run away)
Ooh, run from your past (Don't run away)
Ooh, run from your past",pop

The wands of smoke are rising
From the walls of the Bastille
And through the streets of Paris
Runs a sense of the unreal

The Kings have all departed
There servants are nowhere
We burned out their mansions
In the name of Robespierre

And still we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

Inside the midnight councils
The lamps are burning low
Oh you sit and talk all through the night
But there's just no place to go

And Bonaparte is coming
With his army from the south
Marat your days are numbered
And we live hand to mouth

While we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind

Wondering why, it echoes
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

The ghost of revolution
Still prowls the Paris streets
Down all the restless centuries
It wanders incomplete

[Verse 6]
It speaks inside the cheap red wine
Of cafe summer nights
Its red and amber voices
Call the cars at traffic lights

So I can't replace for all that I have
To me it's like the reason why
This cry is fading away
So we can breathe for a day

Fighting in the hell
Nightmares are burning in this night

Frightening faces consuming child

Cannot be broken
The sea of the awaken one
All that I fear
It's rotting hard beneath the sea

Seven waves to keep it alone
All restrictions are undone
Recognize there's a focus
It's so far

Little pleasures they will share

I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill
Holding hands at the movie show
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes
To a degree
I love the common folks
That includes me
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz
How about you?

I’m feeling rebellious (Woo!), come on, step to me, I’ll be letting off shots like the Celtics
The way I fuck on ya bitch, you'd be jealous (You'd be fuckin' jealous)
Can’t walk that talk, if you talkin' fake Margiela's (No, you can't)
Don’t rain on my parade (Nope), y'all throwing that shade like open umbrellas (Woo!)
Feel like I can’t be tamed, on the prowl for my prey like a leopard (True!)
Spin up on your block like a record, how many opps can I kill? Beat a rеcord
Suplex slam in a jam, Brock Lesner, smokе him like a hippie, with that piece
Yeah, my name John. but you ain’t seen a motherfucker like me
Serve a crack fiend up a Tylenol, watch him dance, no Billie Jean
Thinkin' you could magically rap like this, not even in your dreams (You can't match)
Ain’t no blood but I’m a bee (Nope), 'cause I’ll pollinate ya bitch seed (Woo!)
I’m as real as it gets, no fakin' here like a live feed
I’m in my element, you dumb as fuck if you think I would leave (Stupid!)
Damn, I’m getting worked up, take a breath there’s a reason for all these trees
Body’s falling all around, but fall faster than these leaves
Ain’t no putt, putt, grab the iron when I aim, hit no green
Killing spree, Assassin's Creed, knock 'em out. I’m talkin creed
Damn, you need to learn how to bob and weave (Bob and weave)
In my element, it’s so evident that no one's beating me
I got other rappers scared I was gonna diss and I have receipts
Whooped a dude who claimed he MS-13 and I stole his jeans
This rapper at his neck, right off his neck, I took his peace
I'll get a him with the TEC', like Popeye, pop 'em for that green
My pump is gonna take his breath, lose his life, his soul will flee
Take his life and leave him dead, I’ll take a stand you can take a knee
Pistol packin', never lackin', you ain't catchin' me
Slangin' weight and hittin' plays, no Drew Brees (Nope)
I don’t know no fuckin judges, who is Judy? (Who?)
Spin up on ya block, smoothie
Gunshots (Boom!) like a ASMR soothing

Got 'em shook the moment that I show up, Rap God, bitch, you know him

Let them bitches sing like Joseph
Like Caine, I'm a menace, I'm mixed with Lil' Dennis, put the steel at his neck like a chain
And the clip gonna hang like a pedant, if yo' homie want it, too
Like a rhyme, how he’ll get the same endin', the way that I rap is so mind blowin'
Got me thinkin' that I'm in the movie Tenet
Yeah, I'm nuts with this shit like I'm Cole Bennett
With the pen, like I wrestle, you not on my level, I'm cookin' you youngin's like Hansel and Gretel
I'm steppin' on top like a pedal, you say I ain't 'bout it, then go 'head and meddle
The moment you show up, get hit with the metal, I'll aim at ya mouth and then knock out your dental
I'll bang like a drum, no, you don't want the treble
They watchin' my movements, I'm bodyin' shit like I came off the rental
They couldn't touch me, I'm a free guy like Reynolds, they madder than Max and they know I'm a rebel
They spottin' the bars and they know I'm a God, but they don't wanna face it, no freckles

Walk away now close your mouth end of discussion

Yeah, sit down make yourself comfortable
I was going to work the other morning
And these two chicks were on the bus, and they were
Running their mouths off about everybody's business
Yeah, you know how women are
Talk, talk, talk
Well then they were talking about my business, so I listened
Your name and my name came up
Yeah, they were saying things like
""Yeah, Margie ain't got a man tight no more
He'd been tippin' up town
And Marilyn's gonna take him from her if she don't look out""
Who's Marilyn?
I don't know who she is, you tell me who she is
They don't know what they're talking about
They seem pretty sure to me
Yeah, you know what?
They even mentioned the word love
Yeah, the word love
Well if you got so much respect for love
At least respect for our love
Then why don't you try proving it?
How? You don't know how to prove it?
Well what you just do is

Stop, in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over (Think it over, baby baby)

Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
It's time you leave my door
I watch you walkin' down the street
Knowing your other love you're gonna to meet
This time before you run to her
Leavin' me all alone, alone to cry
Having her been sweet to you

[Chorus]
Stop, in the name of love
(Before you break my heart)
(Stop it) Think it over baby
(Stop in the name of love) Think it over

[Verse 2]
Tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
It's time I see you, you and her together
Got it, baby baby babe
I'm afraid I'll be losing you forever
Stop it, baby

Stop in the name of love

The love I've lost is surely hard to find
For I know not what I do

Can you tell mе who's the lonely one?

As we fade into the night
You played the fool for all to see
Now you're drowning in your misery
Reachin' out for something new
From a different point of view

Pull triggers, push dope, them figures might double up, stuntin' (uh huh)
Can't nobody tell bruh nothin' (uh huh)

Hey, can I get another one? Heatin' up
NBA Jam, on fire, deep in us
Goin' hard like the score might even up
But it won't, Too Cold, I'm sleevin' up
Why be ashamed, we seen enough
He was bleedin', no breathin' and beaten up

Well let me give the rumors Sudafed right now
And put 'em all to bed right now

Yes, I am tryna get this bread right now (just playin')
I know some people erasin' our names, say we vacated our claims
And I’m like, “Well, it is 10 years later; we changed""
We ain't take paper and trade it for shame
We took our time navigatin' our lanes
When we made mistakes, we should take all the blame
But we still unashamed of the same name
Shoot for the sky, baby, bang bang
And we ride with the same gang
Nothin' but the blood from the same veins

The Man and the Ghost

As you desire the sun, so you desire your friend's return.
Tibetan Proverb.

ONCE upon a time a man was walking along a narrow mountain path, when he met a ghost. The ghost turned around at once and walked along beside him. The man was very much frightened, but didn't care to let the ghost know it. Pretty soon they came to a river which had to be crossed, and as there was no bridge or boat both had to swim it. The man, of course, made a good deal of noise, splashing and paddling the water, while the ghost made none at all.

Said the ghost to the man: ""How does it happen that you make so much noise in the water?""

The man answered, ""Oh, I am a ghost and have a right to make all the noise I want to.""

""Well,"" the ghost replied, ""suppose we two become good friends, and if I can help you I will, and if you can ever aid me you will do so.""

The man agreed, and as they walked along the ghost asked him what he feared more than anything else in the world. The man said he wasn't afraid of anything he saw, though inwardly quaking all the while. Then he asked the ghost what he was afraid of. ""Of nothing at all,"" said the ghost, ""but the wind as it blows through the tall-headed barley fields.""

By and by they came near a city, and the ghost said he was going in to town. But the man said he was tired and that he would lie down and sleep a while in the barley field at the edge of the city. The ghost went on into town and played havoc, as ghosts generally do. He proceeded to steal the soul of the king's son and tying it up in a yak hair sack carried it out to the edge of the barley field where the man lay asleep, and called out to him, ""Here is the soul of the king's son in this bag. I'll leave it here for a while and you can take care of it for me, as I have a little business elsewhere.""

So saying, he put the sack down and went away. The man now disguised himself as a holy lama, begging tsamba, and, carrying his prayer wheel and the sack, started for the city. When he arrived he heard at once that the king's son was about to die and he knew what was the matter with him. So he went to the palace begging and the king's chamberlain said to him, ""You are a very holy man, perhaps you can do something to help the king's son get well."" The man said he would try if they would let him in to see the king.
When the king saw him he said, ""If you will heal my son, I'll give you half of all I have, lands, gold, cattle and everything."" So the man said he would. He took his yak hair sack, sat down on the ground, cross-legged, as all Buddhists sit, made a little idol of tsamba meal, opened the sack and thrust it in, allowing the soul to escape. Then he tied the mouth of the bag with nine knots, blew his breath upon it, said many charms and prayers over it, and while he talked, lo, they brought the king word that the boy was recovering. The father was so pleased and happy, he kept his word and gave the man half of all he possessed. The ghost never, so the story goes, came back or claimed the sack he had left with the man, and the man thought, ""Perhaps that is the customary etiquette between a man and a ghost.""",misc

Let's just get this rumor out the way
What was it again? A Goonies orgy?
A train?
That's a loco motive (locomotive) to initiate in a gang
What a shame
I guess it is my fault, I was in groupie mode
Lookin' at myself like, ""Minaj record? You a 'Stupid Ho'""
I lowkey started the rumor myself, and now it's killin' me
I mean, I was just speakin' my dream: somniloquy
Playin' my role, until thots (thoughts) allowed on stage: soliloquy
Somethin' 'bout that night's a blur...but I try to reminisce it
I just remember Mack Mel from the back like, ""Hold it down by the chicken!""
Now it's Glu', stuck in the corner
Lookin' like his great-grandfather the Colonel, finger-lickin'
And Ryda, Ryda...Ramone
Oh, Ryda Ramone (rider'll moan) like a bitch without even hittin'
Okay, it's startin' to come back
I thought I liked bitches until I see three (C3) straps, a big butt, and had to reconsider
Yo, she just different
I'll fuck your best friend, your Ace, I mean (Amin)
And Qu' been (Quban) knew he need to bring a bulletproof vest for me
Kept makin' Holmzie mad - you remember when Holmzie was a Goonie briefly?
By sayin' B. Dot the God like, ""Homie, you give Muslim vibes. Why not try Holmzie Allah?""
That's hypocritical at that
Plus he like, ""If you fuck up my name again, consider you smacked.""
Then it hit me...the star's missin'
We really need a Raivon to get this party in the right swing
I mean, I need that coma. Clap!
A good night's sleep
I need us to get back Twork (to work) like the right-wing
So fuck Drugz!
I bet you looked up my ex to see (ecstasy) how I party, Drugz (drugs)
I'm dope, so up against a pothead, we'd (weed) see you hardly, Drugz (drugs)
You get stepped on, you battle too much, you not floatin'
It will not work, you not Twork
Last-minute, you both rushin'
Switches and Casey worried 'bout preppin' (Prep and) some dope substance?
Nigga...are y'all tryin' to sway the audience?
You my nigga, but I'll sever (Sevah) ties
On this true day of Sabbath, my nigga, I'll sabotage
I got a cause
Yo, she G...
And we be wantin' to call you by your government
I think that's what you should use if (Yusef) Drugz not it
You not potent, we not quotin'
(*Drugz impression*) ""LLAMAS bla-""
Nigga, pick a new move!
Plus I wanna see the man behind the Llama: you need a New Groove
So to call you ""Drugz"" does you no justice
I mean, yes, you get cooked, bagged, but you never control substance
So fuck you, fuck Goonies as a crew!
Cheeko, Beasley, Smack, for 100K, I will fuck y'all too

[Round 1: Drugz]
As far as struggles only women can relate to, you a true victim
You told us stories how you been in relationships wit' all these abusive and cool niggas
Bitch, one of them stories broke my heart so bad, I wanted to whoop the nigga ass and...I ain't even have nothin' to do wit' it
'Cause honestly, all that domestic violence shit, I'm really not cool wit' it
I do not believe in puttin' your hands on women...
(*chk-chk*) I shoot bitches!
I'm too livid
I heard y'all talkin'
Now watch me string little Yo-Yo along
And after I drop a round on this trick, y'all gon' say I dog-walked her!
This what y'all offer!? Food!
I knew, and y'all knew
And you ain't even think you was gonna win
Just wanted to be wit' 13 niggas in a small room
Why they even CALL you!?
You lookin' at a savage in the flesh
Wit' a large tool, FNJs clappin' through her vest
That bitch was far too, but the grip make it accurate at its best
All them nudes you sent...you should be used to attachments on the TECs (texts)!
I'm vexed!
Your mother next!
Front steps, knock-knock, ""Your daughter started drama.""
Cut her head off and bring it on stage, like ""This is your mama"" like Wil Valderrama!
She a goner, I bring a beam
Everybody wanna be on The Gun Show - (*chk-chk*) - 'til they in deleted scenes!
You ain't seasoned, queen!
You gotta rap wit' me, so just call it quits
'Cause you don't got one quotable that don't involve a dick
I'm tired of this, and y'all let her slide wit' this
She says some basic sexual shit, and you act like this bitch cooking
Shock value 'cause she talks about sucking a fuckin' dick?
That's what I don't get fully
That shit only shocking to niggas who don't get pussy!
I swear to God I'm so tired of hearing 'bout this bitch cookie!
You talk about it every five seconds, it makes it less arousin'
This snub ain't nothin' to mess around wit'
.38 in her box: let's see what's so Special 'bout it!
Go to the trunk, pull the weapon out it
I'm 'bout to slide, y'all!
This 100-round drum? My God!
I just throw it in the machine and press a button like a Tide Pod!
Side bar! The nerve of
A bitch who only fucks stars, but baby daddy's a battle rapper we never heard of
Y'all done hyped this bird up! This shit unsuitable!
How that pussy top-tier, but your baby daddy in the Crucible!?
This is unusual!
What the fuck is this?
You said you had a thousand dollars for anybody that can prove you mess wit' a lower-tier battle rapper
I want my money, bitch

[Round 2: Yoshi G]
I said, this for Kim
You know, a Queen Be(e) wit' somethin' Big (B.I.G.)
Poppa Drugz
Nah, you got me pissed, dirty
P.O. visit: for this smoke, I will risk bars for Drugz (drugs)
I lost too much to addiction, so now I'm hard on Drugz (drugs)
And if I'm prone to it, and the arm come out, it's not in vain (vein)
It left scars for Drugz (drugs)
I don't fuck wit' you niggas...or none of you bitches either
They my daughters, while he (Wally) my first son like Mrs. Cleaver
I didn't know what gun to rap about, and I tried to Google some shit
Fuck - I just know I need a body on the ground when I chalk it out
Gun Show? I hope so, 'cause ain't shit inside your rounds
Your friends gas you, B
Truth say you won...in your head like Cassidy
Yusef, if you know what's best for you, better use what you rap for me
Or you gon' be a pretty little lightskin casualty
I'm talkin' 'bout you need to actually be... dumping on stage, son...Lyt's kin mentality
Nigga, I'm ready to fight - grapple me
I will put facts wit' cap like Snapple tea
A thot (thought) assemble words together to line a square: come Scrabble me
Bad trap queen: I'm not gon' hold you, Drugz (drugs)
Nancy Reagan said it best: ""Just Say No to Drugz (drugs).""
I dare (D.A.R.E.) you - try and school me, it's gon' be over, Drugz (drugs)
I mean, you may be a Blood, but Negro...you ain't no thug
I seen you gettin' cracked in the street so bad...
Geechi Gotti proved trees was a gateway, Drugz (drugs)
See, that's my way
'Cause I see a QP on the highway would leave a bitch behind bars in a tri-state
That's true addiction
""We want that old Yoshi! No New Edition!""
What? Now how that sound?
Mad 'cause I was Humpin' Around?
If it's My Prerogative, why Every Step I Take they try knockin' me down!?
This got me down!
Fuckin' tournament! FUCKIN' MONEY! THIS GOT ME DOWN!
I lost EVERYONE in my life because of Drugz (drugs) like Bobby Brown!
So yes, I'mma stay showin' my ass onstage for shine
Only right I mention Mooning you
Nigga, I cannot believe what you let that old man do to you
I mean, I got my own V.A. stripes
Wig on the street without the Adidas suit
I'm just kinda...pissed the Gun Show didn't have to bust a move
'Cause when your homie had to come to your rescue, I almost lost my cool
The bigger .9 I expected, but to pull out...was somethin' I ain't know Twork can do
Now get me lit!
""Yo, she (Yoshi) gon' be eatin' some sh-""

It gets dark
Get dark

""Shout out to my mammy, she live in Miami""
She told you ""Don't stop poppin' that pussy"", right?
As a father, instantly I was so lost
Now let's fast-forward four bars
She got pregnant wit' you at 15, and had she aborted you, her folks woulda offered her her own car
So she took on the struggles of being a teen mom, and then you bragged to us about how she was so strong
And this what you choose to do with the life she gave you? You so wrong
I bet you she knew what she knows now, she woulda drove off!
This ho lost!
Thot bars? You really need to start reflectin'
Your daughter's at a age she can get on the Internet and watch what you do
You gotta really realize who your cause affectin'
She can open an app and watch her mother rap about suckin' and fuckin' her way to the top
Givin' her false impressions
You really think your mother gave up a car just to watch you steer your daughter IN THE WRONG DIRECTION!?
That thot shit was cool as first, but now it's all in question
'Cause that same little girl you kiss on the forehead and say ""Good night"" to
Is the same one that looks on the screen when you say you get fucked 'til you scream and wants to be just like you
So when she walks in the house pregnant as a teen, she can in no way be spiteful
I mean, she got it from her mama
Who else is there to be blamed besides you?
Why not teach her about birth control? 'Cause you supposed to break the cycle!
You the one she gon' stay up late and cry to!
Well, at least try to
But Mommy's always out of town chasin' battle rap when she should be doin' much more
'Cause you're currently in a situation where they're trying to take the kids you adore
So I'm tryna figure out how you state-to-state every weekend when you goin' through a custody battle in yours
I'm floored
You keep your son away from his dad so he has no chance to look up to a man
But he's too busy when he says, ""Hey, Ma. Look, I'm in a band.""
Meanwhile, you're in Virginia getting your ass whooped at BANNED
This shit is sad
When her daughter's sick, she's 'posed to be givin' her soup at night
Mommy's too busy bookin' her flight for the next Super Fight
You really think how you movin' right?
Chasin' battle rap, leavin' them kids alone?
Why the fuck you at NOME when you 'posed to be at home!?
Teachin' her how to be a queen but you on Watch The-
What the FUCK is goin' on!?
Yoshi, you are GROWN!
In yo' mid-30s, actin' like a fuckin' clown
I don't care what you say
99% of every woman's goal is to settle down
But the way you act? It'll never be
Clean yourself up...or URL's anniversary card gon' be the only one you ever see
I couldn't let it be, but you my friend, so I did what I should
Made sure you understood
You too worried about the Brotherhood
You need to be worried about your motherhood!

STOP PLAYIN' WIT' ME!!!
NIGGA, WHAT'S A ""THOT BAR""!?
Hopin' Jakk' get Top off? That's literally nothin' (nuttin') for me
I'm that sick, but psychologically, why am I like this?
Why when I see a D, HD- (ADHD)?
Drugz (drugs), I need an addy right quick
All hazy, hormones raging, I need to make a life switch
I'm just Living Single
I say...hormones raging, I'm just Living Single, I better make a life switch
Like ""Turn off getting turned on by some light dick""
I never seen so much darkness in a bright bitch!
And if I couldn't rap, I wouldn't gain shit!
(*Yoshi takes a couple deep breaths*)
I just dropped my daughter off to her father in Atlanta
We in a tournament...
Fuck that...we actually co-parent, so it's his turn, I meant
And any objection by me for him to see his daughter would be outta pocket
This isn't in my genes, I didn't inherit this logic
It's just a generational curse, and I'm determined to stop it
And I gotta stop puttin' it on my father, 'cause it's a pain split
I mean, it didn't help hearin' my mama keep tellin' me, ""Yo' daddy ain't shit""
Or ""Get out my face! You look just like that nigga! You makin' me sick!""
So if at my best, I'm my father's daughter, I'm only embracin' what I was taught he is
And no, I don't blame you, Mama, but it's no wonder a negative thot (thought) exists
I say that to say this: you're a good father
I thought that you should know
I think the way you fight to be in your baby girl's life is beautiful
Baby mamas purposely keepin' the child out of the father's life cruel and unusual
I root for you
I cannot imagine what that kind of pain would do to you
Just don't give up, Drugz
I know that's like a oxymoronic way to soothe you through
So if this gives you any comfort, I guarantee she'll bring your daughter to your funeral
You think you controllin' my mental?

[Drugz]
That was crazy

[Yoshi G]
Sike, Drugz (psych drugs)
I'm crazy
I need a saving A. Ward and a Valium, that's a white drug
Keyshia Cole...""I Should Have Cheated""!
Nah, that's a jam for me
'Cause I wanna be, artistically free
Mr. 1-10 on the App! That give me a 90% chance of kickin' yo' ass
I could even beat you wit' a light ars': ""Nigga, you trash!""
I just need a ounce of thot (thought) to get Drugz (drugs) fully bagged
I see you bitches watchin'
I'm the anomaly, you the option
Get to know me

May 13th will make a year since I've seen my daughter

Fugazi, fugazi, it's a wazy it's a woozie. It's fairy dust

I gots to talk, I gotta tell what I feel
I gotta talk about my life as I see it

Biggie
This one goes out to you...
Mother fuckers
HiDef
Lets get it

[Verse 1]
Kick in the door and its on
Smacking them like donkey kong
Can't help but feel like I’m on
Top of the world
On top of your girl
“Unh!""
Watch the lyrics unfurl
Hit them with the master plan
*pop!*
Pop champagne and the xan
Give a fuck about the bands
I do this for the music
I just snap and loose it
Grab the fucking uzi
Tear up yo walls and I
Tear up yo frame
Whatever it takes to break into the game
Some of these famous mother fuckers lame
Acting too tame
In the wild wild west
Love for my people fuck the rest
Sweat dripping, i can see they stressed
[Verse 2]
When the squad pull up
Shit gets real
Unbreakable like Hanzo steel
Maybe you in the wrong field
If you thinking you in rap
Run home you better go back and rethink your life
Cause my future too bright
Y’all getting played out
Momma told you to come home by dark
I stayed out
On my goon-shit
Moon-lit streets
Nikes on my feet
Pocket full of swisha sweets
Life of a Geed
So I could focus on my music
Focus on my craft
Stay posted with a life raft
Cause my flow so wet
I show no regret
When I don’t share my sticky icky
When I slay the mic real quickly
Everybody know it's dangerous to cover biggie
Especially when you white like Jimmy
Fallon
I gas the mic by the gallon
Light the match
Watch the flames
Courtside for the game
And I put that on the family name
Check mate for the chess game
Y’all childs play
So get off me
You know you can't stop me
HD just dropped heat
[Chorus]
Put the game up in flames until they all scream my name Damn!
Put the game up in flames until they all scream my name Damn!

[Verse 3]
I had to put the game up in flames
Cause half these mother fuckers fake.. they fugazi
They just my cause me
To snap and go off and the mic
As long as my producer keeps my levels tight
Yeah the levels
Band full of rebels
I turn up the bass and I turn down the treble
Now we really bumpin’
We thumpin’
Keep my ear to the streets and these panicked fools jumpin’
At the sight of the kid
Praying on the plight of the kid
But shit
None of y’all can deter my vision
My lyrical precision
I put the game up in flames now we blowing up like nuclear fission
BOOM!

[Chorus]
Put the game up in flames until they all scream my name Damn!
Put the game up in flames until they all scream my name Damn!

What we tasted in the kiss

Vainly we congratulate
Our escape from such a fate
As their lying lips could send,

Tom Van Arden, my old friend,
Hearts, like fruit upon the stem,
Ripen sweetest, I contend,
As the frost falls over them:
Your regard for me to-day
Makes November taste of May,
And through every vein of rhyme
Pours the blood of summer-time.

When our souls are cramped with youth
Happiness seems far away
In the future, while, in truth,
We look back on it to-day
Through our tears, nor dare to boast,--
""Better to have loved and lost!""
Broken hearts are hard to mend,
Tom Van Arden, my old friend.

Tom Van Arden, my old friend,
I grow prosy, and you tire;
Fill the glasses while I bend
To prod up the failing fire. . . .
You are restless:--I presume
There's a dampness in the room.--
Much of warmth our nature begs,
With rheumatics in our legs! . . .

Humph! the legs we used to fling
Limber-jointed in the dance,
When we heard the fiddle ring
Up the curtain of Romance,
And in crowded public halls
Played with hearts like jugglers' balls.--
FEATS OF MOUNTEBANKS, DEPEND!--
Tom Van Arden, my old friend.

Tom Van Arden, my old friend,
Pardon, then, this theme of mine:
While the firelight leaps to lend
Higher color to the wine,--
I propose a health to those
Who have HOMES, and home's repose,
Wife- and child-love without end!

If i could go back in time

But thats okay

You'll be scared to love
Cause your heart don't trust its ways
But you'll find your way
And girls will play with your heart like its a game
And you'll deal with a sorta bad dad
And feel life people don't listen
And you'll feel like you don't have what you really have
And sometimes people just don't care

8240,"Now I don't wanna go on a death trip
I wanna go on a life journey
It's a beautiful truth, yet I worry, like my neighbors
Yet when someone asks us how were doing in the morning we say fine
But that's sort of a lie, it's more complex
There is stress, problems, we all got em
So I'm stomping through the swamplands of the soul
I'm searching for rainbows in oil spills
And I feel afraid, in pain and awake
And I wanna laugh, because why does life have
To be so hard
So I'm asking god, because the predators pain of hunger
Was the prays, pain of death, and we all need food
So what you gonna do, chew
Money is too important i'm tired of being poor
I got a right to bear arms, i wear my heart on my sleeve
I've marched in the streets, made hand sign for peace
Next to protestors beat up by police
I've prayed to a Buddha, made in a sweat shop
I guess we suffer so a sad, song can sound good
So I love the pain, I'm grateful
Because after pain comes breakthrough
Breakthrough well let me take you
To the belly of the beast
Live in the system where daily I ask you this question
Do you fight me, run from me, or try to become me

The beast is real, it is a machine
That feeds off souls
It is in high schools, army recruiting
The street corner shooting, over your shoulder
It is those disturbing urges
Your empty envy lust and greed
It is your failure, it is your addiction and it is shape shifting
It will make you ignore your children
And with your partner, it is your aggression
When we get too self defensive, burning bridges building fences
You don't need nobody as long as you got money
But what you gonna do when the money's all gone
Really makes you think about how you treat your family
And those other people, your neighbors, strangers
When you all hear the warnings
Of global warming, political turmoil
The stakes is high, stuck in a traffic jam
Was a man with a sign that read

Another day, another dollar
Searching for joy, sometimes you find sorrow
So we take a deep breath and pray we get it right tomorrow
Now I don't wanna sing lullabies at the graveyard
Of childhood dreams
They got comfy chairs there tv's with big screens
But the revolution won't be televised
It will be in the lives we live
When we stop giving pain to the ones we love
When we participate in the world we live in
Within natures rhythms
We go to work, love our job
Come home smiling ready to play
And the kids don't know abut the stress we endure
They only know were only hear for la, la, love
Cuz after the last
War has been fought
None have won
We will see all have lost
I'll cross my roads
Stack my stones
Draw my line in the sand and just beyond
There is a place
Where love is the answer to every question
I will meet you there
The end of the rainbow, the pot of gold
But until then my friend

Another day another dollar
Searching for joy, sometimes you find sorrow
So we take a deep breath and pray we get it right
Tomorrow
Now i stay up late and meditate
At twilight i write
So if in the morning you ask me
How am i doing
Well i'm late for work
But afterwords we can share the verse
About our loves
Mine is my family
About our beliefs
Mine is peace
About our dreams
Mine is to be a fresh mc
So this right here is the song I sing

Another day, another dollar
Searching for joy, sometimes ya find sorrow
So we take a deep breath and pray we get it right
Tomorrow",rap

Who needs love? It's a waste of time
Come on over, girl, we can waste all night

Lonely like me
I'll do it like no other
I'm just finding my peace
Until I get my piece
If you're lonely like me
Love isn't so fucked up
It's just so out of reach
I hope you don't get lonely like me

Come on over, girl, you can waste all mine

2267,"His bicycle stood at the window-sill,
The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher
Skirting the front mudguard,
Its fat black handlegrips

Heating in sunlight, the ‘spud’
Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back,
The pedal treads hanging relieved
Of the boot of the law.

His cap was upside down
On the floor, next his chair.
The line of its pressure ran like a bevel
In his slightly sweating hair.

He had unstrapped
The heavy ledger, and my father
Was making tillage returns
In acres, roods, and perchеs.

Arithmetic and fear.
I sat staring at the polishеd holster
With its buttoned flap, the braid cord
Looped into the revolver butt.
‘Any other root crops?
Mangolds? Marrowstems? Anything like that?’
‘No.’ But was there not a line
Of turnips where the seed ran out

In the potato field? I assumed
Small guilts and sat
Imagining the black hole in the barracks.
He stood up, shifted the baton-case

Farther round on his belt,
Closed the domesday book,
Fitted his cap back with two hands,
And looked at me as he said goodbye.

A shadow bobbed in the window.
He was snapping the carrier spring
Over the ledger. His boot pushed off
And the bicycle ticked, ticked, ticked.",misc

Philsner DDI

[Verse 1: Philsner]:
She ain't loyal is she ain't jelous no more
She never asks where you come from no more Another nigga taping where you taping dude
You be loyal and she be twerking for another dude

It's all about money and you ain't got it
If you want loyalty you better to buy it
Love doesn't pay bills is what bitches say
It's unbelievable like when witches pray

Nowadays on the phone it's short conversations No more sweet names she called you an angel Moody girl with a big booty but no brain
It's official she only smiles on your pay day

[Hook: Chris Brown]:
When a rich nigga want ya, and your nigga can't do nothing for ya. (These hoes ain't loyal...)X2

[Verse 2: Philsner]:
Loyalty is very expensive to cheap people
They all seem like saints but yet so evil
These girls heard I was friends with Dj Dimplez Now they all over my face like pimples
They f around but never admitting it
She told me she got a man but I'm still hitting it (I'm feeling it)
I wonder what my girl is doing while I'm doing this
Love is a business they all in it for profit

I forfeit, it's all shit, you make me sick so I vomit In this love shit, I don't fit
I'm good with the flow call me a dolphin
Love has no guidance like an orphan

[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Verse 3: Philsner]:
Twitter and Instagram is where you gonna find them
I tell them to turn around I like it when I'm behind them
Don't fool yourself you not the only one
You don't got cheddar you sleep together but you hitting none

She got more weaves than a weave factory
Puts on make-up even when unnecessary
Non stop on the phone, texts while you talking She sleeps around like her bed was a circle turning

I'm just having fun is what they always say Couple of sips they already wanna give it away We all getting laid, its a party right
Everything goes tonight please switch off the lights

[Hook: Chris Brown]
[Verse 4: Philsner]
All of these girls want me, im ready to penetrate
I feel like they haunt me, many rounds to calculate
We share a bed like we room mates
High as an eagle, I get blown more than a whistle

No lie don't trust hoes at all
Tell me about your man and I show you the door
I hit it better, cloud 9 comma 5 boo
I make it rain on you like a shower in a bathroom

She ain't loyal when u start getting a weird look
All of these hoes are only beautiful on Facebook
They always wanna give it up to richer men
Many fishes in the sea I'm a good fisher man/

[Hook]

Bridge[Chris Brown]:
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you fronting?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it's all for nothing

This Ones for those on the dead end street
Hustlin hard to make all they ends meet
I hope one day I see yo benz creep
Watch for the jealousy that most friends keep
S-P got the Bentley
All I can do is thank god cause he blessed me
I used to be just like you
Slangin crack rock on the avenue
Packin Glocks and runnin from cops
Most of my clients like they cane on the rocks
Gun shots like 2 blocks away
I wonda who the fuck caught a hot one today
Neva mind cause I don't wanna know
I just lost two good friends in the row
One second things is lookin beautiful
The next second you can start off the funeral

Some locked up and some are R-I-P

Sunny Side money makers
In Hillwood we had rocks big as now and laterz
QuikStop was the store where we slung at
Everybody knew me for my hundred packs
Across the street was law elementry

They wanna be like me a tru hustla
Cause they daddy drives an old gas guzzla
The dope deala I ain't tryina brag but
Fuck watchin roaches tryina climb out my bath tub
I was a hard head tryina be a drug lord
Slow my roll nah homie what the fuck for
Im in the 2 bed trailor man im dirt poor
When hurricanes would kome id run next door
To my homies house his name is huet hodges
We gonna make out this ghetto man I promise

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
99 percent of all criminals are dope dealers
Get busted by bullets or fuckin squeelers
And the One percent that made it was pure luck
But even he'll tell that his life ain't worth a fuck
Cause in his mind he was caught a thousand times
And in his mind he was shot a thousand times
Without peace there can be no happiness
I wear a cross around my neck like the catholics
Im not sure exaclty what my religion is
I just know I thank god for my little kids
This is the baddest sellin drugs like sum guinnie pigs
Then they arrest us after we done make it big
They take our money our cars and our houses
Now tell me whos really sellin the ounces
And any cash that we might have hidden

Do your job, and it will come, dick in logic's ass
I hold the steering wheels, although I don't know exactly where I am going
I pass another intersection, whores on the corner, dealers at the gate
This rap is scissors, I cut open the packaging
The price of botox is flying, beautiful ladies are getting cheap
It is not always as planned
Many are sitting here for slander
Life spins like shit in the pitchеr
Get up, don't get up, and get down to thе ground

And this speed is not for you

And you don't pretend to be a gangster
I'm at the helm
Although I don't know exactly where I'm going
Mordo, don't confuse the street with Twitter
Because you will not delete the post here
It's easy for someone to make a scandal
Not knowing anyone at all
Take better go and find yourself
And you don't follow the crowd blindly
Total chaos on the planet
Ever since the bacteria became human
Flies, toads, spiders, snakes
Man pretends to be a bat
Pupils wider, corridors narrower
Heavier subjects, thinner borders
Larger envelopes, smaller churches
The priest has already attended the carol
And what will it be?
Even worse, even more expensive

I take a joint and fire it up

Picking up the pieces of a heart that's been dismantled

For any trinket of treasure, for

Understand or pity me –
We're only chained together
One life is lost and
All the rest – remains

All the others seem shallow
All this running around

It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I'm gonna be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen

3601,"To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart britchka—a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors, retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of about a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen of the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a gentleman—a man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not over-fat, and not over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young. His arrival produced no stir in the town, and was accompanied by no particular incident, beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it. ""Look at that carriage,"" one of them said to the other. ""Think you it will be going as far as Moscow?"" ""I think it will,"" replied his companion. ""But not as far as Kazan, eh?"" ""No, not as far as Kazan."" With that the conversation ended. Presently, as the britchka was approaching the inn, it was met by a young man in a pair of very short, very tight breeches of white dimity, a quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and a dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped bronze tie-pin. The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively; after which he clapped his hand to his cap (which was in danger of being removed by the wind) and resumed his way. On the vehicle reaching the inn door, its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi, or waiter, of the establishment—an individual of such nimble and brisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was impossible. Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form clad in a tailcoat, reaching almost to the nape of his neck, he tossed back his locks, and escorted the gentleman upstairs, along a wooden gallery, and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the gentleman's reception. The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary appearance, since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all provincial towns—the species wherein, for two roubles a day, travellers may obtain a room swarming with black-beetles, and communicating by a doorway with the apartment adjoining. True, the doorway may be blocked up with a wardrobe; yet behind it, in all probability, there will be standing a silent, motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn every possible detail concerning the latest arrival. The inn's exterior corresponded with its interior. Long, and consisting only of two storeys, the building had its lower half destitute of stucco; with the result that the dark-red bricks, originally more or less dingy, had grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes. As for the upper half of the building, it was, of course, painted the usual tint of unfading yellow. Within, on the ground floor, there stood a number of benches heaped with horse-collars, rope, and sheepskins; while the window-seat accommodated a sbitentshik 4, cheek by jowl with a samovar 5—the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that, but for the fact of the samovar possessing a pitch-black lip, the samovar and the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair.

During the traveller's inspection of his room his luggage was brought into the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys. The bearers of the same were the gentleman's coachman, Selifan (a little man in a large overcoat), and the gentleman's valet, Petrushka—the latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn, over-ample jacket which formerly had graced his master's shoulders, and possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen expression. Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch-box of redwood, lined with birch bark, a boot-case, and (wrapped in blue paper) a roast fowl; all of which having been deposited, the coachman departed to look after his horses, and the valet to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak, a bagful of livery, and his own peculiar smell. Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall, he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress—a remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also as greasy) as a pancake—which he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment.

While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman had repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of the kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished walls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke, are, in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers' backs—more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as, on market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to the local hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind invariably contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a selection of oil paintings. In short, there are certain objects which one sees in every inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld. A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures (of unknown origin, period, and creation) which reach us—sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art—from Italy; owing to the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted them.

To resume, however—our traveller removed his cap, and divested his neck of a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for her husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded. True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case, God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part, I cannot endure them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner, and whilst the various dishes were being got ready—cabbage soup, a pie several weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of sausages and cabbage, a roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments; whilst, I say, these things were either being warmed up or brought in cold, the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle-tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount of income which the hostelry produced, and the character of its present proprietor. To the last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in such cases—namely, ""My master is a terribly hard man, sir."" Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him! Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town, who President of the Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short, he omitted no single official of note, while asking also (though with an air of detachment) the most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood. Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and how many of them? How far from the town did those landowners reside? What was the character of each landowner, and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town? The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside. Was there, he asked, much sickness about—whether sporadic fever, fatal forms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity, his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to time he blew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for, though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity, he could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity, evoke the waiter's undivided respect—so much so that, whenever the sounds of the nose reached that menial's ears, he would shake back his locks, straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire afresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened to require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee, and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him, one of those wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns, resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring; whereafter, returning with a start to consciousness, he ordered himself to be conducted to his room, flung himself at full length upon the bed, and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually, by the waiter, he, at the latter's request, inscribed a fragment of paper with his name, his surname, and his rank (for communication, in accordance with the law, to the police): and on that paper the waiter, leaning forward from the corridor, read, syllable by syllable: ""Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor—Landowner—Travelling on Private Affairs."" The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town. Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the truth, it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals. Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones; which, consisting, for the most part, of one or two storeys (added to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well), looked almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half-finished partition-walls. At other points evidence of more life and movement was to be seen, and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon boots of cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed ""Arshavski, Tailor,"" and so forth, were depicted. Over a shop containing hats and caps was written ""Vassili Thedorov, Foreigner""; while, at another spot, a signboard portrayed a billiard table and two players—the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece, even though, with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent, the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim, but succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air. Each emporium of the sort had written over it: ""This is the best establishment of its kind in the town."" Also, al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts, soap, and gingerbread (the latter but little distinguishable from the soap), and at an eating-house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed with a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the insignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now replaced, in this connection, with the laconic inscription ""Dramshop""). As for the paving of the town, it was uniformly bad.

The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be propped with oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet recently the local paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, ""Thanks to the efforts of our Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the most sultry day they afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them!""

Next, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of finding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor, should he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to inspect the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a notice affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently read it after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle, happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare. Lastly, he threw around him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in his mind the general topography of the place) and betook himself home. There, gently aided by the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his bedroom, drank a glass of tea, and, seating himself at the table, called for a candle; which having been brought him, he produced from his pocket the notice, held it close to the flame, and conned its tenour—slightly contracting his right eye as he did so. Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark. All that it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue's 6 plays would be given, and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova, while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important personages. Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful attention, and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the performance. Also, he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial Government. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding nothing there, he refolded the document, placed it in the box which served him as a receptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with a portion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.

The following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal officials—a first, and a very respectful, visit being paid to the Governor. This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in that he was neither fat nor thin. Also, he wore the riband of the order of Saint Anna about his neck, and was reported to have been recommended also for the star. For the rest, he was large and good-natured, and had a habit of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting. Next, Chichikov repaired to the Vice-Governor's, and thence to the house of the Public Prosecutor, to that of the President of the Local Council, to that of the Chief of Police, to that of the Commissioner of Taxes, and to that of the local Director of State Factories. True, the task of remembering every big-wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one; but at least our visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of paying calls, seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to the Inspector of the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City Architect. Thereafter he sat thoughtfully in his britchka—plunged in meditation on the subject of whom else it might be well to visit. However, not a single magnate had been neglected, and in conversation with his hosts he had contrived to flatter each separate one. For instance to the Governor he had hinted that a stranger, on arriving in his, the Governor's province, would conceive that he had reached Paradise, so velvety were the roads. ""Governors who appoint capable subordinates,"" had said Chichikov, ""are deserving of the most ample meed of praise."" Again, to the Chief of Police our hero had passed a most gratifying remark on the subject of the local gendarmery; while in his conversation with the Vice-Governor and the President of the Local Council (neither of whom had, as yet, risen above the rank of State Councillor) he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of addressing his interlocutors with the title of ""Your Excellency""—a blunder which had not failed to delight them. In the result the Governor had invited him to a reception the same evening, and certain other officials had followed suit by inviting him, one of them to dinner, a second to a tea-party, and so forth, and so forth.

Of himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had spoken at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed something of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that, being a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no consideration at the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had undergone many strange experiences; that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth; that he had many enemies seeking his life; and that, being desirous of rest, he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell—wherefore, having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself, he had considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief authorities of the place. This, and no more, was all that, for the moment, the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival. Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the Governor's evening party. First, however, his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two hours, and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen. That is to say, after a brief post-grandial nap he called for soap and water, and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks (which, for the purpose, he supported from within with his tongue) and then of drying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a towel which he took from the waiter's shoulder. Twice he snorted into the waiter's countenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front of the mirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs which were protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat of bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor's residence to find it illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps, a couple of gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions' cries—nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on reaching the salon, the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment, so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps, candles, and feminine apparel. Everything seemed suffused with light, and everywhere, flitting and flashing, were to be seen black coats—even as on a hot summer's day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window, and the children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons of flies, borne on the breeze, enter boldly, as though free of the house, and, taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady's sight, disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike, even though the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public, of parading up and down the sugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against one another, of cleaning their bodies under the wings, of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves, and of flying out of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons. Indeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his (the Governor's) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come from a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor excessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls, Chichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some of the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder were clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town. Also here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and distinct categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who, flitting around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were their whiskers, so presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy the manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib their French conversation as they quizzed their female companions. As for the other category, it comprised individuals who, stout, or of the same build as Chichikov (that is to say, neither very portly nor very lean), backed and sidled away from the ladies, and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the Governor's footmen had set out green tables for whist. Their features were full and plump, some of them had beards, and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in what the French call ""the devil-may-care"" style. On the contrary, their heads were either close-cropped or brushed very smooth, and their faces were round and firm. This category represented the more respectable officials of the town. In passing, I may say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren; which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the Political Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely hopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never take a back seat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit firmly, and with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat crack and bend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap, and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the case with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men amass the greater wealth. In three years' time a thin man will not have a single serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas—well, pray look at a fat man's fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban villa, and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a town, and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is to say, having served both God and the State, the stout individual has won universal respect, and will end by retiring from business, reordering his mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner—in other words, a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and luxury, and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander the same on foreign travel.

That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov's reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny. And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had already recognised several familiar faces—namely, those of the Public Prosecutor (a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink, ""Come into the next room, my friend, for I have something to say to you""—though, in the main, their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit), of the Postmaster (an insignificant-looking individual, yet a would-be wit and a philosopher), and of the President of the Local Council (a man of much amiability and good sense). These three personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance, and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong, yet a sufficiently civil, bow. Also, he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov, and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch—the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov's toes, and then begging his pardon. Next, Chichikov received an offer of a ""cut in"" at whist, and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of the head. Seating themselves at a green table, the party did not rise therefrom till supper time; and during that period all conversation between the players became hushed, as is the custom when men have given themselves up to a really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster—a talkative man by nature—had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed an expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to exclaim (if the card happened to be a queen), ""Now, old popadia 7!"" and (if the card happened to be a king), ""Now, peasant of Tambov!"" To which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted, ""Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!"" And from the neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames which participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits. I need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to quarrelling, and that in the dispute our friend joined, though so artfully as to let every one see that, in spite of the fact that he was wrangling, he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible. Never did he say outright, ""You played the wrong card at such and such a point."" No, he always employed some such phrase as, ""You permitted yourself to make a slip, and thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce."" Indeed, the better to keep in accord with his antagonists, he kept offering them his silver-enamelled snuff-box (at the bottom of which lay a couple of violets, placed there for the sake of their scent). In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch; so much so that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster rather in the shade. At the same time, certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only curiosity, but also a certain amount of sound intelligence; for he began by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed, and how their affairs happened at present to be situated, and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their standing and their families. Indeed, it was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends. In particular did Manilov—a man still in his prime, and possessed of a pair of eyes which, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed—find himself unable to make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long and fervently by the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour of visiting his country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in return Chichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere handshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend's behest, but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically: ""And do you pay ME a visit,"" and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed difficult—more especially at the present day, when the race of epic heroes is beginning to die out in Russia.

Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief of Police—a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat down to whist, and remained so seated until two o'clock in the morning. On this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a landowner named Nozdrev—a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he began to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company had no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one and the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev's tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played. The following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council, who received his guests—even though the latter included two ladies—in a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the Vice-Governor's, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor (a very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In short, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and everywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what the conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain his part in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon horse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did the company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of the most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon a prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department, instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards, on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder. Did a reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he hastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye. Did the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy—well, that was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did any one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that moment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major. Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way, a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly befitting. In a word, he was always a gentleman of excellent manners, and every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the door. Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions; the Public Prosecutor, that he was a good man of business; the Chief of Gendarmery, that he was a man of education; the President of the Local Council, that he was a man of breeding and refinement; and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery, that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing. Nay, even Sobakevitch—who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE—said to his lanky wife when, on returning late from the town, he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side: ""My dear, this evening, after dining with the Chief of Police, I went on to the Governor's, and met there, among others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow."" To this his spouse replied ""Hm!"" and then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs.

Such were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town; and these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality of his, a certain scheme of his (the reader will learn presently what it was), plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity.

Now I don't really understand what is right
If you're saying that I'm wrong and you're feeling so right
But I'm feeling so right and I think that you are wrong
So that means we're both right? and the both of us are wrong?
I don't understand life, I can't really see a light
When it's dark in my world and I'm feeling so blind
And the shine we wake up to, the things in our lives
And these things that we must do, just to survive
When you're walking downtown everybody just brush you
The industry's like a strip club too
Look at everybody on the stage and they're tryin to get paid
Make change and some are there in the game just to fuck you over
And everyone give you the cold shoulder
A loner, the people in the city really do hate
And everybody walk around with a screwface
But I'ma reach the sky, it's never too late

(verse 2)
What is really hard work? I don't know what it must be
Trust me, the unappreciated never succeed
We gotta wait so long to get a big break
See I've been breakin' my back for my city
And I'm workin my ass off, I can't even sit straight (pause)
They respect what I do but they diss me
What I do is me so it don't make sense
I didn't come in the game trying to make friends
So when I don't reply, don't get offended
And I don't get it, I don't know who my friends is
Or who my friends are, so I'm pretending
When the success starts they try to be your bestfriend
And everybody fake in there own ways
So many I can point out but I don't say
I'm on stage and my life is like a roleplay
I wanna fly but the wings already flown away
(verse 3)
They don't notice me when I'm helping everybody else
And they say I'm cocky when I wanna focus on myself
And I'm trying to make it far and I could be better off
But I'm kind and I should say my name instead of yours
I don't wanna lose and I don't need luck to win
Quit lying to yaself, you didn't do a fuckin' thing
You can't phase me, these people acting like they fuckin' made me
I been working and nobody ever paid me
Doing my thing now, making money on my own
And I'm shunning on the low, I don't care if you hate me
And I gotta home, real friends where I belong
It ain't wrong, I'm not a category where you can place me
Appreciate myself, everything that God gave me
Use it to my advantage, what I been doing lately
I do it all and nobody does it for me
Don't take it personal and no I ain't sorry

(verse 4)
I'm feeling in my zone but I'm feelin so alone
With nobody that's around me, concealing what is known
Every one of my surroundings, easily confusing me
With my race and appealing to my own
With a face that doesn't quite fit in with the community
It's hard to get hot when you're dealing with the cold
And there's no sign of unity, everybody stare you
And every song that you release, they compare you
And I'm aware too, I'm just trying to bare through
Gotta be careful, the industry will tear you
And don't be so fly without your parachute
It changed me, now I've done what I didn't dare to do
I still haven't seen money after 9 shows
I've been patient, I'm feeling like the times froze
I can't stand the world, I'd rather die slow
I'd rather die slow, and I'm so",rap

(verse 1)
Everlasting,Overlapping the average slacker
Because I practiced my tactics and mastered my passion
Rap patterns actually backwards black magic
Drastic disastrous things happen at rapid speed When the pen and the pad hits,the track gets
Automatically beat and battered till it starts
Asthma gasping then collapses in his casket,tragic!
Straight savage to the mic when I grab it
Great talent that you can feel but can't touch nor grasp it
Now lets do a little mathematics,if you add and graph the
Infinite styles ive written in while im gripping pens
Youd see im the sickest in the perimeter,not exact
Scratch that infact im the illist in this world we
Living in,for an example get an ample of your favorite
Artist and triple them,i know for certain my words will
Cripple them,irritant to them primitive simpletons
Once the mic is ripped from them this will increase
My adrenaline and ill subtract the myth from men
Like arithmetic simple isnt it?
(verse 2)
The main reason I MC is,we Mc's is a dying breed pushed to the brink of extinction
Ain't y'all tired of the force feeding of pop,it's misleading,no meaning
The industry is filled with scheming,thinking somebody like me is much needed
Already made my procedures like a genius,strategically moved my pieces,plotting out ways to sneak in the scene since the age of thirteen but
Them leeches was in disbelief when I told em I had dreams of being in the league of the most prestigious
Hopefully this critique of my technique will cease when im finished speaking
So let the king do his thing while you stroll the castle
Sit back and let my flow astound you,either love me or go down a road that's narrow
Known to hold my own in battles, I lay low in shadows
Let you explode your rounds till your low in ammo
While you reload your barrel,
Your heart is pierced with a poison tip bow and arrow
Organized yet Konfusing like Po and Pharoahe,the Prisoners of war,that came in the dark to spark the lit-e-rature,got frauds hitting the floor,i kill em for sure,rather not bust them guns but they'll lift for the cause,You kids is just soft,your delivery's off,the crowd having thoughts of ripping the chord with that pitiful talk,when im spitting my bars the crowd listens,then they sit and applaud
The ending result is you shitting your draws",rap

Let the flames consume your soul
You'll be free forever (break the chains)
It’s time to run for your life
Forget the sorrow (it’s all in your mind)

Reveal the way out after the rain (break the chains)
We will overcome and rise
Don’t let the rage burn in your eyes

We've got our hands tied (no place to hide)
The holy is compared to death
Let the flames consume your soul
You'll be free forever (break the chains)

1194,"When I met Anna, she could charm
But I, myself impregnable
Thought myself immune to it
The words she spoke and things she did

I was unimpressed to say the least

And Michael was a friend of mine
With eyes so wide but not too bright
When Anna, she came into play
She chewed him up, then walked away

I rolled my my eyes, I'd heard before
To expect these things from those like her

So I called her my friend Anna
At arm's length from my friend, Anna
I was only something new to her

I graduated, left the state
And Anna, she could just not wait
To travel north to visit me
I barred the door romantically
And I felt so prepared to see her face

And in one night I'd never seen
So many men fall to their knees
And Anna, all the cause of it
The words she spoke, the things she did

To put me firm beneath her thumb
But damned if I'd be overcome

So I turned away from Anna
No goodnight to my friend Anna
By the time that I awoke, she had deserted me

The next time that I'd see her face
After a year, her wedding day
The groom a man near twice her age
Their child only months away

I saved the date begrudgingly

When Anna came to speak to me
I couldn't take her seriously
She asked if we could Keep In Touch
She'd said the same to everyone
It seemed like something she would do
What a strange thing when she followed through

So I'd say hello to Anna
Once a day to my friend Anna
It was mostly just to pass the time

Who's to say
Why anyone's inclined to tell a story
Surely there's a reason Anna would have been the one anointed
Center in the grandest scheme
When I can't discern what she means in it

And that's how I think of Anna
Nothing more than my friend, Anna
When her husband called, what a surprise

He told me she had taken sick
With slim chance of recovering
The way she talked, it seemed to him
That I could be her only friend

It would mean the world to see your face

I took a cab reluctantly
And told the driver wait for me
Approached their door, I feel the weight
Before I knock, I hesitate
And I had no desire to force a smile
To know her illness, meet her child
So I left her porch, I turned my back
And hurried back into the cab

I turned away from Anna
No goodbye to my friend Anna
Not a phone call or a note from her again

So I turned away from Anna
No goodbye to my friend Anna
I sing the story of a girl, completed",rock

One time for your mind, yes y'all it's the T.A

Put that K. double O. L. High on replay
Unlike airlines, we fly with no delay
Non stop hip hop, can't cop on Ebay
So ready or not, yo you can't knock what we play
We make it rain when we run together
So you can come stand under my umbrella
I am here At Last like a song from Etta
Had to take my time, get my shit together
So y'all can stop buggin' me like Citronella
Got my Salt and my Pepa like Spinderella
Now my flavor's just right like grits with cheddar
It's that down south sweet tea, truth ya never

Their eyes can not hide their pain

I rise above the clouds

And guide me through the night

Far beyond the grave where I belong

Abandon my own kin
A haunting fear to leave them all
From the bud to the height
A new role for me to play

Fade the echoes of sombre years
Buried the guilt I wouldn't see
I once was the captive of my own game
Making the tears of the damned souls run

Steeped in fiction, the embryo grew
Until the evil mark slowly declined
The waning confusion has led up to bloom
Now I feel you I’ll lead you
I abought my sins
For my eternal glory
Follow my steps
Along this inner journey

Oh shine a light around me
Eyes open wide
Find peace and serenity

I abought my sins
For my eternal glory
Follow my steps
Along this inner journey

It's coming to take me away
I'm dreaming
The boat is ascending, it's ending

This world of misery
Fades from my memory
This life of purity
Will last an eternity

So, wake me and shake me when its over in Chicago
Paris, Rome
Boston
Ann Arbor, Bloomington
Down in New Orleans they're just gonna party, party
I've still got friends in Denver and Cheyenne and all over the world

I never get to see them anymore
What happened to them?
Seems like they all just drifted away
I look in my phone book and I see their names but its been years since I've called them up
All I see now are strangers that are walking down the street staring down at the sidewalk
They never look up and when they do they just look away
What about all those people
They go to their jobs every day
And go home to their houses
Watch a little TV
Say goodnight Gracie",rock

Control an evolutionary masterpiece that was billions of years in the making called a human?

Would you like to hear a race of beings that actually think Earth belongs to them?

The far corners of the universe
In search of intelligent life

No, no!

You must keep a move on my friend
Come stop on in
If you would like to feel
A thrill
Down your spine!

We have that men truly believe they are superior to women
We have people who kill animals with military-grade weapons
That call themselves hunters and deem it a sport!

Ha, that’s right!
Right here!
I kid you not, it is one bizarre gallery we have here, I assure you
Boy we got it all here
I wish I could say these were fake creations coming from my carnie mouth …
But sadly this is all real
Right, now this is just the tip of the iceberg here, why don’t you come swing on by
Swing on by and see for yourself, the Gallery of Thrills

Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish you Martians would just beam me up
I would feel more safe in the unknown than what is known here",rock

Handle the ball like its a magic trick

First was a rookie
Score like a bookie
Lead the league in steals it's cookies

Try to foul me Hit with a penalty
Cooking players up with a first class recipe

Fouled at the line still and one
Odds were against me still I've won

With the Shot clock counting down
Sprinting 100 for the touchdown

Got to triple team me
Seems y'all can't beat me
Pay off the refs So y'all try to cheat me
Home run hitter 4th string batter
Set a new records that's been shattered

Take it up the paint
With little restraint
Passing out L's to their complaints

Line them up Kick up my field goals
Breaking these records I'm on a roll

Critics out here the Commentating
Proving them wrong is motivating

Slay my rivals with that triple play
I Do the impossible it's too cray

No one deserves it more than me

Championship claim what's mine

Stole the win with an Interception
Saw through the play with clear perception
These teams out here no competition
Making headlines recognition

Haters talking from the bleachers
Scraping teams my top procedure
Beast mode with the Triple double
As of now I'm on a different level

Hit the fast break
With the shake & bake
Every year new records I make

Quick on my feet
With the quarterback sneak
Intend to keep my winning streak

One of the greatest to play the Game
Legacy on the hall of fame

Elevated game progression

Katharine, you're still in the East Village

You showed me that my fate wasn't in Texas
Haven't seen you since Times Square was a zoo years ago

You always said I changed you when we met
You grew up in a college town, I was an army brat
New to your high school, I didn't have friends
You were in student council, you drove a convertible

You shed your highlights and your highlighted friends
We didn't go to football games, we took long drives instead
Change was inside you and I got the credit
You flew off to fashion school and I soon followed you

I got a mind that's more sick than aged sticky fromage
This asylum's harder to escape from than a tricky garage
It's driving people crazier than Nicki Minaj
My chick so bad she tried to kill me in my sleep
People say I'm like a stalker, but really I'm a creep
More dudes say I'm crazy, less dudes say I'm psycho
It's Halloween, baby, and guess who's playing Michael
Unless you get the cycle, don't try to understand me
Call me by my first name like I'm Dakota Fanning
They say I'm so demanding, the fans, that is
I got people working for me saying damn, that's it
Every time I give an order, cause I go easy on them
The boogeyman is blessed like I keep sneezing on them
The prince still runs his mouth
Although you'd think S. Beezy shot him
But I think it's too late, damn Sleezy got him

And I don't like to use guns and explosives
Every rapper that sees us runs if he knows us
Get used to me, I'm sick and I'm demented
(I thought he was classy) nope, I just pretended
I say the things I say for you to smile and I meant it
To the point that it would be offensive just to be offended
My rhymes are so splendid, man, they're fat like they're obese
They're gangsta, low tees, gold teeth, and goatees
With punchlines for homies, I bear arms like no sleeves
You say you want no beef with me, ho please

6904,"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States--she's around here somewhere: I have come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great Chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here.

I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others, and rightly so. If you haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has: a friend, a neighbor, a member of your family. You don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It's the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It's the job you thought you'd retire from but now have lost, the business you built your dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread, the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere.

But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.

The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this Nation. The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They exist in our laboratories and our universities, in our fields and our factories, in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history, we still possess in ample measure. What is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and take responsibility for our future once more.

Now, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities as a Government or as a people. I say this not to lay blame or to look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament.

The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight, nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy, yet we import more oil today than ever before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our Government, than ever before.

In other words, we have lived through an era where too often short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity, where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People bought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time, on some other day. Well, that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here.

Now is the time to act boldly and wisely to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is the time to jump-start job creation, restart lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that is what I'd like to talk to you about tonight. It's an agenda that begins with jobs.

As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery plan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets, not because I believe in bigger Government--I don't--not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've inherited--I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardship. In fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. And that's why I pushed for quick action. And tonight I am grateful that this Congress delivered and pleased to say that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.

Over the next 2 years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs. More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private sector: jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges, constructing wind turbines and solar panels, laying broadband and expanding mass transit.

Because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids, health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of Minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make. Because of this plan, 95 percent of working households in America will receive a tax cut; a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on April 1st. Because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all 4 years of college, and Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm.
Now, I know there are some in this Chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work, and I understand that skepticism. Here in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.

And that's why I've asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort; because nobody messes with Joe. I--am I right? They don't mess with him. I have told each of my Cabinet, as well as mayors and Governors across the country, that they will be held accountable by me and the American people for every dollar they spend. I've appointed a proven and aggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. And we have created a new web site called recovery.gov, so that every American can find out how and where their money is being spent.

So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.

I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every American should know that it directly affects you and your family's well-being. You should also know that the money you've deposited in banks across the country is safe, your insurance is secure, you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. That's not the source of concern. The concern is that if we do not restart lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins.

You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education, how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.

But credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. And with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or even to each other. And when there is no lending, families can't afford to buy homes or cars, so businesses are forced to make layoffs. Our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further. That is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, to restore confidence, and restart lending. And we will do so in several ways.

First, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small-business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running.

Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling with declining home values; Americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped to bring about. In fact, the average family who refinances today can save nearly $2,000 per year on their mortgage.

Third, we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to ensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy.

Now, I understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted by an approach that gives bank bailouts with no strings attached and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. But such an approach won't solve the problem, and our goal is to quicken the day when we restart lending to the American people and American business and end this crisis once and for all.

And I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This time, CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.

Still, this plan will require significant resources from the Federal Government--and, yes, probably more than we've already set aside. But while the cost of action will be great, I can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.

Now, I understand that when the last administration asked this Congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and the results that followed. So were the American taxpayers; so was I. So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. I promise you, I get it.
But I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment. My job--our job is to solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. I will not send--I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can't get a mortgage. That's what this is about. It's not about helping banks; it's about helping people. [Applause]

It's not about helping banks; it's about helping people. Because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire workers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend. And if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car or open their own business. Investors will return to the market, and American families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly but surely, confidence will return and our economy will recover.

So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary, because we cannot consign our Nation to an open-ended recession. And to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new, commonsense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes shortcuts and abuse.

The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we're taking to revive our economy in the short term. But the only way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way this century will be another American century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care, the schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.

In the next few days, I will submit a budget to Congress. So often, we've come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or a laundry list of programs. I see this document differently. I see it as a vision for America, as a blueprint for our future.

My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited, a trillion-dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession. Given these realities, everyone in this Chamber, Democrats and Republicans, will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. And that includes me. But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves, that says Government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.

For history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this Nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of Civil War, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. In the wake of war and depression, the GI bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle class in history. And a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the Moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world. In each case, Government didn't supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.

We are a nation that has seen promise amid peril and claimed opportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again, and that is why, even as it cuts back on programs we don't need, the budget I submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education.

It begins with energy. We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in Korea. Well, I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders, and I know you don't either. It is time for America to lead again.

Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this Nation's supply of renewable energy in the next 3 years. We've also made the largest investment in basic research funding in American history, an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy but breakthroughs in medicine and science and technology.

We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will put Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.

But to truly transform our economy, to protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask this Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in America. That's what we need. And to support that innovation, we will invest $15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power, advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America.

Speaking of our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decisionmaking and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. But we are committed to the goal of a retooled, reimagined auto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it; scores of communities depend on it. And I believe the Nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it.
Now, none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this is America. We don't do what's easy. We do what's necessary to move this country forward.

And for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care. This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes. In the last 8 years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. And in each of these years, 1 million more Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. And it's one of the largest and fastest growing parts of our budget. Given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold. We can't afford to do it. It's time.

Already, we've done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last 30 days than we've done in the last decade. When it was days old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full time. Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records, a new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American, including me, by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control.

This budget builds on these reforms. It includes a historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform, a down payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every American. It's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. And it's a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.

Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that's why I'm bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans to begin work on this issue next week.

I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. Once again, it will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and our conscience long enough. So let there be no doubt: Health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.

The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in America. In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity, it is a prerequisite. Right now, three-quarters of the fastest growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation, and half of the students who begin college never finish.

This is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will outcompete us tomorrow. That is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education, from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. That is a promise we have to make to the children of America.

Already, we've made historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. We've dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. We've made college affordable for nearly 7 million more students--7 million. And we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress.

But we know that our schools don't just need more resources, they need more reform. And that is why this budget creates new teachers--new incentives for teacher performance, pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. We'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps, and we will expand our commitment to charter schools.

It is our responsibility as lawmakers and as educators to make this system work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. So tonight I ask every American to commit to at least 1 year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a 4-year school, vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma.

And dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American. That's why we will support--we will provide the support necessary for all young Americans to complete college and meet a new goal. By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is a goal we can meet. That's a goal we can meet.

Now, I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, I ask Congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch, as well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country, Senator Edward Kennedy.

These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children, but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a parent, for a mother or father who will attend those parent-teacher conferences or help with homework or turn off the TV, put away the video games, read to their child. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father, when I say that responsibility for our children's education must begin at home. That is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue; that's an American issue.

There is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. And that's the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. That is critical. [Applause] I agree, absolutely. See, I know we can get some consensus in here. [Laughter] With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down. That is critical.

Now, I'm proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities.

And yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. My administration has also begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. But we have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade.

In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and end direct payments to large agribusiness that don't need them. We'll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq and reform our defense budget so that we're not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste and fraud and abuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any healthier. We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our Tax Code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas.

In order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Now, let me be clear--let me be absolutely clear, because I know you'll end up hearing some of the same claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: If your family earns less than $250,000 a year, a quarter million dollars a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: Not one single dime. In fact--not a dime--in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut--that's right, a tax cut--for 95 percent of working families. And by the way, these checks are on the way.

Now, to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come. And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.

Finally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules. And for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For 7 years, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.

Along with our outstanding national security team, I'm now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will soon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war.

And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat Al Qaida and combat extremism, because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it.

As we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, Americans are united in sending one message: We honor your service; we are inspired by your sacrifice; and you have our unyielding support.

To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned.

To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend, because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of America. And that is why I have ordered the closing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists. Because living our values doesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And that is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture. We can make that commitment here tonight.

In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America. We cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.

To seek progress towards a secure and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To meet the challenges of the 21st century--from terrorism to nuclear proliferation, from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty--we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power.

And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the world depends on us having a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world's.

As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us, watching to see what we do with this moment, waiting for us to lead. Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege, one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. For in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill.

I know that it's easy to lose sight of this truth, to become cynical and doubtful, consumed with the petty and the trivial. But in my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places, that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of ordinary Americans who are anything but ordinary.

I think of Leonard Abess, a bank president from Miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. He didn't tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, ""I knew some of these people since I was 7 years old. It didn't feel right getting the money myself.""

I think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community, how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. ""The tragedy was terrible,"" said one of the men who helped them rebuild. ""But the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.""

I think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I visited in Dillon, South Carolina, a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. She had been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this Chamber. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The letter asks us for help and says: ""We are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, Congressmen like yourself, and one day President, so we can make a change to not just the State of South Carolina, but also the world. We are not quitters."" That's what she said: ""We are not quitters.""

These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres, a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity. Their resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our cause. And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us.

I know--look, I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far. [Laughter] There are surely times in the future where we will part ways. But I also know that every American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. I know that. That must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months and where we return after those debates are done. That is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build common ground.

And if we do, if we come together and lift this Nation from the depths of this crisis, if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity, if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very Chamber, ""something worthy to be remembered.""

Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.",misc

This telecast is now under my control
And now that I have the chance to say what's on my mind
Let me tell you tales untold

For 30 years I've worked here at this TV station
In an editing room no one has ever seen
Inserting laughter after every punchline
And gasping after every scream

But now I want you to give me back
The years that I have wasted
Staring at these television screens
And now that I have your attention
Let me show you what I mean
Because I remember back when I was in high school
I never thought I'd stoop so low
I thought I'd be the guy on unmasking the clown
Not the guy out polishing his nose

The essentialist arguments are in essence essential. Serve to divide the whole, a part is easier to take our eyes fixed on the horizon, hope for something better through a tear blurred vision gaze. There has to be something better, we are eroded by rivers and carried out to the sea. Suffered by our ignorance, got to fix this social scene; listened to the clowns for so long that now it all sounds the same.

Because humans are just like a handful of seeds
It’s hard to tell which ones will grow into trees and which ones will blossom into weeds
Our minds are born empty, with wants and needs searching for answers to who we might be
Searching the earth, mountains and seas, searching
But life's roads hold no compass rose
Too busy becoming stars to tell them apart
Hoping that going north is the same as following my heart

Through books, radio and TV
I’m searching hoping that I find my identity

Let's all get lifted
Split the swisher, quickly twist us up a fatty
Now, I've been smokin' out all day long
P.O.'d in the back of Krayzie's Caddy
How in the world did I manage to smoke this many?
About a hundred, man. Feel it all in my stomach
To the brain severely blunted
And it ain't no shame off in my game
Hydroponics and Indonesia
Even the stress sometimes be creeper
So pass me some reefer, want to receive, ah
Little Lay, givin' you what you need
Nothin' but the best green leaves
With a pocket full of cheese, gettin' P.O.D

I be so high, feel high. Forgive me Lord
But I feel like the weed be blessin' my soul
Got to smoke that sticky, smelly stuff
But I just can't get enough
Smoke it, hit it, pass it to the next man
Let him choke, smoke but don't hold on
Don't hold on, on. No, no
And if you smoke it with me, yeah
Then, I'm a smoke it with you
Y'all, we can smoke it all up
We can smoke and get ba-

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone + Krayzie Bone]
P.O.D.'ded that'll get me in my seat
Hennessy and I ain't too young to be that poetically
Here to believe that I get brave, and all on my way
In a daze, me puff puff on my reef
Got a blunt for the thugs and hustlas
Ain't no bustas in the Mo Thug game
And it gets me out of all miseries
Follow the benefits, stay in place
As long as we reach, put up the fist and flip and pray
I'll be done, when I reach my own
Stay free; let the time go pass me by
Stay high, I'm P.O.D.'d. (P.O.D.'d)
I smoke on nothin' but the best of buddah
Ooh, yeah. Get the blunts and weed
Fuck the Hennessy; let's focus on these leaves
Reefer really relax my mind
And ask me one more time
Get a split up, keep it lit up. Can you feel us?
Get with us, smoke with your nigga
Somebody told me, you better
Respect the sticky leaves, sticky leaves, sticky leaves

To enslave some dreams into her black heart
Damnation, seduction, you fall under her spell
Conjuring she opens the gateway of hell

She conduct the dark shapes through ritual
Her chants are likе serenade for thе wolves

Horror demons fly at labyrinth of the woods
The full moon witnesses the curse

Abyssal winds blow through this darkest night
The naked Silhouetted of Lilith revealed the sign
The sorceress is penetrated by the shadows
Crawling beings join to the crows
The trees now tell forgotten tales
She whispers terrible blasphemies
And when sky grows dark and the wolves howl
The old witch fornicates with all that is alive

Dark clouds loom on the horizon
She walks naked through freezing fog

The witch lives and can't die
And now all the heaven cries
In the face of this terror that walks between us

You look so excited
I wish you tried to hide it

When can I visit?
Think I may have missed it

I know that all I do is whine
But could you try to love me?

You know I don’t have much to do

I don’t agree

Why don’t you listen to me?

Is that people may talk smack
Spread rumors like the bitches they are
Showing that they’re never gonna go far
This hasn’t happened yet so why must I fret
If your honest people don’t disrespect
That’s what I’ve found during my time in this world
I really wanna go around without all these strings
I’m not the puppet I’m the master of these things
My choices, my actions, my life
I must deal with the aftermath
I’m not that good at math
I should get a tutor to fix that

I’ve tried different things
Learned from them too
That's the way we grow into something new

Finally found someone to whom I can relate

Walked away and then never looked back

At the hands, innocent lives
At the hands of a sick fucking monster
Trapped within a godless void

Happy birthday Country Joe
I resolve to do like I always do
There's an overweight man with an overweight woman on a sofa just watching tv
Hes yelling his opinion at the television she looks up from her food and agrees
They got two bumper stickers on their pick-up truck
They keep the pick-up parked outside
One sticker says ""what would jesus do?""
The other bumper sticker says ""power of pride""
I was thumbing through the stations on my own television
When I came across a guy on the religious station
Singing ""Somebody's Coming"" sounding whiter than me somehow
Wow
It took me back in time through dwindling joy
To when i was such a guilt-ridden catholic boy
I'm Evangelical Agnostic now

I don't know what we're doing here
You don't ""KNOW"" what were doing here
Now Christians don't walk out on me just yet
You know whose name I'll be yelling as I'm clutching my chest
The one my dad told me to and his told him to
And I probably pray as much or more than you do
Believe? Shit, every word i sing
But believing and knowing, those are two different things
And if you're trying to change the way a stranger's life will have to go
I believe this is where I wanna stick to what I know
Which is nothing you know, nothing for sure so
Just chill 'til the next episode
Now back to the lecture at hand
Seems like my neighbor wants to kill what he can't understand
I say we can't just kill what we don't understand
But i turn on my tv and see that, oh yes we can
We can and we have since then dawn of man
For countless gods whose only real seeming plan
Was to see to it that clinging to life was our fate
And you gotta admit that life's pretty great
But
Can we deny that its killing us?
I'll be here all week
Happy New Year everybody
Happy birthday Country Joe
I resolve to do like I always do
I ain't hurtin you
If life is anything it's embarrassing
A rusty nail through a careless shoe
You can't help but sit around and wonder sometimes
Why there's never anything the poor nail can do
Or think about how unfair it is
That the shoe is only going where it has to too
If you ain't the dumb kid out running around

Dedication I gotta commit to making it outta
The hometown and going round the map
Put the whole state all on my back
But who wants to be the one watching it?
Everybody wanna run and be the boss of shit
But what I want defines how I'm living
What I'm on defines how I'm feeling
Lots of smoke to clear my head
Eyes low they might appear as red
But I don't care I'm only focused

I promise to kill it

Bad bitch lookin' like a Playboy bunny
I'ma slide through, be her Playboy buddy
If just last year, she ain't want nun from me
Then tell me why I'm in bedroom, bussin' nuts on her tummy
Whisper in my ear that she think she love me
But I don't give a fuck, gotta go get money
Left her ass lookin' like a Playboy dummy
And I'm onto the next, I'm a Playboy buddy

[VERSE 1]
Walked up on the scene, nah, I meant rolled up on a bean
Mouth was dry from the doobies so to the drinks I shall proceed
Pick myself up a nice cold bottle; 40 oz. O.E
Then look over at the crowd and guеss what I see
Bad biddie and she pretty, shе rollin a fat blunt
Lookin' at me with those eyes that yell out, ""Let's have fun""
But I only came to chill for a bit then I gotta run
Money callin' on my phone an I'm tryna stack racks up
She like how I drip
Guess she diggin' my fashion
I got hella grip
And she got hella ass, and
She don't want no money
She just want a little lovin'
I'ma slide through to her crib and lay the pipe like I be plumbin'
The way she be workin' that thing- ooh, got me bussin
Got her drippin' everywhere, I give her good dick and she love it
When she suckin' got me thinking that there ain;t no bitch above her
Contemplating whether or not she can be my baby mother, but
I know that she only fuck with me because she want some
I get some and pass her the keys to her whip, her job's done
Go home, post a booty pic, my lyrics in her caption
But I ain't gonna like that shit 'cause I already had fun
[HOOK]
Got my bag up, she think I'm wylin', I don't give a fuck
It takes hard work and dedication to build up from nun
I'm really 'bout a bag, all I really want are my funds
Don't give a fuck about a bitch that ain't shit but a dumb-

[Chorus]
Bad bitch lookin' like a Playboy bunny
I'ma slide through, be her Playboy buddy
If just last year, she ain't want nun from me
Then tell me why I'm in bedroom, bussin' nuts on her tummy

My heart is dying and I know
That I’m the only one to blame

Calling out to you, ‘please save me’
But when you ask me for my trust
I hesitate and turn away

Can we still hope that a blessing will save us?
Or are we alone as this tragedy unfolds?
All of the feelings – they echo, repeating


Every scream of bitterness, of pain and anger
I’ll wield them all, the BLOOD TELLER


I don’t wanna cry, so I don’t want to see you again
But our love will bring me back to you, in the end
Never let me go, I’ll bear the pain if only you’ll stay


I’ll wait for you
No matter what they say!



Are we in the future? Or only in a dream?
Where are the answers that we seek?

This door that’s before me is testing all we know – so do I break it or let go?
I don’t know …

The words you’re used to preaching
Come far too late to reach me now
I’m better when I’m on my own

You ask me how I’m feeling
You want to take me far away

But I’m not sure I want to go …

What do we know? Our reason is failing us
Fearful you go, running off to the unknown

Holding you close now, I’ll try to forgive how
All the grief, impatience – all the pain and anger
Has turned me into BLOOD TELLER
I don’t want your touch, it’s cold, but I can’t see you again
‘Cuz I know that you’re just gonna leave in the end
Come be my side, ask questions, and reach out for my touch
In this embrace
There’s no one here but us!

Is my wish the future? Will I fulfill my dreams?
Where are the answers that we seek?

This door that’s before me is asking what we want – whether I break it or give up
I’ve lost heaven …

I wanna stay … I wanna be the blood foreigner
Disappear! You traitor, I don’t want to be hurt
But I wanna live, repeating like a Blood Alien
Just go to sleep, you can’t turn back or run

I don’t wanna cry, so I don’t want to see you again
But our love will bring me back to you, in the end

Come be my side, ask questions, and reach out for my touch
In this embrace
There’s no one here but us!

Are we in the future? Or only in a dream?
Where are the answers that we seek?
This door that’s before me is testing all we know – so do I break it or let go?

Yo, I was born to kill so here I am boy
I'm talking blood for real, it's not a paintball
I'm talking flamethrowers, I'm talking chainsaw
Baseball bats beautifully stacked in the Range Rov'
When I say kill - I mean lyrically
All I need is a pencil, like Heath 'how 'bout a magic trick?'
Piece of paper, a beat, few verbs, and adjectives
Got 'em thinking ''oh shit'' like it's a laxative
Oh oh, doctor said I shouldn't smoke
So I beat the shit out of him with his stethoscope hah
Pass you the microphone? (huh?) fuck are you talking 'bout?
Time is money, I roll up just to slow it down
I don't chicken out, watch me kick the facts
Pandora's box, knock-knock don't make me open up
You best be hopin' that it don't provoke me bad enough
To wreak havoc shit, I can almost feel the rage in my abdomen
So sayonara friend I ain't gon pretend
Like I'm the best who ever did it but I'm up for debates
I'm finally awake, melatonin finally got on my nerves
After i mumbled in my sleep & threw up on my bed
Fuck that, this is duel to the death bitch ''En garde''
Come against me, might as well lay down flat in the black bag
Muscle relaxers, don't need 'em the way I spaz out
Sippin' Corona by the liters, but fuck a dust mask
Hazmat suit, I'm wondering where the ass at (haha)
She heavy breathing on the reg but it ain't cuz of asthma
I'm so fly motherfucker, yeah I'm sky high
My last will will probably be extracted out of the black box
Scrap that Drake, that's definitely not hip hop (nope)
Serenading the game delicately like Phil Ochs (huh?)
With all your whips & Versace silver flip flops
I wonder what you kiss-asses do for a living? Rim jobs?
All jokes aside tho, try to outflow my flow
Lyrics people would die for, free of charge on your smartphone
Bygones be bygones, icons still hold micro-
Phones like Daisho, stabbing your eyeballs and chopping your nuts off
The beat needs liposuction cause it's so fat

I been keepin it Malaysian, stay so fly they lost the plane (whoa!)
I’m that Wall Street baker, how I’m rollin out the dough
I’m that big call maker, it’s just something you should know
When the world gives you lemons
Squeeze it out and mix with rum
Hustle up to set up shop, now watch da money come
Oh let’s go (oh, oh, oh)
They say money in the grave
If that’s the case, then my coffin stayin paid

Turned pipe-paper dreams into income streams
Cuz money is like water, some slips through they hands
Others cup it up, and keep on stackin bands
Me I own that faucet, I can floss it, left it ran (whoa!)

You can make it sprinkle, little shower o’ the rain
Just know I plug it up and to my bank account it drains
So you can throw it up and make it rain on your fans
I’ll keep it one-hundred, and add to my grands (ooh)
Don’t delude, this a deluge, splashin green juice
I’m talkin’ big money, big money, big money huge
They say money can’t make you happy
It’s more bout what you do
While that’s true, this ain’t greed
But the green ain’t made me blue (oohh!)
Basement to the penthouse, money can change your views
Everywhere I look now is green, green, green money hues!

[Chorus: HiiQ]
My black don’t fade
Run these colors on the way
Oh, Renegades
Run a 100 on the gauge
Swimmin in the money, if you float you stay the same
If you wanna get this dough, then you gotta play the game
So let’s go (oh, oh, oh)
Money in the way
So let’s go (oh, oh, oh)
Money in the way
To hit that money stroke
Yeah sometimes it pays to wade
Got your bitch passin out
When she see how much I’m paid
So let’s go
[Verse 2: Bars]
First we started with stacks then we hit em wit racks yea we stackin them dollars
Plenty cheddar coming like tax, catch me shopping off sax, cuz I’m banking with commas
Yeah we running train on these tracks, on a plane here to lax, but the money’s no problem
Sick with the flow you can’t catch, got the green you can’t match, and I put that on my mama (yuh)

Make ten spend two save eight it’s easy
Don’t approach me dawg make me uneasy
Big drip on me might need a squeegee
She need bikini, can’t see me Stevie
I’m on my bullshit please believe me
Brown boy got green something like kiwi
Stacks out this world I bank with E.T
I’m different specie, pockets they beefy

My therapist said I need a shrink
Cuz all I see is furs and minks
Way I stack paper need a Brinks
Make all my haters doublethink
Endorsing checks pass me the ink
My sprite in color something pink
Don’t judge me dawg Molly made drinks
Plus the boy got bands just like NSYNC

Crew deep round of shots on me I say it’s whatever
Shawty in the club lonely but she leave with me cuz I got that cheddar
QB making plays on three I got eyes on me so I tote that metal
Sage told me go in OD cuz the money in the way took it up another level (yeah)
[Chorus: HiiQ]
My black don’t fade
Run these colors on the way
Oh, Renegades
Run a 100 on the gauge

Indulging in the act and just letting his mind roam
A lifeboat in the eye of a cyclone, just another freak of nature that's living the sideshow
When it's primal in the instincts, survival of the fittest
We're segregated gene pools divided by religion
I know that no one makes you in the likeness of their image
When accumulated lies like proprietary business
So many unforgiven too many underprivileged

My heart has lost its way
Like I don't know what to say
Everything I made I pave my way
Smoke this haze, take these Percocet's
Bitches give me headaches
I got to get away, I got to find a way
So I'm in love for the first time
Aye, now they all could make me see or make me blind
You'd still be ill I'm always Hil
Its always real, and drugs are gonna kill me

For a reason waiting for this song
If they don't love me then they'll lеave me wherе I stand
If they don't love me then they'll leave me like the man, aye

Here's the unreal we can make it there
They don't wanna feel so they take us there
If you feel the pain you shouldn't feel a thing
That explains why there's morphine in my veins
There I go love, it seems impossible
They don't know these drugs or take these obstacles
This is limo life take it if its right
2 doses, think I'll get some sleep tonight, finally

Just a chip off the block, or boulder with the will to rock
Good days, didn't stop, taught to, live a lot
Some mistakes have shown me what isn't hot, others hit the spot
Here's something fresh for the kids to adopt
Resolution's high-def, but the picture's cropped
Read a whole book yet, miss the plot?
Widen screens, give things a shot, wing it from the top
Thinking in spirals, just to get outside of this box
And I'll run in place if that's what it takes to keep my blood moving
Compare pens and markers, before I draw conclusions, and
What a wonderful world when it's in union
I like to see yous grin, 'cause I'm a humanist, little humorous
Came to warm this mother up, if you're cool with it
Used to quit, then I got schooled a bit
My potential's too legit, I see through the mist, and the view is tits
If what I'm doing fits, then choose to commit

All that this resembles, yo, yo, peep the kid's credentials

First, buy yourself, own your own movement
Second (second) master what's inside your toolkit, student
Play the con, like, ""You prolly won't do it,"" show-and-prove shit
A cardiopen nudist on that old-newness
Do my best to embody that, knowledge facts
Make marks that aren't on the map, I could add some info to an almanac
First-handed, I discover how I'm setting trends
Second, check check what I heard from others recommend

You dont need to fear you're my number one, me and you till the end when we're all gone",rap

Written in the faces, step
To the rhythm of the way we get, blue
With that worry in the naked morning

And there's summin' in the way those elephant carpets fiddle with the new hearts

And there's summin' in the way it laughs
There's something in the way it laughs
And there's summin' in the way our touches are caught
By a voyeur-ish gaze and a sticky scroll-down through the history bar
And there's something in the way our eyes, our eyes stopped meeting

Something in the way so I, I, can't feel it

A whole bunch of sevens
They're coming in now
And there's a lot of them
And down the chimney too

I bet they want some cake
""We want cake! Where's our cake?""
My house is full of sevens
They're filling up the living room
Sliding down the banister
Talking on the telephone
Inviting over more sevens
(""It's the green house at the end of the block"")
I'm running out of cake
""We want cake! Where's our cake?""

My house is full of sevens
""We want cake! Where's our cake?""

This is straight from the heart call me MC artery
Thinking bout some real shit eyes looking watery
Never let them leak though, Denver’s like a freak show
2 shots fired out my window like some free throws
I’m tired of feeling poor, I’m tired of eating ramen
I’m tired of all the war, propaganda, and bombing
When I’m broke I’m frustrated, when I’m broke I wanna drink
When I’m broke I can’t think, I just want to rob a bank
I’m trying to keep it positive, I’m writing out my honesty
I’m a rare thing to rap, like monogamy and modesty
What’s a pyramid to a mountain? An ocean to a fountain
How many lies have I told, I don’t know I stopped counting
I’m real like dirty dishes in the sink for 2 days
You fake like a CEO's smile and a toupee
My thoughts are deep cause I came from the bottom
If you have dreams you should chase them if you got em

[Hook: Time]
If you work everyday break the state
If you don't make a living wage break the state
If everyday there's more debt break the state
If they arrest you at the protest break the state
If there's drones over your home break the state
If they foreclose on your loan break the state
If you want to make change, break the state
We got to break the state, before it's too late
[Verse 2: Time]
I am not a commie, I'm awake, I'm a realist
I am a truthist, an anti-imperialist
I am not perfect, come make mistakes with me
I think my phone's tapped, the NSA is chasing me
I was born in America, land of paranoia
Where if you fight the state, propaganda will destroy ya
Kids join the army for their educational goals
But doesn't killing others uneducate the soul?
The elite eat caviar as bodies explode
And like a sweatshop they don't reap what they sew
The state is homophobic cause the state is religious
That's why they used the bible to slaughter the indigenous
It ain't man vs. nature, it's money vs. everything
Greed gave Mother Nature a radioactive wedding ring
Old mother's dying we're almost out of time
So watch me disappear like Palestine

If you work everyday break the state
If you don't make a living wage break the state
If everyday there's more debt break the state

If voting changed anything it would be illegal
Word to Emma Goldman don't vote for lesser evils
It's not an election it's just an auction
The winner goes to the corporation that bought them
Politics is in the streets, vote with a protest
Occupy rap, pedagogy of the oppressed
Provocateurs everywhere I've seen it more than once
But like Oscar said true friends stab you in the front
I don't eat death so I don't eat meat
But there's suicide genes in the soy and the wheat
Break the state and don't replace it with another one
Cause the president's just an ego with another gun
I'm not preaching or whining I'm talking about apocalypse
Put your faith in you, not theatrical politics
This ain't man vs. god or man vs. machine
The real enemy is us the nature of human beings",rap

On the deathbed
When angels come take
“Souls to valhalla”
My generation, until then
No regrets, bet?
God forgive us
We sin till sunset with a smile on our face
Success fore death is the main quest, still no results
Sun is the same but Im older
Awake one day carrying wrinkles on my neck
Next thing i'm on my deathbed
Angels coming to take
“Rohi ala al jannah”
Or sleep is the cousin of death no great beyond
No matter your beliefs
Mother nature the soul seller spoke
Said valuable life is sold really cheap
Could be gone at any given moment
Once bought no refunds, no returns, and stairs to the heavens too steep
Can't come back down nor can the atheist awake from eternal sleep
I goes in deep
Details I seek
Pay attention
You see
Big bang blasts made a cosmos so damn vast
The stats; Ten to the power of two, six, eight, five
Zero zero zero, accurate stat of you being alive
Centuries passed ,Through that
Our ancestors evolved and survived till you've arrived
But there's one rule, kendrick spoke it on to pimp a butterfly
Fittest adapt and last, shit won't change til you get up and wash your ass
You got one chance, time to put on your big boy pants
Can't be afraid of judgment and put my livelihood on a budget
If I ever felt anyone judging
I would draw a mental picture within that moment that I'm staring at earth
To imagine the silence of the vacuum and how small we would all seem, rarest form of birth
Re-enter reality but this time the city turned rural people morphed to sheep
Told myself I'm a belgian shepherd with wings, I must break free
So I turned the other cheek put a beat on repeat
Till my pen game was made sharper
Till my joints got harder
It toughened my bones
Everytime I fell the ground felt softer
I guess i'm too close to comfort
The truth is where discomfort lies the mind gets stronger

It ain't about a total score and
It ain't about us owning more things
If only we could go beyond our overall
I wonder when we might realise
Stop believing these real lies
At this rate that we kill and we fight
I'm wondering, ""will we survive?""
See? This is the scene of the crime
We need to be bleeding it dry
Where evil is winning and people
Are dying and pleading to keep me alive

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
[Bridge: 360]
Yo, I'm thinking it's time we left
'Cause not much time is left
And I don't want to die just yet
'Cause I know a lot of life is left
And I'm needing to find my breath
Right now, we're reaching the final steps
Soon enough, you're going to find me dead
With no one taking the time of death

[Hook: Bright Young Things]
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive
Love got us through the storm
Where we fell across for that high price built inside
Keep—keep me alive
Keep—keep me alive",rap

Look
Here’s your remedy
Enemies not akin to me
I’m who you pretend to be
Emcee
My energy unparalleled
Serenity will help me never fail
Engaging my dreams
Wedding bells tossed with holy grails
Rappers dissing for a buzz
What?
Like nurses in training, I got no patience for a scrub
A 50 in the club
When I pull up, I turn the world upside down
But stranger things can be found, through sound
Like back masking
I don’t rap, stop asking
I Paint The Sky,Blew
But I’m blackenеd from here on out
Been dope but thеy take it in vain
Morphine, more dreams got ‘em saying my name
I’m Destiny’s child, don’t you forget it
My train of thought—you can’t afford a ticket
No rest for the wicked when I kick it
God give me the approve
Life is a gamble and I got nothing to lose
Look, I’m from the city that lacks sleep, dark as the backstreets
Relax
These rap facts harder to catch like taxis as a black man
Want me to fail?
I’ll see if I can, sir
No CAT scan
Give ‘em two more
Okay, you lack fans ‘cause you not outstanding
Our grooves like the Gap Band
‘Blew blow my mind’ is what they say when I rhyme
But you need to resign
It’s my time
No more mister nice guy
Stealing my piece of the pie because the price high
Concise lies they supply on your screen
So we had to intervene
Not them
We the kings and queens, look
Are you watching now?
Are you watching?
Life on screen
A dream that y’all watching
Why you still fronting like you got a better option?
Navo, keep they heads bobbin’
I’m a shoo-in, they searchin’ for a loophole
You know what I compose
Fresher than new clothes
Rebuke foes
You ain’t on the same level as me
Sky Painter arranger they revel to see
Dropping gems like I didn’t want to dress out
Sketched out a plan that’ll show ‘em we the best out
Reside in the clouds but the South is where I’m from
With a hunger not to succumb to mere crumbs so
Gimme some
Matter fact, gimme more
Demi Moore, hit the Striptease/Ghost metaphors
They ain’t see it or catch it
It’s magic, sporadic
Back at it like bad habits
You let us in, we gon’ get the cabbage
You average
These veggies for the mind
Cruising in the 9-1-9
I align with the constellations
My rhymes defined as modern greatness
Divine innovation
But they still hating
Man, still hating?
It’s cool ‘cause I’m patient
Funimation
That means… you should be watching
You should be watching
You should be listening, gems that we dropping
Clocked in
Your top ten, I am not them
I’m me
On the stage we be rocking
Are you watching now?
Are you watching?
Life on screen
A dream, we all watchin'
Why you still frontin' like you got a better option?
Navo, keep they heads bobbin’ like this
Navo, keep they heads bobbin’
You should be watchin’
You should be watching and listening

Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me
I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
Before you and me run
To the place in our hearts
Where we hide

And I guess that's why
They call it the blues
Time on my hands
Could be time spent with you
Laughing like children
Living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why
They call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
Without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

So many spirits on me[x3]

So many spirits
Many voices telling me

There is no beginning, there is no end
Can nobody hear me?
God damn it, I swear to this day to refrain from complaints
Putting my blessings in brushes and swishers
Though I'm no baller, you know I got buckets
Many for one man to carry
The wave it is coming
Suspect shit from the outside
So my light shine bright from the inside
Break myself, never seen such insight
All my pain keeps me coexisting
I'm outside but my bones chilly, spark loose words with a vixen
The truth is revealed if you listen
This must be the west cause boy I been smithin'
Mystical rhymes up for desperate times
Reflecting and stretching the image
The shit they been telling me

Lurking with a couple dungeon masters
Man, I wouldn't put it past her
High like a pastor, passing the cannabis
To my fellow animals, hope you can handle it
This magic is powerful
What's your perspective of wealth?
I asked you boy speak for yourself
How far is too far out of reach?
My minds eye see so far away
Got me on my fuck a peace offering shit
Even when i'm gone I'll return as the spirit of the fog

Many voices telling me
Many spirits warned me of the second coming
We will return before the great lie
New tablets will arrive
Tapestries drape the walls
Bowls of nuggets, green and gold
Deeper beyond this life i reach
The rabbit whole leads through the vines
A path to the source of all things
It's horrible the things i see but i know that it's all divine in creation
I'm nothing but a tool for the mind
Watch me shape the physical
Even when i'm gone I'll return as the spirit of the fog
Return as the spirit of the fog boy

Things they wish they'd done
And all their bad sisters are walking high wires
Counting the days in a month

Nor does the half-baked lie
They get their hopes dirty once in a while
Wash them and hang them to dry
Everyone's down except for the clowns
And noah don't know where to go
It's hell up in heaven, there's nothing much here
And all the real men are below

What happens when dreams come true?
Will we know what to do
When our dreams come true?

So a saviour rolls in past the big sign
That says ""strangers - please turn round""
The men tie him up to a feeding post
And take his credentials down
The sun beats rays on our salad days
His lips get parched and dry
The girls bring him drink with a giggle and a wink
And his moment of glory expires
What happens when dreams come true?
Will we know what to do
When our dreams come true?

As the cowboy lies dying in the dust
She walks through the room where the gentlemen gather
Surrounded by debris and rust
She smoulders and steams, straight out of their dreams
But no-one will talk to her first

They're small and absurd
She leaves and we all die of thirst

Slowly on my shoulder, and he said to me

1358,"When I asked you to wait for me
You decided to leave
You left me all alone
And I will not bother to question
The decisions that you made for yourself
And it's like I've always known
I don't belong with anyone
(I don't belong with anyone)
I'm happy on my own
I don't belong with anyone
(I don't belong with anyone)
I'm happy on my own
Happy on my own

I came in here alone
So why would I be afraid
Especially now that the queen
Has finally laid
Her body nourishing the plains
All her efforts are not in vain
That's ensured because
Shе's in my DNA
I'm used to being alone
Thе calmness of the space I occupy
Is disturebed when I have to answer the phone
If you're casting the stone
Just do it in a way that don't affect
At all my balance
That promises I'll be known
So please don't call me
I don't want to talk!
I'll have with you this conversation
When I'm sitting at the top
Don't be masquerading
Looking in the mirror
All I see is a disappointment
That's hiding behind the chalk
I'm just trying to be better now
It's been myself
That's been holding me down
That's why I had to relinquish
The crown
The only thing that can
Save me right now is the sound
'cause I'm alone

When I asked you to wait for me
You decided to leave
You left me all alone
And I will not bother to question
The decisions that you made for yourself
And it's like I've always known
I don't belong with anyone
(I don't belong with anyone)
I'm happy on my own
I don't belong with anyone
(I don't belong with anyone)
I'm happy on my own
Happy on my own

It is this moment that I am seeking
Something to free my mind
From all the stresses that enslave it
As a result of the grind
And as my mood declines I am inclined
To try to be kind
And that still depends on the symbiosis
Between my heart and my mind
Yet to be redefined is every
Place in my life that people own
Or so they think
If you're on of them
Just know that I deemed it so
Worst of all is there are ticks
Trying to steal my flow
That's what they do
They lie, they come, they take, and then they go
I still don't complain
'cause I know there are people out there
Who're just trying to be me
Contrary to those who want to see me bleed
Suffer, or never be free
The closest one's are happy for you
Every time that you achieve
And not so much for when you fail
I know that people always leave
I'm just trying to do better man
It's been myself that's been holding me down
That's why I had to relinquish the crown
The only thing that can save me right now is the sound
'cause I'm alone

When I asked you to wait for me
You decided to leave
You left me all alone
And I will not bother to question
The decisions that you made for yourself
And it's like I've always known
I don't belong with anyone

Yo we had a few kings, some dudes wore the crown
Gotta say rest in peace to James Brown
I know you love the sound coming through your speakers
Feel it from your hat all the way to your sneakers
I wrote this thesis with pieces of the puzzle missin'
Make sure you choose wisley it's your decision
Gotta rendition & rederick you've never heard
Spit it with clarity my words are never slurred
I concured after seeing the facts baby
Very enthused after being relaxed baby, slipped through the cracks
And passed by undetected, you don't gotta like it
But you know you'll respect it, well connected & still make it
Pop, people wanna know ""Pete when your album drop?""
When hip hop's heart supposedly stopped
More bars than Alcatraz just call me the Rock

Yo you tryna mock me talk 'em out, I hate 'em
Standing here spitting all my bars verbatim
Ay yo spin it back son I'mma bring the fire

Pete Rock 07 still straighten it out
Y'all niggas hatin' on the South

I advise ya'll rap dudes better get on your grind
H-I-P H-O-P real life true story
Homey ain't D-E-A-D, I still get paid
If I don't make another beat, niggas say they made me
Then make another Pete, I got some other heat
That y'all never felt I like these cards & whoever dealt mine
Bets are straight even with the chips against me
Prove it to me 10 times & then you'll convince me
Seen some come & seen some go
Said I seen some who still don't know
I'm a true believer that hard work pays off
If you work hard one day you'll be the boss

C'mon the games been good I had a long run
You might miss hearing from me like when the songs done
The wrong one, get it in his clutches
It's like giving a dude who can't roll all the Dutches (can't roll)
I got a budget but don't ask about me
Look ma dude hold your dick when you pee! Exactly
Be concerned with yourself
Said you waste a lotta energy destroying your health
My time is spent dealing with truth
I've been a world renowned name before they said it in Juice (before they said it)
Put you in position, staring down the barrel
We got prisoners of rap shout out to Jamal Barrels
Show me the work & put it on the scal
I always hate to see a black man in jail
If I could tip the scales & talk to Lady Justice
The cops will be on trial the government be busted
I can't trust it, it ain't always been true
Leave the game with a question mark like DJ Clue
Gotta give thanks, be grateful for my gifts

Cause everything I do is mistake, mistake, mistake
It’s humbling
And that which makes me awkward
It’s easy to wish away

How’s anybody supposed to love me?
And they say the stress is just the clouds
And I’m the sky
The storm will pass sometime
And I’ll be fine

For the past couple of years now

It’s falling on me
Pushing me further down
I’m a wilted flower barely holding it together

Cause I think someone might want to hear me
What keeps me going are my lyrics
To think I could help someone like me
What keeps me going are the ones that I love
What keeps me going is knowing
There’s something more
Than just this feeling that I’m holding inside
And they say it’s just the weather
I’ve got to let it ride

Hark! hark!
The dogs do bark;
         Beggars are coming to town.
Some in rags,
And some in tags,
         And some in velvet gown.


The summer brooded and the winds were husht,
And on the palace walls the sunshine slept,
And all within King Arthur's court withdrew
To where the shadows deepest lay, and thought
Of winter and the snow. But he, the King,
Sitting beside a window that o'erhung
The stream that murmur'd past the lichen'd walls
And wander'd thro' the meadows to the sea,
Mus'd on the time when of the Table Round
The number was complete and of his knights
Not one was absent from his place. But now
The seat of many a one in Arthur's hall
Was vacant, and from off the walls was gone
Full many a blazon'd, burnisht, knightly shield.
This had not been, so sadly Arthur mus'd,
But for the apparition of the Grail
Seen in a vision by that holy maid,
The sister of Sir Percivale, who told
The wondrous tale to all his brother knights,
And straightway set them longing for the Quest.
Then, while he mus'd, the voice of Dagonet,
The fool, shrill'd thro' the silence, and the King
Lookt up. Before him stood the fool, who call'd,
""Arouse, my brother fool, and hark to me!""
Then answer'd Arthur, nothing loth to break
A jest or two with little Dagonet,
""But why thy brother fool am I?""
     To whom
The jester, shaking all his bells, replied,
""What sayest thou of him who constant wears
A thistle next his heart and knows not whence
His pain? Who fain would make a shining crown
From lumps of lead? And such a fool art thou.
And therefore shouldst thou wear a cap and bells,
And therefore have I call'd thee brother fool.""
Then thus the King:
     ""A bitter, pointless jest;
Thy wit doth not increase as doth thy age.""
To whom, in answer, shrill'd Sir Dagonet:
""Said I not truly? Take my cap and bells;""
Then mutter'd, past the hearing of his lord,
""The thistle next his heart is Guinevere,
His Queen,"" and after, spoke aloud, ""Thy knights,
My brother fool, are not they all dull lumps
Of lead? And after all thy pains are spent
Upon them leaden still they yet remain.
Of such as these thou vainly hop'st to make
A shining crown of manhood in thy realm,
And therefore have I call'd thee 'brother fool.' ""
""Thy wit is sharply edged, my fool,"" here spoke
The King, ""and yet, for all its sharpness, fails.""
Thereat the dwarf peer'd curiously up
Into his master's face, and seeing naught
Unusual in its kingly grace, had turn'd,
But turning, caught the echo of a sigh,
And knew his arrow reach'd King Arthur's heart.
Thereafter fell a silence on the twain
And Arthur mus'd as sadly as before
On hopes that had been his in long-past days
When he had plann'd the healing of the world.
Slow past a morning hour until at last
A momentary vagrant breeze, that thro'
The high, unlatticed, open window swept,
Tost aimlessly an early wither'd leaf
Into the kingly lap. Then spoke the King,
Smoothing the fade leaf:

     ""Sir Dagonet,
It may be that thy song is gentler than
Thy wit; if so be, let me hear.""
     Whereat
The dwarf, moving to where a gilded harp
Half hidden in a corner of the room
Gleam'd like a star in mellow darkness set,
Sudden swept all its strings impatiently,
And when the gust of music sank and died
And rose again to live in wailing, sang,--
And sad and bitter were the tune and words.
""High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may;
The buds have blown, their perfume is no more;
The time is sped, the glory past away;
New time, new strife,--the hours of joy are o'er;
New strife, new hate, to fit this later day;
New hates are deep as those that were before;
High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may.""

The singer ended, and his bitter notes
Were follow'd by the snapping of a string.
Then said the King:

     ""Ye do the harp a wrong,
To make it sponsor for your grewsome stave,
And kinder had it been to chant a strain
More pleasing unto weary ears like mine.""
To whom then sadly spake Sir Dagonet:

""No lightsome lays are left to sing; the hours
Of joy are o'er;"" and while the King his words
Revolv'd in mind and echo found therein,
The dwarf obeisance made and danced away.

""High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may.""
The King said slowly to himself, and paus'd,
For sudden rose a clamor in the streets,
As if the countless dogs of Camelot
Were all one voice, such uproar was there made.
Then Arthur, wond'ring at the din, arose
And past to an apartment that o'erlookt
The city's streets, and peering forth, he saw
A train of weary pilgrims near the city walls.
Then open swung the weirdly sculptur'd gates,
And Arthur knew the men, his knights return'd
From Quest of Holy Grail. And first rode Bors
And Lancelot. Dim were the trappings once
So gay on men and steeds, and tatter'd shreds
Now wav'd and flutter'd from their garments' hems.
Behind rode Percivale, in dusty rags,
And after, others worn and torn as he,
And beggars never seem'd so poor as these,
The crest and flower of Arthur's Table Round;
But last of all Gawain in velvet fine
Flasht gayly by with knightly comrades twain,
For pleasant was the Quest for him who made
So sure the holy Quest was not for him,
And thus King Arthur saw his knights return
From Quest a twelvemonth long of Holy Grail.
Loud rose the canine clamor in the streets
As these rode by, a beggar throng to eyes
Which saw them pass beyond the city walls
The year before, impelled by holy zeal,
And he who now shone brightest, false Gawain,
In honor's ranks the faintest of them all,
But shriller rang the voice of Dagonet
Dancing beside the train, who, as he saw
The kingly face regarding all who past,
With slender finger pointed to the knights
Return'd as beggars from their bootless Quest,
And sang, and bitter both the notes and words,--

""High hopes--high deeds--we hope but while we may.""",misc

Get your favorite one to sit by your side

And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met

And then we recall that fall and that moment

You probably know this already, that I’m not rich

Ha. When I finish, you be off the walls, like we something but we nothing at all (yeah)
You want another, gotta keep on the low, don’t be up on my shit
If my girl find out, I be pleading the fifth…
Rolling through at certain times, like I’m doing shift
Don’t get mad, throwing trash, if I call it a miss

If we end up doing something, I ain’t thirsty

Just a crusher, playing games in the worse way

Ain’t a second gone by, where she wanna stop
She ain’t even getting tired, while she on top (ugh)
Ass much fatter than...
I can’t say, cause the bitch get mad
But the pussy much better than the last I had
And I only got the pussy with a freestyle rap
Wanting meal time, heads, hit the G spot
And she wearing all red, from the feet up
I’m like, come on over here, MamaSita
Get her fully undressed, better view when I see her
From the beginning, I never thought I’d be winning
Or getting anything I want from the girl who was chilling
And never showing any signs or be giving attention
Never knew she want it bad, like she wanting a lesson

I liked to died wit the steel in my face
And the reason was I outta pocket, trippin' searchin' for ______!
Each step was taken deeper into enemy lands
So while I’m walkin', I avoid the glares of the damaged
Ignore the cries from the infants, screamin' due to hunger
Brushin' past some niggas that's obstructin' my path
But I’m in colors they don’t like and that incurred they wrath
Look, I wanna make it home and baby girl not worth the trouble
If these niggas wanna fade then I gotta squabble
Gotta stand my ground I ain’t no motherfuckin' bitch and shit
This kinda logic a problem
Better not cross that street, must keep my cool
Mutter under my breath so Allah keep me grounded
They was confused by my demeanor
She waitin' I kept it pushin'
Eyes follow my moves, I can feel that they lookin
Advancin' on my position, my paranoia increasin'
Heart rate was thumpin', I’m thinkin they creepin'
An OG sat on the porch, he starin' in my direction
Seen his students gawkin and felt I need a lesson but then he noticed my fear
Sweat drippin' wit tears so then he raised his hand
And them niggas in they tracks
He stood there on his porch, I ain’t turn to look back

So Emmet Till was the lesson
Told myself I’ll kill his killers wit my blade then dip
As I seen a cruiser cruisin' up the block hella close
Becomin' real anxious, thinkin' it’s them from the block
But the whip slide through darkness and I see it’s a pig
Look, I ain’t did a motherfuckin' thing, I’ll keep pushin
He greet me wit a grin as the whip inchin' closer
Urgin' me to stop but I’m clean as a whistle
So he throw that bitch in park and hop out wit aggression
Wit his hand on his weapon askin' fucked up questions
Like, ""where you from boy? I know you prolly bang""
I remain quiet, never addressed by my name or my locale
I’m fightin' back tears kuz he could kill me and be hailed a Samaritan
Paid for my murder wit medals and public fame
His hand grip tightly around his strap, he know I'm not no threat
It’s power trip, they love seein' your fear so you adhere to their commands
I overstand that’s why I fuckin' ran
Back to the 40s where Imma take that chance
Officer stopped pursuit kuz he knew was wrong
OG still observing while he bumpin' his song

While royal Moses as High Priest should stand,
The tables twain to take, and sacrifice.
Then came the Law amid a nation's cries
Of fear and mad revolt from God's command

Made all the Earth, at last, a Holy Land;

Main
To gain the good will of his Captain's good name
He came ashore, one evening from the sea
And that was beginning of me own true love and me

Chorus:
And it's home boys, home
Home I'd like to be, home for awhile
In me own country, where the oak and the ash and the
Bonny rowan tree
Are all a growin' greener, in the North Country

I asked her for a candle for to light me way to bed
Likewise for a handkerchief to tie around me head
She tended to me needs, like a young maid ought to do
Then I says to her, why don't you jump in with me too

Chorus

She jump into bed and makin' no alarm
Thinking a young sailor lad could do to her no harm
I hugged her; I kissed her, the whole night long
Till she wished the short night had been seven years
Long
Chorus

Early next morning the sailor lad arose
And into Mary's apron, threw a handful of gold
Sayin' ""Take this, my dear. For the damage that I've
Done
For tonight I fear I've left you with a daughter or a
Son.""

Chorus

And if it be a girl child, send her out to nurse
With gold in her pocket and with silver in her purse
And if it be a boy child, he'll wear the jacket blue
And go climbing up the riggin', like his daddy used to
Do

So come all of you fair maidens, a warning take be me
Never let a sailor lad an inch above your knee
I trusted one and he beguiled me
He left me with a pair of twins to dandle on me knee

“So what are these barriers that keep people from reaching anywhere near their real potential?
The answer to that can be found in another question, and that’s this: Which is the most universal human characteristic; fear, or laziness?”
Good question… for me it’s a bit of both
Doubting my ability, sometimes being too lazy to execute
But in the process of finding one self, one has to stay true to self


[Verse 1 – Ed Rowe]
Found myself lost in time as I toss a rhyme
Even with sleep I keep the force aligned
To have my scripts depict shit that ain’t falsified
Won’t endorse a lie I’m staying true to self at all times
With Altzheim’s wouldn’t forget the times I had to crawl, climb
To make it happen, not to say I made it rappin
To savor my sacred passion, amazed how the days are lappin
Time flies when I’m immersed in this
Merciless towards the pen and pad
Bleeding sharpies dry until the pages clad
Of lyrical fluid, either to boo it or construe it
For the gem it is, see that’s the snapshot, crop the negatives
Helps my head exist amidst the imbalance of serotonin
What I’m flowing is like a dosage of pheromones
In a brain-size capsule, raps will snap an axle
To re-adjust my drive the way a GPS would ask you
Whether or not I want it, would take the knot in my stomach
And use it as motivation, elevate, the weight will plummet

[Chorus x2]
Leave my stamp on this world
These songs will vouch for me if Heaven demands a referral
And if my work ain’t up to par then I’m probably barred
Cause it’s hell denying self when the crown should be ours


[Verse 2 – Sleep Sinatra]
Enter my tortuous perfection, obsessing over quotables
Portraits of self etched in, so many with a similar dream and disconnection
With reality it seems I gotta keep a deeper message
Rooted in juvenile correction, I understood self at a young age
Through inner soul reflection
Bringing poems from the core it’s more than inception
A spiritual connection to the pen and pad’s blessing
From the time of hieroglyphs to modern penmen
Expressing all the pain through these rhymes, the art of venting
I start a session and go deeper than the planet’s core
The dedication resonates in those who want it more
So I engage in mental war until my armor’s cracked
Then I revert back to blacksmith and harden that
See evolution and growth in life is part of fact
That’s why I hope these tablets later become artifacts

[Chorus x2]
Leave my stamp on this world
These songs will vouch for me if Heaven demands a referral
And if my work ain’t up to par then I’m probably barred
Cause it’s hell denying self when the crown should be ours


[Verse 3 – Ed Rowe]
Trapped in a funnel befuddled, rappin a muddled rebuttal
And scratching at stubble, glancing at gems through the lens of a Hubble
Stumbling over microscopics, devising topics and psychic optics
Foresight, despite the blockage
Writer stoppage, pickin lines kept from kickin rhymes
Thick at times, striking like I ain’t stealing the penchant signs
Gifts divine though I was doubting that
Striking up a heated convo with the Creator, having a shouting match
Questioning my purpose, putting pens to service
Against serpents that got me tight roping like rocking small chains in a circus
Some say I need to preach that’s why I speak through verses
Focused on the straight and narrow, peeping in discrete diversions
In the process, long as Yah bless me with the wisdom
And knowledge to deposit I’ll invest it when the kids come
And sip some of summer’s sweet nectar while I perfect the style
Music meant to bless your child

[Chorus x2]
Leave my stamp on this world
These songs will vouch for me if Heaven demands a referral
And if my work ain’t up to par then I’m probably barred
Cause it’s hell denying self when the crown should be ours


[Outro – Ed Rowe]
Individuation… is coming to know, is giving expression to, is harmonizing the various components of your soul
It’s realizing your uniqueness, and tapping into your true self. It’s a process like no other
It’s word to mother. Yeah… Ongoing… but imma keep it strong flowin… elevating to the stars above… much love… one",rap
2154,"There's a [buzzing] strip light on the lowered tile ceiling
Interrupting a snacking routine
As crumbs fall like snow to the spine of H**t magazine

The music was bored, stripped of her youth
In favour of repeat and roll
As time pays the bills and buys comforts for kitchen and soul

Gotta seize the day
Oh God, let us pray
That the sunshine won't go away
And she left today
Lit the fuse and staggered away
[Swept] The last evidence to the hole inside the day

Through faded mugs on postcards
[We] Wage futile war against the grey
As we peer through menthol scent fingers to 9:38

Ten hours later, music drives a car down to the lake
Now she's taken enough
And now someone will pay
Gotta seize the day
Oh God, let us pray
That the sunshine won't go away
And she left today
Lit the fuse and staggered away

Someone leans over
To throw dirt in my open grave
A half million dead drunks
Can’t seem to teach us a single thing

I'm pretty sure it gets worse
But I know that I've been wrong before

And we fall like ribbons

1509,"    Perhaps the best way to introduce this novel which on my third reading of it astounds me even more than the first is to tell of my first encounter with it. While I was teaching at Loyola in 1976 I began to get telephone calls from a lady unknown to me. What she proposed was preposterous. It was not that she had written a couple of chapters of a novel and wanted to get into my class. It was that her son, who was dead, had written an entire novel during the early sixties, a big novel, and she wanted me to read it. Why would I want to do that? I asked her. Because it is a great novel, she said.

    Over the years I have become very good at getting out of things I don’t want to do. And if ever there was something I didn’t want to do, this was surely it: to deal with the mother of a dead novelist and, worst of all, to have to read a manuscript that she said was great, and that, as it turned out, was a badly smeared, scarcely readable carbon.

    But the lady was persistent, and it somehow came to pass that she stood in my office handing me the hefty manuscript. There was no getting out of it; only one hope remained that I could read a few pages and that they would be bad enough for me, in good conscience, to read no farther. Usually I can do just that. Indeed the first paragraph often suffices. My only fear was that this one might not be bad enough, or might be just good enough, so that I would have to keep reading.

    In this case I read on. And on. First with the sinking feeling that it was not bad enough to quit, then with a prickle of interest, then a growing excitement, and finally an incredulity, surely it was not possible that it was so good. I shall resist the temptation to say what first made me gape, grin, laugh out loud, shake my head in wonderment. Better let the reader make the discovery on his own.

    Here at any rate is Ignatius Reilly, without progenitor in any literature I know of slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one who is in violent revolt against the entire modern age, lying in hisflannel night shirt, in a back bedroom on Constantinople Street in New Orleans, who between gigantic seizures of flatulence and eructations is filling dozens of Big Chief tablets with invective.

    His mother thinks he needs to go to work. He does, in a succession of jobs. Each job rapidly escalates into a lunatic adventure, a full-blown disaster; yet each has, like Don Quixote’s, its own eerie logic.

    His girlfriend, Myrna Minkoff of the Bronx, thinks he needs sex. What happens between Myrna and Ignatius is like no other boy meets girl story in my experience.

    By no means a lesser virtue of Toole’s novel is his rendering of the particularities of New Orleans, its back streets, its out-of-the-way neighborhoods, its odd speech, its ethnic whites and one black in whom Toole has achieved the near-impossible, a superb comic character of immense wit and resourcefulness without the least trace of Rastus minstrelsy.

    But Toole’s greatest achievement is Ignatius Reilly himself, intellectual, ideologue, deadbeat, goof off, glutton, who should repel the reader with his gargantuan bloats, his thunderous contempt and one-man war against everybody Freud, homosexuals, heterosexuals, Protestants, and the assorted excesses of modern times. Imagine an Aquinas gone to pot, transported to New Orleans whence he makes a wild foray through the swamps to LSU at Baton Rouge, where his lumber jacket is stolen in the faculty men’s room where he is seated, overcome by mammoth gastro intestinal problems. His pyloric valve periodically closes in response to the lack of a “proper geometry and theology” in the modern world.

    I hesitate to use the word comedy though comedy it is because that implies simply a funny book, and this novel is a great deal more than that. A great rumbling farce of Falstaffian dimensions would better describe it; commedia would be closer to it.

    It is also sad. One never quite knows where the sadness comes from from the tragedy at the heart of Ignatius’s great gaseous rages and lunatic adventures or the tragedy attending the book itself.
    The tragedy of the book is the tragedy of the author -- his suicide in 1969 at the age of thirty-two. Another tragedy is the body of work we have been denied.

   It is a great pity that John Kennedy Toole is not alive and well and writing. But he is not, and there is nothing we can do about it but make sure that this gargantuan tumultuous human tragicomedy is at least made available to a world of readers.

      WALKER PERCY

    There is a New Orleans city accent, associated with downtown New Orleans, particularly with the German and Irish Third Ward, that is hard to distinguish from the accent of Hoboken, Jersey City, and Astoria, Long Island, where the Al Smith inflection, extinct in Manhattan, has taken refuge. The reason, as you might expect, is that the same stocks that brought the accent to Manhattan imposed it on New Orleans.

    “You’re right on that. We’re Mediterranean. I’ve never been to Greece or Italy, but I’m sure I’d be at home there as soon as I landed.”

    He would, too, I thought. New Orleans resembles Genoa or Marseilles, or Beirut or the Egyptian Alexandria more than it does New York, although all seaports resemble one another more than they can resemble any place in the interior. Like Havana and Port-au-Prince, New Orleans is within the orbit of a Hellenistic world that never touched the North Atlantic. The Mediterranean, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico form a homogeneous, though interrupted, sea.

And girl I know you need me
It's late night and we sleepy
Starin’ at you I'm just dreamin'
On the rooftop, there’s a party
Lets finish what we started
Standin' next to you, I feel rewarded
Lets finish what we started
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..

You got the cup, and yeah I got the liquor
It's pretty obvious you know that I missed ya
Talking about you all the time to your sister
I guess she told you I want to be in the picture
But yeah its kinda true
And I've been wondering if you will like me to
She said ""Why you trippin' Sheen of course I do""
Man she's so perfect had to show her to the crew

Let me be your gentleman
You my one and only medicine
When I met you up in Edmonton
I was thinkin' everybody else irrelevant
Me and you, do it for the hell of it
And we never feelin' celibate
Just celebratin’ ’til the end of it
You the first lady and I'm the president

It ain’t a game but I'm in first place

Just all my boys and me
We've been sipping on some tea
And my friend's ex girl might throw a party down the street
Bring the band or bring some drinks
Might just get us in for free yea

Green grass on the road and a sidewalk pavement
Far from the city but not far from the action
Swerving on a roundabout hanging on a back end

I'm not faded but my camera still out of frame
In a lawn chair sipping on some lemonade
If your mind acting up you might need some shade
Throwing daygers through the day then we start a rave

(That's so hard)
Spent my summer in the suburbs with the cul-de-sac heat
Just all my boys and me
We've been sipping on some tea
And my friend's ex girl might throw a party down the street
Bring the band or bring some drinks
Might just get us in for free yea
Throwin the back of the road
Shawty move down like it’s slo-mo
I got a flex for tomorrow
Got my feet down like on ten toes

I dare you to stare at the sun
I’m blowin trees just for fun
Ride to panna blow my funds
Munchies bro I’m tryna grub

Let’s ride to brickell tomorrow
I got big bills for some tacos
Post the addy and these hoes gone follow
Hope that girls a slut she better swallow

I’ll hit my boy for some bottles
Hit the clutch I go full throttle
Riced up my whip and I drip like the weather
Belt cause a grip and I feel like mayweather

I’m goin 90 I’ll still hit a turn
I’m driving fast and I’m letting it burn
Shawties lined up and they wait for their turn
I’m living life for the minute

If you feel like you got it got lessons to learn
Shawty she with me she like how I swerve
I floor the gas give a fuck if I’m turnt
God shined the light and I’m in it
I'm breakin it down
I’m tearin it down
She holding me down
I got bills on me now
Aura up to my crown
Blowin smoke all around
I can not hear you know
This tree is too loud
Bro are you playin around
This bud it tastes like ground

Spent my summer in the suburbs with the cul-de-sac heat
Just all my boys and me
We've been sipping on some tea

Bring the band or bring some drinks
Might just get us in for free yea

You bring the band
I bring the bands
Shawty lil hands
Move in a trance
Fuck all the Xans
Smoke in my hands
Smell like a can
Of weed
Girl get away from me
You live in a different estate from me
Why I see you everyday a creep
What she is and she can’t even keep it G
In the suburbs the birds always tweakin
Imma nighttime boy Michael Keaton
I hustle all day while you tweetin
Like Kenen come alive in the weekend
Do it like mike and just beat it
I toke all the dope in the evening
Like a boat imma float from my demons
Grindin hard till I fill the arenas

Check  jeans yea I got the keys
Have ya bitch in the bed begging please
Slide in the poon so smooth like grease
Imma Glory boy bitch but I’m not lil Reese
A beast from the east I don’t stop till I eat
All you peons like it’s all raw meat
Wish you could see all this guap on me
Style biters soon finna feed off me

Cowboy like deon
I be on the porch
Smoke gas no neon
I lean on the door
She mean fa
No reason
She finna start a war
So I be on
The begones

Not in level but in love
While I’ve always been the logical one, it took caress to realize
I wasn’t wrong just cuz I made her angry
Giving me a chance to speak and listening is believing

There’s no point making me feel bad
Just gotta be honest with ourselves
There’s no point making me feel bad
For being me

I owe you some dignity, I can have love and not show it automatically
You need more attеntion; you need less a-talkin’-to
It’s me going through the motions whеn I encounter pain
Cuz the unordinary is more memorable
I’m not saying you gotta mother me, but there are other ways to deal with it

If there’s a mood that you’ve been on, I’ll stay home. I have no pride
I don’t know if it was a mistake so why should I try to lie
I invented the reason for making that choice; I didn’t have one
But if I wouldn’t have been this bored I’d have ignored the alarming signs",rock

Our revenge is yet to come
Powers of the system have been overtaken
Politician elimination has already begun
They must be punished for telling us a lie
As we slowly grow communist
Our limited freedom begins to die

Now's the time for the supreme beings
To step down from their thrones
To feel pantalgia no one's ever known
No form of retaliation will make up for damage done

Innocene wiped out by subliminal command
We shall feel no sorrow as they cry for their life
We'll stick to our word and never give in
Each will slave to us this force will win
As all happenings take place they're not by our will
Our subconscious minds have been disturbed
Therefore we've developed this instinct to kill
As we all perished eternally we've only them to blame
Gluttony and greed totally ruled their mind
Now we all suffer and the past is a thought left behind",rock

Fall down on your knees
If you try to please those forgotten kids of tragedy

And they'd all been told
That their hearts were cold to the twentieth century

And when your heart denied
Did you ever try to show them sympathy?
Stand back on your heels
And see how you feel in the face of charity

So if you don't see the signs in me
Look out for the kids of tragedy
You can trace that line in reality
To the kids, whoa, oh, oh of tragedy

Look back on your lives
Your memories are hiding the kids of tragedy
Fall down on your knees

You let them take the blame
But did you feel the shame for the things you let them do?
And when you made them a part
Of your reckless game, your talking won't do

So stand and admit you were wrong to forget
There were times they needed you
Those times when they lied
The envy of pride as it tried to face the truth

Sittin’ on the edge of the street, waiting for a hurricane
All I get is a little bit of rain

I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of drinking and making friends
A girl offered me an inexpensive kiss, I took it
But there’s gotta be something better than that

Outside, in a line, all the faces started to look the same
Have I seen you somewhere, before, with a different name?
And I wrote this song in a restaurant
For a girl who could have whatever she wants
But she seems to have forgotten what she wanted

Everything you give, you get it back somehow
But I’ve given too much to too many people now
All these memories have emptied me, I feel haunted
But I’m no ghost

Back at the club, they finally let me in
But I guess my heart just wasn’t in it
I don’t know what I expected to find
Guess I was just passing time
And it’s easy to lose yourself in a darkened room
Feeling someone’s body rise and fall
Feels like the older I get, the less I understand
Soon, I won’t know anything at all

If there was a doorway, there was a sign
There was a signal for the blind, an easy way out, then I’d use it
And maybe there’s a god above, and maybe there’s a perfect love
But the rest of us, all we have is music

You ain't picking up your phone
I'm calling you all night all
Wishing you were next me
Making perfect harmonies
Thinking that everything's okay but I get feelings fading
Here we go our separate ways now
Feeling all these kinda ways, I
Know that I can't keep waiting
You're persuading my body to let you in
I can't pretend I don't want your loving
Deep down in my heart I know it's real

[Chorus]
Sometimes I slip back and think bout' my life
Why am I still trapped, why am I still blind?
I want to take time to relax my mind
But I can't cause' I know that you're using me so frequently baby
So frequently baby
So frequently baby
So frequеntly baby
[Verse 2]
I'm in need of clarity and understanding
Can't you see I'm really down and really hurting
Can you feel thе pain in my soul?
Think it's time to let go
You got the fire in my room
I'm here alone
I'm tucked away
You reap what you sow
You say you're alone yeah
I see the passion inside
Open your eyes
Can't you feel it?
Our hearts align
Deep breath away

Sometimes I slip back and think bout' my life
Why am I still trapped, why am I still blind?

Not gonna be afraid no more

Verse 1
Waking up every day
Thinking what im gonna pay
With the money i made
Thinking what im gonna say
When the wife ask me
Where the money we saved
Use the loot for the gas bill
To pay the rent
More loot from the light bill i spent
Dont wanna get the phone
Cause it just keeps ringin
Alot of things through the mail
Got me thinkin i can make it
If i use more debt
Get a refi on the crib
But the loan man keep sayin not yet
I rob pete make a deal with paul
Prayin that pink slip dont fall
Brother ain't got time
Too much on the grind
Im gone let it go
Trust God let Him know

Chorus

Seems like every day
Somethin worse poppin up
On the news report
Should i keep the kids home from school
Should i stay away from the airport

Using fear as a weapon revoke hate
Everybody think the world ain't a safe place
Dont wanna use the phone cause it might be
Shhh somebodies listening

Alot of views got me all confused
And i really dont know what to think
(we got)
Executives, liberals, activist, sprital, hipocrits
On the brink
One nations deadly call
Results in another nations fall
People ain't got time
Too much on the grind
We gone let it go
Trust God let Him know
Chorus

Gas up through the roof
And i just bought a hummer and convertibl coupe
Tryna keep a little juice in the boose
In my trunk
But the loots in use
PAJAMs working over time
Keeping hope alive
Keeping Moss in the ministry and public eye
But hypothetically what happens if the phone stops ringin
Its my belief (not gonna be afraid no more)
Of poverty (not gonna be afraid no more)
Not losing sleep (not gonna be afraid no more)
Of running out of money (not gonna be afraid no more)
Racist (not gonna be afraid no more)
Terrorists (not gonna be afraid no more)
Brother ain't got time
Too much on the grind
Imma let it go
Trust God let Him know

It’s  like their terrified
Cause they never understand
The thoughts that running through my mind
Like a flash bang went off
And  blinded all your eyes
So I’m here to drop some knowledge
And open up your blinds
It’s hard to see the fake
When they’ve blended with your friends

Over shit that ain’t worth $10
Funny how these boys chicken
Acting like they in a coup
But then quick to ask you
When you boutta shoot them a coup

I know the ones that really repped me from the beginning
And understood who repped me only when I started winnin

Loving like no other walking down the cold  fucking aisle
But One day the feelings all start tuh pile
Til they break the surface like every piece of tile
Will you smile?

So slow it down
And cruise through the town
No need to rush your life
Relax and hear the sounds
We all some young kings and queens
Just trynna find our crown

Those the brothers Id feed

Make you understand
That the world ain’t so mean
Your city’s watcha make it
So make it a dream
For the young ones
Making it by any means
Trynna chase a dream
I understand the hustle
Tried to get it from the ground up
Made my own blood bubble
Sophisticated future sight
Outta sight space time like the space Hubble
Trynna get this money
Stack it all up money moving on the double
Everybody telling me that I was causing trouble
But troublesome see what troublesome do
Right turns outta left
And that’s where we’ve come to
So who?
Gonna judge me before they judge theyself?
Crucifying every person trynna reach some wealth
The worlds teaching everybody that this is the way it goes
Never helping one another reach the sky and grab our goals
So you know
I ain’t here to stan with it
I Can’t understand it
I can’t stand it

Man i drove down to Ghent in my underwear
I went lookin for some new funny clothes to wear
I was feelin strange
I'd say a little deranged

So i walk on in this funky place
Just to see what kinda groove that i could trace
I saw her face
And her elegant taste

Dancin to a disco was the bananaqueen
Thourougly surrounded by her royal bananakin
I was amazed
She put a smile on my face

She said:
Hey man
You shouldn't be worried 'bout the good or the bad
Or all them stories
Just a slowly point your life
In the right direction
And live it up to the max of true satisfaction
Hey
My life is okay

But it didn't really matter to the people that were turning
To the left
To the right

Everything

Oooooooooooh man just give me everything EVERYTHING

She had the muscles of a giant with a delicate skill
She had the softness of a mama and the kindness of a granny
She was yelling like James Brown Joyce Donkey Daddy

I like my cornbread when it's nice and fresh
I like my cornbread with a little bit of butter
Like them sticky fingers when it gets so wet

Hey mama don't you make a poor man beg
Hey mama don't you hear what I say
I need your cornbread every day, mmm every day

I like to eat my cornbread in the kitchen
I like to eat it on the back porch swing
I like my cornbread in the middle of the winter
I like a little extra cornbread in the spring

In the mornings when I've got a hundred miles to go
I eat my baby's cornbread real slow
And when it's cold and I’m out on the road
My baby's cornbread make me want to come home

I keep my baby's recipe a secret
Ain't had no cornbread like this before
Well sometimes that cornbread gets sticky
But sticky's good in my book I think I'll have some more
Hey mama don't you make a poor man beg, mama don't you make a man beg
Hey mama don't you hear what I say
I need your cornbread every day, mmm every day

Mmm-mmm-mmm, that's right

I like to watch my baby making cornbread
I like to watch her fingers in the dough
Sometimes that cornbread cooks quickly
Sometimes it cooks awful slow

Hey mama don't you hear what I say

Getting warm outside
We were flowers blooming

Wound insight positive it
Was love at first bite
Heaven seems relative on
Our first night I could
Swear it was for ever
Until our first fight
Do it all I still took your calls
But they were never came
Staring at the ceiling when
It pours it rains
Can we go back there
Can we go back there
Is it too late is it all fair

When it’s bad it’s hate
When the love was enough

I've been the man since the sandbox, watching Sandlot making my own rules
The Game Is Mine! shit, I'm old school
You cannot compare me to these new niggas
I am not, nothing like these new niggas
I fear that you get me misconstrued, so I rap to the old school beats
Bringing new school heat with my brother Geeta G
Different mothers but we both sons to the game
Yeah, our father's the same, never fucking with you lames
I could never understand how you sell out for a little piece of fame
Diamond rings, and a couple gold chains
The ignorance is strange! shit, but how can I complain when I know my
Little brother feels a pain that I can't even explain
Laying in that hospital bed and getting rolled around in that wheelchair
Shit ain't fair! If anyone should've been there, I know it should've been me
I know he wouldn't agree, but that's just how I feel
And shit's been real ever since
The time spent, separated myself constant from nonsense the concentration mind flips
Ignorance to educated, deep thoughts of sober thinking, but I do get faded, nevertheless
Disrespectful shit, I will not take it
Second guess, and you will not make it and that's an understatement
You can underline or over-think it
Little nigga with a mastermind keeping one eye open, call me Plankton
The Game Is Ours! I'm here for the taking
We only came for the Benjamin Franklins, shit sweet, cinnamon flavored
King seat, head of the table, meetings at the end of the day
Making sure the ends meet at the end of the day
I gain it all just to give it away
To save face we say grace before we feast on the prey
That's the beauty and the beast turned predator
Compared to his competitors, there is no comparison
Done with you lames and you characters, Acting out of character
Fuck around and get wrote out the script

Sit at the table, saying ""thank you"" to the most high
For keeping you safe from most guys thinking you Chocha
Eager to get you wet like coasters
And I broke ties with niggas with closed eyes cause they'll pull under
Imagine letting Stevie Wonder drive! It's suicide and where I'm from its ""Do or Die""
I'm just a raisin in the sun spitting Cajun from the tongue
Any day I'm not working is time wasted
I'm just a young nigga tryna' make it, grinding from the basement
Until I'm acquainted with sky-scraping suites and bank account statements
Living dangerous! Chains and whips could never compensate for the slave ships
So we mastermind until they feel your anguish (until they feel your anguish)

Hit up a gangsters paradise, with a blue snapback

What has two eyes and four limbs
With disguises to hide all ulterior intent?
Well, it's a liar
A description which you fit the best
Impressed?
I can smell espionage on your breath
Flesh is flesh and blood is blood
Sex is sex and love is love
Successful sex makes lovers numb
Yes, the sex makes lovers cum together
But never let your business be preceded by your pleasure
Slip and get addicted to ecstasy
You'll get lost forever
You clever
You know it
Power and how to use it
I knew it too
How do you think that I deduced it?
Follow clues
Break it down to molecules
Feel it in your follicles
All these mental obstacles
Double lives
Double lies
It can give you double vision
Which hinders your precision
When aiming your cruel intentions?
And if you really wanna know the truth
I know all the signs because I exhibit them too

In the mid of the eve
I hear your footsteps by my door
I can tell the way you hesitate

They say that honesty's the best policy
But sometimes
I gotta fight with the devil
Clouding my mind
She chargin in like a rebel
For that quality time
She know that something's going on
I think she's reading my mind
Blinded by the way I feel
Torn between the two
And all of us have something real
What the fuck to do
I'm juggling this circus
Always acting
No rehearsing
I'm so thirsty
For that passion
They hungry for that ration
And I can never give
Because I'm living a lie
Or I'm living the truth
With a chick on the side
What if it happened to you
She got a dick on the side
I'll be crushed like a mu'fucka
Ready to ride
Look out!
I read the rules
But I threw the book out
But this chapter's for you
Baby, better look out
That's what they said
See you can have the best thing since sedatives
Part time drama where they leave you for dead with this
[Outro: Deepak Chopra]
People today are consumed by doubts about their relationships
Have I found the right partner?
Am I being true to myself?
As a result, there is a restless kind of consumer shopping for partners
The path to love, however, is never about externals
The person you are with at this moment is the right person because he or she is a mirror of who you are inside
Every fault you see in them touches a denied weakness in yourself
The path to love clears up a monumental mistake
That someone out there is going to give or take something that is not already yours
When you truly find love, you find yourself
To realize ""I am love"" is not reserved only for those who marry
This is a universal realization cherished in every spiritual tradition
To put it most simply, all relationships are ultimately a relationship with God",rap

Thinking it was a trusty tree

So did my love prove false to me
Must I be bound, oh, and he go free?
Must I love one that don't love me ?
Why should I act such a childish part?
And love a man that will break my heart ?
There is a ship sailing on the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in

Typically served a twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday

In Saigon, a US miltary spokesman
Said today, more than 720 troops
Were killed last week in
That sensitive border area
In all of South Vietnam
The enemy lost a total of
2,689 soldiers

They won't forget what they've seen

Whose average was nineteen

Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post-traumatic stress disorder

Some succumb to suicidal thoughts

Raji, everything is poppin' man. You, you sir. Thank you for being here

[RAJITHEONE]
Man, thank you for having me

[Dj Steel]
Ayy man, it's-it's always a pleasure. Now listen, I want to jump right into it

[RAJITHEONE]
Okay

[Dj Steel]
Alright, 'cause, you just jumped on my radar
[RAJITHEONE]
Word

[Dj Steel]
Now from what I'm hearing from you, the songs that I've heard, I did my research. Super dope man. You a singer—

[RAJITHEONE]
Yeah

[Dj Steel]
Song writer—

[RAJITHEONE]
Yeah

[Dj Steel]
And a rapper—

[RAJITHEONE]
Bro you did your research for real

[Dj Steel]
Yeah, well that's just, that's just the tip of the ice burg, we just starting. So tell me man, where— Now I, I, I also read that you are from Chicago

[RAJITHEONE]
Yeah
[Dj Steel]
That's your hometown

[RAJITHEONE]
Yes, yes

[Dj Steel]
But you, you shouted out the 612

[RAJITHEONE]
You got to

[Dj Steel]
Is, is that your home?

[RAJITHEONE]
Uh, it was

[Dj Steel]
Okay

[RAJITHEONE]
Uh, we moved to Minnisota when I was a teenager, you know. More oppurtunities and resources to raise a family

[Dj Steel]
Okay, more peaceful?
[RAJITHEONE]
It was worth it for sure

[Dj Steel]
Alright that's dope, super dope. So, we from Chicago but we rep Minnesota as well

[RAJITHEONE]
Meen-E-sota

[Dj Steel]
Mina-Mina-Mina-Minasota. I always mess that up

[RAJITHEONE]
No, you said it right but I was mocking you low key

[Dj Steel]
Mina-Minasota

[RAJITHEONE]
Meen-ah-sota

[Dj Steel]
Okay, dope. Now, indie, signed? What's your situation?

[RAJITHEONE]
Indie... indie, for sure

[Dj Steel]
Okay

[RAJITHEONE]
Um, I was the guy who really... I'm the SoundCloud artist that everybody talks bad about

[Dj Steel]
You know, why do people do that? What's wrong with being a SoundCloud artist?

[RAJITHEONE]
Everyone, everyone's a critic so I don't, I don't take it personally

[Dj Steel]
Yeah

[RAJITHEONE]
'Cause, uh, SoundCloud helped pop my career off. I use SoundCloud to track my data analytics, and figure out my market, 'cause I was working. You know, it's a music business

[Dj Steel]
That's a business man, data-data analytics. I can dig that

[RAJITHEONE]
Yeah, but then it went viral on YouTube and Facebook on it's own. Like I didn't even upload it on those two platforms. Fans did it. But they named it, uh, ""Voicemails"" by Bryson Tiller and Drake. So back then, which was last... April, there was a huge anticipation for Drake and Bryson to do a collaboration

[Dj Steel]
Okay

[RAJITHEONE]
I was even anticipating it. But when the fan or whoever it was uploaded my record and titled it ""Voicemails"" featuring Bryson Tiller and Drake all the fans was like, ooh, we 'bout to listen. And they listened... but it was me. And I didn't know this until like a week in when I'm already at like a couple million streams on YouTube, like whoa

[Dj Steel]
I saw that... I saw that

[RAJITHEONE]
So I was like hold on let me look at this 15,000 comments. See what they got to say. And what I realized was regardless of who they thought it was, it was a hot record

[Dj Steel]
That's dope

[RAJITHEONE]
So #WHITEGIRLVOICE, from there, you know, it popped. It popped on Facebook again, another 10,000 comments I'm reading 'em. Just doing my research on myself. And then um, made that move to on, um, put it on 31 platforms via TuneCore

[Dj Steel]
Okay

[RAJITHEONE]
Which put it on Spotify

[Dj Steel]
Okay

[RAJITHEONE]
Spotify, it went viral again

[Dj Steel]
You gotta teach me analytics

[RAJITHEONE]
You know I'm still learning, but—

[Dj Steel]
That's the key man

[RAJITHEONE]
I took a leap of faith you know?

[Dj Steel]
Yeah

[RAJITHEONE]
Did it with my eyes closed, believed in myself, and... the fans, you know, they don't lie. And nor does numbers, so...

[Dj Steel]
Okay, well listen we gonna to get into something. We got RAJITHEONE in the building. It's the warm up live man, Sirius XM the Heat, Dj Steel",rap

That we were definately meant to be
Destiny, is the truth
We're the living, breathing proof
I wish only you and me could see, our future ain't no fantasy
But it all is just a dream, and we wake up from our sleep
And we are being carried by an angel from above
Takin us to another place where there is peace and love
From that point on, we can trust
No more of that dirty lust

Cause that's what i'm supposed to do
I feel like i'm approaching truth
And telling it what it's supposed to do

Is that what i'm supposed to say

Been sitting here, thinkin' about
The times we had, they were so great
But it makes me sad cause I realize that it's too late
I wanna restart right now, today
These words give me a huge toothache
I knew that i would soon pay
For all the shit I do-re
Yes, I believe in true fate
My heart is filled with love
But my mind is filled with hate
My mind must be playing tricks on me
This ain't no fucking game
I wish I could just explain
To myself, why i'm insane
God please just help me for goodness sake

And i'm looking at a dream
Beauty fills my heart

Holding up them dixie cups

Leaning in for our first kiss

When its singing man platinum crowned

I am not running for fame or for money
As too much really saying about it
All i do, feel my wave, but if truly
All of it i respect, cause its movings

I am not askin' forgive me, forget me
Cause not missing myself in that gambling
Always dissed myself, so what else man
Can be fatter,than self-madе brain aiming

All i bid on eight, i am hero
I am feel my height, and my gamе up
I can think like that just on minute
Cause again, i am then go in mirrors
Of my soul, and masks that i killing
Cause not dumby ass, i am figure
What myselflying gives, just a zero
And when i am mean it, i just mean it

In my star relations, i feel stagnation
If i am not in basin, feel no excitation
If organisation of my concert - budget
All organisation of my mind-soul - fun shit

No apologation, hate feel of no fountain
Cause that time i feel, should do i reconception
Should i record flame shine, to support connection
Of all life being session, yes, its price of patience

Of music producing, so sick it is
All my thoughts was, man, i can bigger do
No comparing here, rule competitive
So just bidding on eight, i am hero
I making and caking my wings on my kitchen
I think how relations relate to my people
Not breaking in making, so working like kiborg

The life hearing me, i am lot in that being
But not all that being really healthy for being
So leaving the shit,cause wan't see my family
I am hate being familiar, i am friend, not colleague

Do bigger than biggest, its living, for me just
Its my daily digest, newspapers - main titles
All it just a good news,about the releases
The fire can't be midget, if midget - it dies

So all i bid on eight, i am hero
I have bigger weight, when i get up
How all it relates, to my fellas
All i really saying, i not give up

Trying to pick up my pacе

C'mon I'm running latе
And I'm about to miss the train
To my prolonged fame
Do not close the gate
I'm almost on the stage

Living life shameless and painless
Aimless don't wanna be famous
Just spitting out phrases
Trying to remain stainless
Am stuck faithless
Still I ain't heinous
Don't like me kiss my anus
I ain't nothing like Bane is
No mask on any of our faces
Staying the same as
Before we're changeless
Chainless and changeless
Got no two cents to spare
We don't even care
We just go we just roll
Eatin cereal from a bowl
Without any milk, dad never came back home

So will have a bullet proof vest
Aim for the head and not for the chest
And if this is a game of chess
I'd be yelling check mate
A long time ago, this my home but I act like a guest

Y'all act like you own me, only,  putting me to test
Not giving me any rest but may I suggest
Instead of drowning me you actually invest in me
And I will leave you impressed
Showing you that I can be the best
All you gotta do is let me in the kitchen
And stop bitchin'
Let me cook my vision

Bars so hard even El Chapo wouldn't escape from this position

Into the school where the scholar is studying;
Leave not the bridegroom quiet - no happiness must he have now with his bride
Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain
So fierce you whirr and pound, you drums - so shrill you bugles blow

Beat! beat! drums! - blow! bugles! blow!
Over the traffic of cities - over the rumble of wheels in the streets;
Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses?
No sleepers must sleep in those beds --
No bargainers bargains by day - no brokers or speculators - would they continue?
Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?
Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?
Then rattle quicker, heavier drums -- you bugles wilder blow

Beat! beat! drums! - blow! bugles! blow!
Make no parley - stop for no expostulation
Mind not the timid - mind not the weeper or prayer
Mind not the old man beseeching the young man
Let not the child's voice be heard, nor the mother's entreaties
Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses
So strong you thump O terrible drums - so loud you bugles blow",pop

Decide to continue to decide to be careless before dawn
Would it continue to be this hard to understand you

And what if time ain't gonna last til november
Theres no thrill in wastecasing

Actors smell the pain in the soot
Takin a major route, tearin down a life stage or two
Always represent that route that you say you do

Should could be a way to prove
We need know it would happen within minutes, which is delay for you

Wearin some red string that i rubbed in Israeli dirt
And no i don't have the energy to leave this apartment
Cause we all know failing barely hurts
Hoping some day we can make this home full of home
Hone in on what we all know at the end of it
I hold the strength of a town of a hundred thousand
The president was dead when they found him
Leave left but never forget home
Giving me my hand to throw this stepping stone
Progress to process and hold
Never stop to get less than owed
And I would lick for a grin for a spit for a scream for a gnaw at an eye for an idea fading shortly
Some stumble into blazes of glory but I know
I know the corpse of the alligator tells a different story

Madness through the planlessness and if i plan less, fuck that
Refuse to be less than a man, one hand a metropolis, the other a ghost town
Wrists in charge of the sewer and the irrigation, elbows poke godlessness to God-fearing nations
Stop feeling anxious. May as well look at myself and say fuck feelings that i sanction

A duel, we're gonna have it out
Follow paths where the night lets you travel
Through frost and the echoing shouts
Ride alone and listen for reason
The wind whispers something to you
The son of a savage, the son of a snake
They had you for something to do
You've come close, the quillotine missed you
You ran from the Crown with their gold
The Round Table met, and chose me to find you
A chalenge is all you've been told
I wait alone, no armour to shield me
The thunder slows to a fade
My cold eyes staring to the edge of the silver
Lightning strikes the blade
The tension's in the air tonight
The night sky tempts the dare
I can feel the distant fight
You're nearing from out there
The silence of my second sight
Last rites, only fear
I'm young and you're old but the age doesn't matter
I'm hard, I can take it, the cold night drops the rain
Never question ontold secrets, never guess what you won't gain
I'm the lastting storm to break you, you'll swallow my sword and it's pain
I've longed for the moment with passion and fury
To watch as you cry out in pain
Take a last look at the sky when you've lost
When your shadow no longer remains
Our eyes meet as strangers, no fear of the dangers
The sparks kly, our swords strike as fire
All that you hear are your worst dying fears
Afraid of my passing desire
You drop from the dark, shaking from the answer
You strike to fight the sky, yes I'm in the way
It burns and takes all, life and what you wanted
Where's your spirit drifting, it's left you here to stay
I've longed for the fire that's burning towards you
The fool is caught in the flame
Take a last look at my eyes the reflection
Unreason is rising again
You've met the deadline, now back, to the king's wine
Ride and return what you stole
You'll never see, what the last rites can be
Last rites only fair to your soul
Daylight is breaking, I am alive, you've lost with no time to tell
The silence has faded, the Queen has arrived
They've witnessed your journey to hell
That lonely temper crawls, the loser's the first one that falls
First you feel pain then you feel nothing at all
The chains that bind you are held by the captor
The one you once tried to decieve
I head down the path where our challenge began
Take a last look as I leave

To The Bandusian Fountain

O thou fountain of Bandusia, clearer than glass, worthy of delicious wine, not unadorned by flowers; to-morrow thou shalt be presented with a kid, whose forehead, pouting with new horns, determines upon both love and war in vain; for this offspring of the wanton flock shall tinge thy cooling streams with scarlet blood. The severe season of the burning dog-star cannot reach thee; thou affordest a refreshing coolness to the oxen fatigued with the plough-share, and to the ranging flock. Thou also shalt become one of the famous fountains, through my celebrating the oak that covers the hollow rock, whence thy prattling rills descend with a bound.",misc

You're a melody

You taught me to dream
I'll give you everything I am and still fall short of

What’s it gon’ be when unemployed person wake up in the a.m?

[ Verse 1 : WillFake ]
Go to the club last night, get drunk, they say what they do is right
But it goes worse by takin’ a morphin and Bintang
On the way, poppin’ a pill and addin’ a beer again
Smash the liquor store’s door, take a Green Sand by the hand
Sack of tortillas and Mr. Potatoes, go insane with some Oreos
Eyes get reddish, act childish, be nudist, how can they go birthday suit?
Skittish? Go home by a Sevilles, put a Nutella inside a Tupperware
The most luscious food to supper when there isn’t spaghetti
Eat it in front of your Apple then shoot the bread, post it too, wait
HBO? There is Poseidon, livin’ like nob and posh, bitch, ooh!
They’re famished again, eat Swedish Fish, they want again
Dessert for now’s Dunkin Donuts with a jug of pure milk or Bebelac
Throw the junk into Cadillac, sleep blindfold after kick moccasin off
Inner man works bad again, they think that they need more cuisine
So put an ecstasy inside a moccachino, wake up naked
They’re sleepwalkin’, wank a dick, they’re hangover
Police then came over the houses, they find gun gone
‘Cause the fam next door calls 911
Flee away with a ganja on, strong acid alcohol
They’re tryna rob the IMF, they say “ I am F-U-C-K-ing robber! “
“ Yeah, are you seeing robber? “, a cop said towards a paid rover ( No! )
They burp ‘cause of Coca Cola, no luck on it, get saltpeter with Tolak Angin
Get lost at sea, get mal de mer, get ashtma, feel like Voldemort
Swallow a Fisherman’s Friend for them all, “ I’m a hog-wild! “, so fuck them all!
They get drunk again, they need to see weed again, they need a Tae Ken Noi
Totter in the candy shop, meet a tot, say “Hi!” and toy him
Find a place with the GPS on Huaweii (yeah)
I holler, “Aloha!” like they’re in Hawaii
Singin’ “Some Ways To Murder My Dad” , B-Ly belied, wait
It’d be lunchtime at McDonald while watchin’ Donald got t-triumph

Hurry up! We get hurly-burly, so

[ Verse 2 : B-Ly ]
Hot and cold, went to the boulevard, drunk as hard, got maag
Snatchin’ women’s Louis Vuitton, sleep back to the Hilton Hotel
Chloride acid growin’ up, pukin’ in the toilet, add a TP
Take a shower, masturbate, look at Fashion TV
Settled down, chimichangas on the rack, shit, I have my bakery’s back
Snappin’ tortillas, grab the Sprite, what the fuck my stomach like?
I add a dozen of Mentos, saltpeter, destroy fan with a Quaker
Backup to Lakers, cops pulled me over, I’m in a cell ‘cause I left to the stadium with a jagger
Home, I recovered this problem, showin’ up my license
That sheriff told me I drove drunk, steer backwards, park my Cooper on the roof
Poof, I prove that I made a homicide while I walk up to the Walmart
Ripped out German shepherd’s head, gave it to a kid
He cried, ran, train bumpin’ him, so I laugh and scatter brains
And that’s when a tourist from Paris asked me where the fuck is the laundry
And I didn’t say anything, “ Baise qui merde, encule! “, took his arms, electrocute him
Boot skateboarders’ legs, fags, chillin’ and chitchat
I kick cat by the time I ate Kitkat, bumpin’ “Karl Meyer”
Call a department store to just say, “Fuck you, asshole! Good morning!”
So moaning like a baby in trampoline with Mamy Poko Pants on, tanned and stunned
I spitted out a lollipop sweet to the hermaphrodite out on street
Sandpaperin’ my duff, looked clean with a fistful of facial foam
Face full of special Koko Krunch, havin’ a loco brunch
I’ma type off  “goodbyecruelworld”, fuck it, I’m exhausted, drowsy
Blew out a Dunlop, yo, it takes a fun a lot! I’m Eveready in the back of the coupe

If only just one minute more

I live above the surface
Don’t like to venture down
I guess I’m scared what I might find
But when you pull me closer
The walls are toppled over
Theres nothin’ I can do but cry

In memory forever
In dreams and imagination

Hurts as if a piece of my life has vanished
Dismal thoughts of desolation

I cry my tears for the loss of my everything

Every thought traced back to you
Have you ever breathed the air I breathe

Why you're giving up heaven for me

You know I heard this track in the car today on radio 1
And I thought - you know what?! This would be good for a revision rap!
But, the exams tomorrow so I thought, I'll quickly whip this out, put it out tonight and take it off tomorrow!

[Verse]
Tomorrow is the day of the exam for igcse
People been messaging me all day like Mc Bruff help me please
Bank holiday revision won't you just help me
OK, let's see

Extended - start with question 1

If you want 20 out of 20, for marks to be full it
Means you got to give equal balance to each of the three bullets
One and to are explicit - the info is easy to find
But for that third bullet point, you've got to put in the hard work and grind
That third bullet point, the info for that one is hidden and
Implicit
If you ain't prepared for that, bruv you gonna miss it
Try to find 5 things for each, then put them into your own words
Don't worry about finding synonyms for everything - just focus on the verbs
Remember timing: there's only 45 minutes for the question
That means you gotta be concise, no time to waste on messing
Question 2 is 30 minutes, language analysis like we all know
But with 8 quotes to analyse, you can't afford to be slow
Choose your quotes carefully - no marks if you got the wrong ones
Define the literal meaning, then explain the advanced connotation

Question 3 is the easiest find 15 things in the source you can take a quote directly, the words don't  even have to be yours
Then on the 3b you summaries the whole lot in your own words
3b's only worth 5 marks, just do it in a quick burst
3as the most important, for 15
But it's not actually as easy as it seems
7 or 8 will come easy, the rest are implicit again
Spend  time looking hard - there's easy marks to gain

You may not like it... But... Play it again!",rap

I remember the first time
When we've glimpsed of each other
Your eyes, the flames, I'll remember'em forever
You looked like an angel among the cats of hell
I felt you were the one that I wanted, oh well

I remember the first date when we've met each other
Your words, your smell, I'll remember'em forever
We walked through the night on the roofs of Budapest
And something has moved in my chest

Your burning eyes - Are shining bright through the night

I remember the first night that we've spent together
Your voice, the dark, I'll remember'em forever
An hour like a moment, I felt I was in heaven
With you my babe, with you my kitten

Time is running but your eyes are still shining
When you look into the night the moon is rising
I'm ready to throw my 9th live for you, my babe
My fears have passed away
Your burning eyes - Are shining bright through the night",pop

Have you ever been in love with someone you never met
Perhaps she is the one you made up when you were ten
Imagining that kiss and tears are welling up within
Cause she never made the ball and so I face the wall again
But my songbird sings with the name Regina
Her voice reminds me of pain, pleasure, leisure
In pictures mad mean, she's a lovely creature
I wish to meet her one day, to smile and be shy

[Eligh]
I've been touched by the way you sing as I know so many agree
As I lower this pen to paper to search for something to say to a crush!
Your voice it trances and dances across my eardrums like brush
In the Sierra it's not, lust just a playful measure to send
And I'ma sing through this and my pipe issuing that light
To might crown that emotion that rush in on brow
To call myself a fan, a Music Man to my essence
From the cheap seats of retreat for me on my plane rides home from my shows
And anxiety strikes, but your playful personality
Exudes common interludes to life for me to smile to
So I'd like to take a while to, say
I got a crush on you
[Chorus]

[Eligh]
A songbird sings with the name Regina
Her voice reminds me of pain, pleasure, leisure
In pictures mad mean, she's a lovely creature
I wish to meet her one day, to smile and be shy

I'm relatively late when it comes to knowing your career
But I know my ears do not lie to me and the words you write are clear
And your focus is quite embarrassing really but I'm not shy
And I'm like ""Why am I shy with pen?"" I let it go then I fly by night
And find you remind you your voice is special then pleasing
Inside it's easing in fact, intriguing that's why I manifest
This meeting - just a spirit admiring from a distance
Start fire pistons off my engine revs for you

By Alfie NGO

VERSE 1
I had a vision, you were telling me to come back to the brighter side
Tell me to focus on the whispers,I won’t try
I’m just to focus on my sight but I refuse to cry
I’m not a warrior, nor survivor, I am not really good at that, I need you and I really need to admit that
So father forgive your son,I am ready to fight, tonight..I’m almost there...

VERSE 2
I had a vision
Was falling down, you re the one bring me back to life, I don’t deserve it but God you are known for that, I need more patience and you re the only one to get that

CHORUS
I’m almost there.. I’m almost there
Pray harder
Fight harder
Love harder
Speak louder  x3
He’s the one, the only one, that will heal
He’s the one, the only one, who’s still here
Acknowledge it, be more aware of the miracles
Brought to you life, restored your heart, the only one

BRIDGE 1
John 11,35 He is the resurrection and the life,  the one who believes in him will live and trust me but they’ll die and whoever lives by believing in him will never die x3

She was livin' in the melting pot

Get yourself a weapon
'Cause they slice you up in the melting pot
Well, I don't really have time to talk
But I wish you lots of luck in the melting pot

The heartbreak, the laughter has all been in vain
Beat up and lied to
For your whole life
Kick you in the head
In the melting pot

Well, the hawks live upstairs
Where the air is clean in the melting pot
They like to swoop down
And gnaw on your brain in the melting pot
Money, sex and power
Jerk you off in the back seat of the melting pot
Then they say I saw you last night
And you sure were looking sweet in the melting pot

And in the end it's always just some game
The heartbreak, the laughter has all been in vain

If they possibly can in the melting pot

Keep you bleeding, begging and snotty here

Well, don't you dare laugh out loud
They'll take away what you got
In the melting pot

The heartbreak, the laughter will all have been in vain

Things being like this why won't you just let me know?
My lifes like a record that is spinning too slow
Listen up cause the radio is playing our song
My heart beats on, it lasts too long
Change my file change my style then just say its okay
Leave tonight say goodbye or just put up a fight
Chances are i'll watch the stars from my bedroom window
I'll point out satellites and kiss the girl goodnight
I'll point out satellites, kiss the sky goodnight
I hate saying goodbye you know I don't want to go
Before it all fades away there's one last thing you should know
I regret the times that we never shared
I regret never saying I cared
Change my file change my style then just say its okay
Leave tonight say goodbye or just put up a fight
Chances are i'll watch the stars from my bedroom window
I'll point out satellites and kiss the girl goodnight
I'll point out satellites and kiss the sky goodnight
And kiss the sky goodnight
And kiss the sky goodnight
And kiss the sky goodnight

[Verse 1: Mikey Omega]
Have you ever entered into a deep depression
Caused by anger and aggression
Unwanted feelings consuming you whole
A sudden change in attitude takes toll
The weight it holds from the thoughts unfold
Is like a pile of stones on your dome
I feel so empty and alone
The night brings deep thoughts to the surface
Tears might shed as your conscious tells you that you're worthless
I've tried many supplements to postpone this
But the reality is sadly that I must face it
The slow silence slivers like a serpent striking the subconscious mind
The dark distortion of the blind brings it all in line
Oh how I despise the dark depression of the night

[Hook: Killa Con]
There's always a thousand thoughts
Racing inside my mind
Every second in time
Nothing is pure but the pain
All is contaminated
All is contained
Innocence is gone
Nothing pure but the pain x2
[Verse 2: Mikey Omega]
Chariots of fire, pools of blood
A torn hearts desire caused by a falling dove
I go head to head against the anti-Christ
Leaving it all to chance like a roll of the dice
I attract bolts of misfortune like a lightning rod
I live life at the hands of an angry God
I hover over the fire pits as I await my judgement
The souls of the righteous & wicked turnin to dust is violent
St. Peter speaks out
Forgiveness pleads out my silent mouth
But the deaf ears of Heaven doubt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mikey Omega]
See I can't be in the belly of the beast
Cause even he didn't want me
The devil himself spat me back out and said damn that's rotten
There's no love here kids
I'm Gods forgotten
The world is so small compared to the sun
An eclipse turns the Earth dark like the inside of a barrel of a gun
I feel the same way
I'm Gods forgotten son
I roam the streets alone cause in this world of many
I am but just one

On the wings of a dream
Sail away leave today
In a sea of light
And flow with the stream
Once we've made friends
Don't pretend that we won't meet again
I will be tied to your tracks
I can change your attitude
Sweeten up the bitter fruit
Let me put a spell on you
For a little while

You'll be safe in my control
I got you in a stranglehold
I'll free your mind and steal your soul
I can make you smile

Release me and feel me - Let me seduce you

Destination Paradise kiss the sky
Flying high tonight
On the wings of a dream
Sail away leave today
In a sea of light
And flow with the stream
If you want more
I'll be there at the end of the straw
I'm your drug I'm a rock
Cut me up make me in - Take me

Now they say you're sugar free
Won't you drop a line for me
And how is your morality
Now that you've come clean
Do you still have confidence
Can you face the consequence
Don't you see it never ends

Your life will be wasted like mine

Her pleadings have all been in vain

Alone I will cross the divide
But bury me there by my sweetheart
To sleep through the years by her side

Oh mother I'll go with the dawn

Wallets getting thicker going step by step, But keep it moving now we started never gonna see me rest
No stress, stayin high off the dense ass nug, Jumping on my oppertunitys like killing a bug
No love for these wanna be thugs that just blush when you call em out for giving you shit they say what? (say what?)

So lemme tell you bout the night that I had thought about quitting
I was in my room just writing shit, laid back sitting
And thinking I don't wanna share these beats with other rappers and I don't wanna be the main source of someone else's laughter
In a negative manner, light my temper like banner
Cause I refuse to be another victim of society
That's why I target my moves and make them quietly
Cause I am too afraid to fucking fail
But if I go in I might as well
Go in full throttle, live my life with no regrеts
That's my motto and I find it condescending
Constantly defеnding. My name and what i stand for
But what do I stand for ? Well I guess that's 42
Universal, existential gotta tap my full potential
If I really wanna make it, promise that I will not fake it
No I ain't bout busting caps or slinging drugs in my free time
But you got me fucked up if you think that Ima be fine
With being labeled as a lesser rapper for going my own direction
Correction, I might me named after a saint but ya boy isn't so holy
Trying to change to be a better person I refuse to be the old me
That's why I just can't quit, I got others depending on me
Your baby boy isn't so little anymore mommy
I'm trying to take care of you, just like you took care of me
So don't take it personal this pen and paper are my therapy
Literally the definition of always being there for me
They tell you from a young age to go and chase your dreams
Then wanna get mad as hell, when they see you do these things
Yeah I dropped out of college, guess that move was pretty bold
But with faith in my decision I might too find the city of gold
So let's re-arrange that false statement and paint it with the words that someone else has paid with. Cause it's so easy to start but hella
Tough to finish. Thought by now it'd be over like some silly game of scrimmage, really cut me deep. Had all of my dreams diminished
But then I thought about the image and the greater glory
To this story see I don't know where I'm going but I know for a fact that I won't be boring. Shoutout David Bowie, shoutout if you don't know me but are listening anyways. Yeah I've had better days but all jokes aside. No more telling myself these lies
My life will not suffice if I choose to compromise
For anything other than this, life's too short I can't dismiss
Up my dream cause this music be my calling, so I'm making sure that
Young MIC can go all in
Cause if I can wake up then my head can stay up
And my chain stay glistening, shining on the path to anyone listening
Yea to anyone listening

For only one quick moment of relief
Before the bloodlust returns to rule me
And all control is returned to Him

I set my final plan into motion
All the answers becoming so clear
Retreating back to my cave
I scale its sides in a desperate attempt to reach its peak
Eyes fixated on the rotting husk of a fallen tree

I must ascend
I must bind my form

Willpower dwindling
I feel my grasp slipping away

He returns to further enslave me
He returns with an urge to eat

I pull the sinews out from within my leg
This duality is overwhelming me
I stretch the tendons and begin to wrap my body
Tying myself to the tree

With only moments to spare
I surrender myself

This marks the end of an era
A plague of darkness now meets its demise

As the sun rises, it’s fiery gaze fixated on me
It purges deeply

Incinerating every inch of me
I reside here now

Don't mess with a bitch hang with Hitch that's a fix
They either motivate or drain so be wise when you pick
Hopefully this gets to you through the bullshit so thick

Never discriminate cause I don't hate you catch my drift?

I'm the M-A-C and the K-E-R and the rest is M-O-E (Uh huh!)
So won't you get off of your rump and onto the floor
And y'all get a-ready to party (Oh yeah!)
'Cause ain't nothin' like a party that's all the way live
While the women move their bodies and move their thighs
Like a fly guy dancin' 'til he fly away
With a fly girl that's leadin' the way
[?] flashing, that's right on time
To the funky, funky beat that's blowing your mind
To all you party people [?]
Take you on a [?] that's right on time
No need for reservations or invitations
Invite family friends or any relations
Said all aboard to the funk dance floor
And when you get there I'm gonna mack some more
[Verse 5]
Forget about the rappers that you have known
The King Gigolo is on the microphone
I'm DJ Flash of the west
And I'm the one who says it best
This here jam is all the way live
With Dark Star and the disco lights
Just pop-lock while you're on the floor
Get what you paid that money for
Then do the freak to your favorite beat
Work up a sweat in the disco heat
Get sweaty while you dance and dance while you sweat
It's a all night party you'll never forget
We're Dark Star, we get you every time
We do it with the beat and deathly rhyme
We're not from the East and I'm here to warn you
We're straight from the heart of California

[Verse 6]
Party people just scream, party people just clap
Just listen to my voice and my Westside rap
Just shift your shoulders, bend your knees
And if you think you're too bad I'll make you eat cheese
Back to back, hip hop on the stand
I rap so good I disturb the band
Then dance your dance, shake you legs
Watch all the fellas turn their heads
They're bad, it's about that time
We started at 10, let's end at 9
Now all you girls with all the fat
You got to go to Jack LaLanne and do jumpin' jacks
(Two, four, six, eight!)
You go two, four, six, eight
A-this is the way you lose your weight
[Verse 7]
Well I was cruising down the street on a Saturday night
Then a cutie pie came into my sight
So I stopped the car, called her over to me
I said ""You sweet, fine thing, I'm Lovin' C""
She said ""I know who you are and I know your type
It's against your law to treat a lady right""
I said ""No, no, baby, that ain't it
I only drop a girl when she starts to trick
You can't know my type, 'cause I'm a one and only
If I treat a girl wrong that means she's a phony
She only wants money and plays hard to get
But don't no girl take me through no ego trip
I'm just chillin' out, living my life
It's gonna be awhile until I take a wife
So come on babe, stick with me tonight
I promise to your [?] I'll treat you right""",rap

Just in time to see the lord of death rise

One tender kiss to ease the pain

You wouldn't think I could [unintelligible]
This little girl couldn't remember them

We sang a song, sang it all night long

We sounded confused, stoned a bit
But made the best instead

But I never want to face anything ever again
And it's painfully beautiful that I am alive
That I can feel your movement away
Like push pins in my feet
You've forced my eyes open and made me see
All of the beauty that is you in front of me
And then it's apparent that you are lost and you are free
And you won't stay with me in this ephemerality
It's cinematic gold
You'll never get old

Aiyo, we night breathe, move through the night at light speed
With Timb's on, baggy denims and white tees
We rest inside our tents, with Mr. Lightly
The right trees turn my eyes to Chinese
Then speak like Israelite, become Christ
A crown of thorns placed on my head and gun fights
Escape through the night, for holdin' my sons tight
Chased by shadows, runnin' towards the lights
Relatin' to pharaohs, I speak from peace pipes
Each night, then you burn all friends of 'dro
Givin' praises due, abundance of dough
Held by the ebony prince, heavenly set
Down to the streets where we plan our revolt
Amongst strangers, and clouds of weed smoke
Addicts and heartless that love to deep throat
I sit amongst goons, gangsta, ex-felons
Ex-cons, addicts discussin' our rebellion
On the phone with reverends, holdin' up my weapons
Waitin' for the beast to set off Armageddon

Nigga, wanna act up, nigga get clapped up, what
It's too militant, throw your fists high

It's too militant..
I shoot through trench coats, don't trust kin folks
Keep my friends close, so I can watch 'em
Through hard laughter, never know what he's plottin'
Hunger, then he slipped his hands in your pockets
Clip your wallets, it's nothin' personal, it's just projects
Watchin' a videotape of Christopher Wallace
Footage exposed, bullet holes in the side of his jeep
We hold it in, 'til we collide with police
Ride for 2Pac, and all the soldiers every been shot
Though they body rot, they spirit rest inside of my pen
Each of 'em tune in, I write the Blueprints that's Stillmatic
Build with Arabs, my mic can heal the masses
Or feel the caskets, I studied the books of Iron Octopus
Ladies ride the hook, niggas spit the verses
A pit of serpents, stand and curved in a s shape
Then I make your death date
I'm hell spawned, drawn near the Hell's gate
The Indian lady warned me an old man, with pale face
She said ""Fork tongue make painful kisses
And Priest, when you talk, all the angels listen""

But I kind of like it
I kind of miss it
I can't fight it so I'll tell her when I see her
I'm changing my demeanor
To a nice guy who can capsize under pressure
A pint size to a flatline on a stretcher
A path wide enough to fit all my love
You got me feeling like an amateur
You got types of nerve to cap on my words
So give me your worst
I wanna hit that curve

Run fast up your cardio
Chase you, how far will I go to get my heart back?
Backtracked to when you fell back to my arms attached to your waist

Run back, make you fall in love and then leave
Make up, said fuck you, stay in my dreams
Can I get a fee for the rent please?
Bought new locks and changed all the keys
'Cause I'm far from over it
Got a new plane ticket and I'm tossing over it to an airline lady
And I'm crossing over it
Checked my bags, your heart's still holding it
Take off, lift off, took off, wait no, I'm not done, still in love
Like I'm falling out a jet

Left my broken heart open

SCENE ONE
[WOMAN]
Hey, you got a cigarette I can use?

[JEFFREY]
Sure.

[WOMAN]
Thanks... not everyone in the city would help a stranger out.

[JEFFREY]
What do I look like, a member of Smash Mouth?

[WOMAN]
Yeah, Smash Mouth fucking sucks!

(takes a drag)

[JEFFREY]
Hey, what's your name?

[WOMAN]
My real name's Starstreak - but I like to be called Phoenix.

[JEFFREY]
Those sound like two equally interesting names.
[PHOENIX]
Oh, I'm very interesting! I do many interesting, druggy things. I guess you could say is, my life philosophy is:

I
Just wanna fly

(runs to Jeffrey)

Put your arms around me, baby!
Put your arms around me, baby!

SCENE TWO

[JEFFREY]
(to the audience)
Phoenix was everything I needed, but didn't know I needed. Impulsive. Passionate. Two interesting names. We spent three blissful weeks doing nothing but making love and talking about our mutual hatred of Smash Mouth.

Everything was great... until the day that everything went wrong.

[PHOENIX]
Come with me, Jeffrey.

[JEFFREY]
Phoenix, where are you taking me? This is the bad part of town, it creeps me out...

Shut the door, baby

Welcome to... a drug party!

It's a party where we do drugs - illegal drugs! Hahaha!

I just want to be left alone

Can't relate!
No time out
To hesitate
To my head

Touch my face
Two steps back

You're in my space!

(They groan contentedly)

[JEFFREY]
(to the audience)
I love that song. It's a very underrated track off the album ""14:59""!

Phoenix, did those people all just shoot heroine into their butt cracks?

[PHOENIX]
Yeah! Shooting heroine into your butt gets the drugs into the stream quicker - the blood... stream, that is!

[JEFFREY]
Phoenix, you're in too deep with this crowd! Let me help you! I can take you to a place or somewhere where they can get you clean!

[PHOENIX]
No, no! You just can't handle it! 'Cause my 'tude is so hot... I might as well be walking on the sun!

It ain't no joke-

[JEFFREY]
(suddenly)
NO! NO! NO!!!

Walking on the sun?! How could you say such a STUPID thing?! IT'S A STUPID METAPHOR AND IT DOESN'T HOLD UP!!!

You have a drug problem that needs to be addressed! Let me help you!

Fuck you, I'm going back into the club!

[JEFFREY]
No!

By herself
No one's there to talk or understand

Dries her eyes
Finds herself

No.

[JEFFREY]
Wow.

You really just Smash Mouth'd my heart.

And by that I mean you ruined it.

Like Smash Mouth ruined music...

Runaway, runaway

[JEFFREY]
Runaway, runaway

Hold on you tomorrow
But I'm leaving today
But I'm leaving today

But I'm dying

Today...

(Phoenix slowly collapses into a heap)

(The ensemble gathers around, upset)

[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #3]
Starstreak and/or Phoenix!

[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #1]
Guys, I think she overdosed on butt heroine.

[ENSEMBLE MEMBER #2]
And also, she had AIDS the whole time!

(gasps of shock)

(Jeffrey runs in)

[JEFFREY]
No, it can't be true! She can't be dying!

(Enter a drag queen, Butterfly)

[BUTTERFLY]
It is true!

I found her in the park, huddled under a tree!

[JEFFREY]
Thank you for bringing her to me, Butterfly. You've been an integral part of this story that no one will ever forget.

[BUTTERFLY]
I know! I left my butterfly wings a long time ago! Now my character arc is complete! Okay?

(As Jeffrey holds Phoenix in his arms:)

[JEFFREY]
Someday
When my life has passed me by
I'll lie around and wonder why
You were always there
For me

[BUTTERFLY]
(highly emotive)
One word
In the eyes of a passerby
I'll look around for another truth
And I'll fade away...

(Phoenix slowly rises from the floor - now an angel, saying goodbye to Jeffrey)

[ENSEMBLE]
Just close your eyes, and I'll take you there
This place is warm without a care
Take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave as you reach
For
Me

Will I find my way, will things finally change
A winter of chasing down empty promises long gone

Beyond it is another dimension
A dimension of sight
A dimension of sound
A dimension of mind

You're moving through a land of both shadow and substance
Of things and ideas
Guiding you through this wondrous journey
Is the hypnotic sound of the twilight tone

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh
Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From a mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Hearin' the twilight, twilight tone
Unpretentious girl from Memphis
Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
A signpost up ahead is calling
Through the mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, ba da, loo da, ba da loo da
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight tone

Submitted for your approval
One Mr. Miller, who's about to take a trip into oddness and obsolescence
Through a zone whose boundaries are that of imagination
Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing
Sound of the Twilight Tone

On a cold & rainy night
One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play that beat, oh, oh
Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone
Hearin' the twilight (repeat many times)

One that made you have to say goodbye

To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I wish I was him

If you told me to die for you, I would

We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

He looked alive, and alive he felt
He made the house with the cards he was dealt
Young man on a winding road, he’s mad at the way that he’s got to go slow
He looked so gone and he felt so cold
But he’d rather make a house with his cards then fold

Gazing up at the stars looking deep into his life
And in the dark, he saw the light, he saw the spark that set a fire so bright
Young man walking through an empty field
He frees all the things that he kept concealed
He lost his strength; he fell to the ground, all the weight on his shoulders was bringing him down

Sin is so deceiving only sweet just for a season (x4)
Break:
Pulls, Fools, slaves... takes you further than you wanna (x2)

Verse:
Started in Garden of Eden, Leading to deeds in secret
Never was what it looked like, the serpent and was just speaking
Oh no! That's FOMO, so the forbidden was eaten
Oh no! We’ve got no clothes; thought Elohim couldn't see it
Sin just care of what you're missing out on
You can choose the inputs can’t pick the outcome
So never trust a snake in a tree
Even Judas went and snaked thеn got the Lord staked in a tree (loud)
Sin could give high plеasures, leave behind addictions
It could give 'Hi' gestures for your blind affections
So you leave behind measures built on firm convictions
Now you're on your trimester while the Mister's missing
We’ve got angry single parents and their tingle parents
One; you could tell is missing; one's a Television
Unless the blood of Jesus breaks the curse existing;
Viscous cycles propagate cos you ain't any different
Preacher please be quiet mate don't kill my vibe mate
I tell her he's another primate looking for prime mates
Early doors you got the rapid como vai
Now he takes his time, to reply; that's a vai late
If every species evolved for the better
Then give my mandem on the block skins tougher than kevlar...... word;
With neck muscles to make a blade break
Vicky would have seen Riccardo after daybreak
You see God had died so that we qualify
And our future's less random than free Spotify
With sin we're all X'd; if not for the cross
Blood buying up our flaws with Love that's Sin Buy Your tick
The 1st Adam was a Leg, the fall of man was the leg-acy
Then the son of man came in secondary and took our blemishes
So we can overcome sin & its compelling sweetness
Then we can make the finish line and not in Helsiniki",rap

Peer back, back at the choices you’ve made
Reveal omissions, engage the aspects left behind

Your schemes will no longer persuade

Broke out into commonality
With intentions of preeminence

When will they ever rule once more

Under the moon its sickly glow
The winds of death they blow so cold
We set upon the sun, to leave behind this day
As we let our dreams just fade away
I left upon the day of sorrow in her arms our last embrace
Our figures pass in fleeting moments I wipe the tears from her face
Eyes of stone and burning bridges the hour soon draws near
Cast away this earthly vessel for I know no more fear

Police searchin' me lookin' for work but I was cheekin' that
Was on that block every night gettin' to that bag
Wanted that Gucci and Versace s*** Biggie had
Cookin' that cocaine til it turned hard
I'm livin' in hell still believing in God
I got faith like i'm Frank White
Fiends don't want that work if it ain't right
N****'s don't want you comin' up if they ain't eatin'
The block jumpin' i'm out here I ain't leavin'
I'm poppin' I ain't one of these lame n****'s
Me and Carmelo Anthony f***ing the same strippers
Going hand to hand is what made me a boss
I know how to bounce back after takin' a loss
See Trump got his trial and the b****'s in court
Judge made them realize they ain't as tough as they thought
Bodies done drop for this money I got
I earned these diamonds that I got on my watch
I earned these diamonds that I got on my chain
I treated myself for puttin' in all of that pain
(Hook: Que Banz)
I can't trust these n****'s they be switchin' sides
Trappin' in the bando with yo b**** inside
Money new hunnid's blue I just spent a dime
Me and you are not the same we on a different time x3
Try and 9 me when you find me better grip yo 9
Patek Philippe Avianne we on a different time

(Verse 2: Don Q)
I just wanna open this up tellin' y'all i'm opening up
I wanna be able to smell it before I open it up
That s*** ain't pourin' enough I be plottin' low in the cut
Lookin' at the TV like that's supposed to be us
But who am I to blame i'm still a student of the game
I maneuver out the ring and bring my shooters when I came
I need a b**** that's a down one when them pounds come
Make this outta town one don't leave til your rounds done
Time to time I still chop it up with the old heads
They told me how most n****'s snitch when you go fed
Told me to switch the hustle the flow dead
My brother pop died in Flodeg you ain't quote dead
Times I still wish I had a brick for the coke heads
Pull up with a mountain of snow and tell'em go sled
Remember Halloween's back when we used to throw eggs
Still in Moped's gave a f*** what the pope said
N**** which one you happen to pick
Judge by 12 or carry by 6
Grandad said ""be careful with the drugs don't let'em defeat you""
I said ""I don't do the drugs I just sell them to people""
He told me ""it's cold up when you going up""
Couple n****'s come through and see how you holdin' up
B****'s on your cell war that you was holdin' up
Give us some time them packages and them b****'s start slowin' up
(Hook: Que Banz)
I can't trust these n****'s they be switchin' sides

Floating in a trance like state, bewitched by the chanting
Masked faces far below me, laughing mockingly

She say's: ""help is too late when the memory doesn't remain""

There's a young boy driving
And he really wants a feature
Then I told the boy
You can never get it from me
I can't even write a verse for my family for free
Never know what to say
When I smoke the trees
Looking back on a time
I could barely even breathe
Suffocated by the smoke and the pressure
Lines of depression
Was it really worth all the pleasure?

It's all right, all right
I'm gonna switch up
Kinda feeling in the mood to really slap a bitch up
Go and get your niche up
Speak up

You don't want your past back in line with the dig up
Big ups, to the man that passed me the figure
Big bang when the finger pressed on the trigger
Damn
I ain't mean to cause so much chaos
Guess I really can't take a day off
Throw me in the Caucasian chasm
Gunshot spasm
Tell me if I got all the Karens, the Beckys
Bloodstain all on my khakis, tacky
None of your words can affect me
Fuck that, tag me
Tag another one of your besties
Do I really sound that petty?

Just a matter of time (Yeah)
Just a matter of time

Just a matter of time before I had to let loose
In this moment in time I wish I hadn't met you
Man you fuck with my heart I'm here to tell you the truth
I got played from the start I didn't have no clue
Sometimes, I just gotta think about it
Was it worth the heartbreak and the pain in my body
Was it worth the time and the dimes in my pocket
Was it just a waste of my life and my spirit
She a queen, like she from the magazine
Always called her Roxanne, she will never love me
Couldn't really understand why she wasn't into me
Never thought that one day she would turn into my enemy
All the pain you brought, you know that its killing me
If I played my cards right maybe you'd be into me
Didn't wanna try that's why I don't give no sympathy
Wasted all my time wish you said you wasn't into me

Okay the world's quite a scary place now, for a child
I always see the pain that resides, inside of, other people
Never catch the sequel, cause by the that time you do, they had probably gone and passed on to another life
It's a short while here
Looking up, asking god, what's the reason I am here
Is it to, make the world a better place, or is it to celebrate, our existence
Never really was good with trick questions
Like the dark knight when he fights Riddler on missions
Perspective is what's missing
People all over the world fighting with the system
Struggling to get what they deserve
They have been misheard
Hear it in the streets
My brothers getting locked up for false misdemeanors
While politicians get to eat good with their children
Now tell me, who's the real criminal
But they say it's for the people
The pain we go through is subliminal
And its subjective to the individual
P-A-I-N, every-one has their own demon that they're fighting
So be careful with the words that you choose to say
Everything has a right time, and a place
It's okay to take it slow, this is not a race
Remember you are living for your sake
Everything is gonna be okay
She a queen, like she from the magazine (Had to let loose)
Always called her Roxanne, she will never love me (Hadn't met you)
Couldn't really understand why she wasn't into me (Tell you the truth)
Never thought that one day she would turn into my enemy
All the pain you brought, you know that its killing me
If I played my cards right maybe you'd be into me (My life and my spirit)
Didn't wanna try that's why I don't give no sympathy
Wasted all my time wish you said you wasn't into me

Just a matter of time (Like she from the magazine, yeah yeah, why she wasn't into me)
Just a matter of time (Yeah, yeah)",rap

I remember the first, the first day we met
The first kiss,the first touch we've ever had
I tried to ignore everything
I can't hold my heart,Even to stop my feelings
My heart is bleeding
I can't talk , I can't walk, I can't think clearly
I can't sleep during the night, I tried Everything
I can't help myself, Everyday I pray 4 you and I to be together
We deserve each other, believe me we have a future together
No matter what happens , maybe I was jealous and over reacted
I confess I will confront you and fall down on my knees and say give me another chance

CHORUS×2

It isn't good to be lonely
Let us be toget her 4ever
I'll never hurt you again
Please give me another chance
VERSE 2

You are the one and only who can heal me
Together we can fulfil our dreams, No one can stop us
I'm crazy about you, but I'll never commit suicide
I'm man enough not stupid at all
I can't believe what happened
My heart always mention your name
My minds picturing you
Please sunshine tell me  what  can I do to persuade you
I tried to convince  myself
You know me exactly,  stop playing hard to get
No one can treat you the way I used to
I'll confront you and fall down on my knees and say give me another chance

Chorus×2

VERSE 3

To be together again is a good thing
The angels will smile and shake tears
Our ancestors will blow the whistles
Our Enemies will drink and drive
In order to commit suicide
I can't wait to hold you in my arms again
I missed Everything,  you are too hot and Intelligent
My beautiful you look like monalisa
Your smile heals, your kiss is like a tablet that makes me calm
Love you 4ever sunshine together , happy days 4ever
I'll thank our heavenly father for everything
Please mama girl give me another chance

It isn't good to be lonely
Let us be together 4ever

I’m sending you a sunset
Wishing you were here with me
When I close my eyes I can almost see your silhouette
I want your heart to know that my heart will never forget
So I’m sending you a sunset

To the sound of the busy streets
It’s just a matter of time
Until the city shines
And you're tangled up in the sheets

I love this picture, I just sent to you

Took a pill just to help the pain
Swim for miles to get away
Just to sink underneath the waves
Catch my breath and begin to pray

Let the numbness begin to fade
Then I'll stand on my own again
Let the wind pick away the silence
Brave and sworn won't hold me from flying

Free to be loved, now
Sun shines but the Lord has helped me
Subconsciously I prepare
Courage and faith will guide me
As the layers begin to shed

Let my mind break away the burdens
As my new life begins to bloom
Consciously I surrender
Ready to face the truth

That has shown my dependency
Limitations will set me free
My desires and my beliefs
Patiently await for me

I can hear as they sing to me
Natures calling my destiny
Telling me no more suffering
Peace of hours will set you free

In this world sometimes feel chained and confined
So fuck the pigs, stay away from dangerous swine
Mass media's there for entertaining the blind
News only shows violence and pain and some crime
More you see something, more it's ingrained in your mind
But if you look deep beyond the matrix you'll find
There's a pattern to everything, look at nature's design
From the complex down to the most basic's entwined
And then you meet someone and your fate is aligned
Go seek the answers, find the craziest signs
Look inside yourself see what's innate and divine
Your reality is simply just the state of your mind
It can bring your happiness, can create your decline
You can get where you want just use patience and time
It doesn't take much to be grateful and kind
Change starts with you, hope you ascertaining the rhymes

Looking at the world, and these times is so hard
I'm fighting my battles and living with my scars
Keep falling back down as I reach for the stars
But one day (A change gon' come)
Stay getting high so I don't feel so low
And it hurts me so much, right deep in my soul
But if it's one thing I know is I still gotta grow
Cause one day (A change gon' come)

Wasted some time being a crook in the streets
Wasn't tryna get locked by the crooked police
That's why I'm going hard with my books and my beats
It's up to me, I'm the one changing my path
Negative to positive, rearranging the math
But it's never easy, change can be painful and sad
No it's not enough just to be angry and mad
You gotta be the change you been hoping to see
Wanted someone to do something, well the closest was me
Learned the ways of Buddha like I was smoking some trees
Knowledge helped my mind become open and free
Corporations run the world, millions to blow
But member we the ones who been giving them dough
Bringing militant flow, in civilian clothes
Can't last forever, look what the visions foretold

Yeah
And I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe
And my waves they by riding but they in a tiny boat
This my shit I'm taking over it's my time and they should know
They ain't shit they can try but they can't stop me once I go
And I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe
And my waves they by riding but they in a tiny boat
This my shit I'm taking over it's my time and they should know
They ain't shit they can try but they can't stop me once I go

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Ain't nobody really understand it
All the feelings I keep in can't stand it
Yeah I write about it but that don't give me the answers
Got me feeling desperate all I do is panic
Feel locked up and I can't find the key
I swear I'm playing hide and seek
With my self my mind is lost I'm stressed out way beyond belief
I need some help
That is a fact
This goes way beyond this rap
If ain't have it honestly you probably find me on my back
Hugging my self
Cold to the touch
I would be dead
Ain't nothing else
Just being honest not only to you but especially more so to myself

And now I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe
And my waves they by riding but they in a tiny boat
This my shit I'm taking over it's my time and they should know

And I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe
And my waves they by riding but they in a tiny boat

They ain't shit they can try but they can't stop me once I go

[Verse 2]
Man this past year was a crazy road
Was in high school but making plenty dough
Cashing cheques bigger than I've ever seen
I was young dumb now I'm close to broke
Making money young's a scary thing
Teach you lessons you ain't ever think
Looking back at all the shit I bought
It'd probably be smarter if I kept it safe
But I've learn from it
I've grown from it
The road I see has no summit
I'ma keep climbing
I'ma keep finding
New ways to move so I won't plummet
I'ma be the greatest ever
Ain't nothing gonna slow me
Fuck around and take my shot and watch me cash out like I'm Kobe
Fuck all my demons
Although I need them
They can be hard
I know they teachin' me
I've been learning
Deep down it's worth it
I am the only one who can defeat them
Thats a promise I'll never fall
For the bullshit fakes that he tryna call
Tryna find their way in I'ma kill 'em all
You know what hold up I'ma let 'em talk
[Chorus]
And I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe
And my waves they by riding but they in a tiny boat
This my shit I'm taking over it's my time and they should know
They ain't shit they can try but they can't stop me once I go
And I pick out my targets like its eeny miny moe

Yo, yo Soup Boys
Queens shit (Queens shit)
(Soup Soup Soup Soup) Alright

[Verse 1: Heems]
Indians jersey and an Om on my necklace
Outside Van Buren, I’m parked in a Lexus
Waiting for the man, I’m waiting for a gram
I’m waiting for the man to put a gram up in my hand
And I’m looking fresh, you’ll never find a flyer steeze
I’m in Richmond Hill smoking with the Guyanese
Hindus getting higher than a motherfucking fire kid
Punjabis wild, yo, Himanshu is a Shayar, man
They’re throwing stones at the Mosque
I'm in tune with goons that's stoned at the Mosque
I’m throwing stones in the zone with my vox
You eating stones, I’m seeing drones up top

[Hook: Heems]
That drone cool but I hate that drone
Chocolate chip cookie dough in a sugar cone
Drones in the morning, drones in the night
I’m trying to find a pretty drone to take home tonight
[Verse 2: Heems]
Timberlands on, polo rugby on my back
I’m outside John Bowne, I’m parked in an Ac
I’m waiting for Jay, Jay got the yay
And when I see Jay, all my problems go away
Now I'm drinking with my cousin bars we bum rushing
Drinking White Russians with Russians in Flushing
We can tussle if they look at my cousin’s girl
You couldn’t last a day in Tarun's world
Moving in Carlos, Corona, taper
If they talk about us, they about to get shanked up
I wake up I'm listening for them to say Hindu
But no problem, then I do like Him do
I’m stoned, I’m stoned at my parent’s house
White boys throwing stones at my parent’s house
They dot-busting, hate crime, race war
I'm high as space dog, wild as three caged boars

[Hook: Heems]
That drone cool but I hate that drone
Chocolate chip cookie dough in a sugar cone
Drones in the morning, drones in the night
I’m trying to find a pretty drone to take home tonight

[Verse 3: Heems]
I’m rocking Nikes, Timeport Motorola
In front of Cardozo, Toyota Corolla
Puff holder, Coca Cola, Back-seat scroller
Back street stroller, hash-tree roller
Chole bhatura eater, heater holder
He the chosen heathen, he hone in and hold her
For Ransom, my Temple look like a mansion
Hindu centre, we be praying we be dancing
On the boulevard, right on Kissena
We rolling green up, from Mecca to Medina
They throwing stones at the temple
Got me drinking too much, got me going mental
Like that drone modest, but that drone flaunt
All of them drones do what them drones want
Drones want to fire then drones want to kill
Drones want your dome and your bone and your grill

That drone cool but I hate that drone
Chocolate chip cookie dough in a sugar cone
Drones in the morning, drones in the night
I’m trying to find a pretty drone to take home tonight

Oh, what's a devil to do
When those old delusions so tried and true
Don't come through like they used to?

Ugh, all my money's run out
I blew it all on a cumulus cloud
That dissipated so fast, seems the good times never last
And I always fall flat on my back, like an upside-down cat

But is bad luck really such a crime?
If you won't be my valentine, could you at least give me a little bit of sympathy?

(Um, uh, oh... just like... You know what, like, never mind... Um...)

Oh, I made a silly mistake (what'd you do?)
I've given up more than I can take (uh oh!)
And left hollows in my wake
(I'm safe, I'm whole, I've got it under control)
My structure's compromised
(I'm safe, I'm whole, I've got it under control)
But you still batter at all my fault lines
(And I will protect you even if you won't protect me too)
I can't run, I can't hide, but you can't say I didn't try

To retreat back into me like a catabolic seed
I want to destroy everything that's mine
If you won't be my valentine, could you at least give me a little bit of sympathy?

Cause in any state I f**king grind
Clock ticking, New York minute, it's about that time
Cause when I go I'm about this dough can't let this G-G-G-GO
""GO GO""

[VERSE 1]
Had a choice music or get that car ..
I got a voice you didn't think I was going to get that far
From the playground to the backyard
Concrete jungle where they go so hard
Nobody knew that there was that God
Young little fella that was going so hard
Ain't no way you can tilt my frame
Especially dog when I built my lane
Recite my rhymes, can't steal my brain
Hard-knock life but I still maintain
""dang dang dang""
I was always told this kid is gone pop
Up all night until the sh*t get right
If the fam ain't good then that sh*t don't stop
Remember the day when I told my bro
I'ma get his dream and never let go
""go get it""
You already know the team wit it
That's what he said and I'll never forget it
""hit it""
Boom i'ma light this stage
Pave the way as I write this page
Got to get a mill, no eat, no sleep
I'ma die a legend when they write my grave
Live how you think and think how you live
Zero f*cks is the thanks I'ma give
Later on I'ma have to pay that bid
But a smart young man never burns his bridge
Climb that ladder as I reach success
Reppin for God as they read my chest
They want my soul as I take each breath
Take each step to find the best of me
Hop on a flight to my destiny
No blue print but here's the recipe
For you ? I'll leave the rest of me
The rest of me until the death of me
Don't know where to start ?
""look sh*t up""
No made drinks
""we shook sh*t up""
No bread here
""we cooked sh*t up""
Dropped a verse
""and I hooked sh*t up""

Basically, I built my way
It's clear to say I was built this way
Had no heart cause I had no pops
They never knew that I felt that way
To get it ? Depends how you really really want it
Strong survive so we out here gunning
10.4 better run that 100
Cause now-a-days everybody be frontin
It's like they charging to tell the truth
Reach for the sky, then watch the roof
Rip the booth, record the proof, these guys in suits just delete the truth
""Ow""
Let me watch my mouth
Soap it up before they wash mines out
Move my mom before they watch my house
And be glad to say that I'm not myself
""Noo""
You loved who I am why change up now ?
Deep thought I'm considered profound
Run my town
Every last breath
Ball real hard to relieve my stress
Keep shut I don't want no tech
I'm not talking no gun, ain't talking no vest
Prepare for the worst and hope for the best
""Eazieee""
To make them believe they need me
We all got a struggle you see me
Hold my hand don't deceive me
Throw me in the booth then leave me
Kill a couple beats don't grieve me
Keep the faith and say your grace
And I'll feed you if they feed me
""Uh uh whew""
Got to thank mama for seeing this Earth
Pay homage for the ones that worked
Sorry Lord for the ones I hurt
Forgive me now before you lay my dirt

Send ""Pray Let It Snow"" Ringtone to your Cell
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the tv
It's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

And I know there's sunshine behind that rain
And I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and I pray (Let it snow)
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin' (Let it snow)
So let it snow... (Let it snow)

I Pray... it's another Christmas holiday
When the schildren sing
Let the angels bring any present that they need
We got a thing can't let it slip away
Now outside it's raining so I pray
I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and pray (Let it snow)
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin' (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and...

Pray For the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the ones not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray. Can you give 'em one today

I just can't sleep tonight (tonight)
Someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)

Look at us
Two Sugar Land kids looking all grown up
The same ones that were too young to stay in love
But here we are, so good so far
Hey, baby, look at us
Sleeping on a mattress on the floor
When we got what we got, we don't need nothing more
What a life, what a love, look at us

From ""Hey, can I get your number?""
To ""Whatcha doing Friday night?""
Straight through a teenage summer
To going on our fifth July
From porch lights and swingin' on swings
To real life doin' its thing

Looking for the ways to make me laugh

To trying on rings

From the close calls and almost walking out the door
To running so fast, straight back to the thing worth fighting for

It all started with a ""Hey, can I get your number?""
To ""Whatcha doing Friday night?""

Looking for the sun
Will we ever see it shine
In the days to come

We are children lost from life
Lost forever more
Destined to be lonely swans
On a lonely shore

Friends of old to you we sing
A song to close the day
Slumber now in peaceful dreams
As it fades away

Slowly now the darkness falls
On the earth so still
Like a bird it spreads its wings
Over valley, lake and hill

Shadows deep crawl ovеr the land
Swallowing light and song
Yet we can't lеave this windy shore
Bound by chains so strong
Distant fleeting echoes of yore
Of when the dawn was bright
Twilight breaks light granite on ice
We are children born in night

A song to close the day
Slumber now in peaceful dreams
As it fades away

Found another way
What I’m doing this my other way

Now, usually people rep the city their from
But screw that! (Why?)
Mines is shitty as fuck!
Only slutty bitties most ain't got no titties to suck
And most the homie's staying busy getting dizzy from rum
I'm rapping izzy at the end of every wizzy because
It ain't hard to be the shizzy when the competizzy is dumb
I stay rizzy I'm the shizzy and you shitty and uh
I can still say izzy quickly spit it sickly you fucks

[Hahaha]

I was just playing around in the first verse
I just wanted put it down, cause my nerves hurt
Had to get it off my chest now, Heard the birds chirp
When I tried to write my rhymes down, I reversed words
I hear rappers now, theres absurd herds
Of faggots whose only sound is cursewords
So now I'm back and bound, to observe works
And the only thing that I have found, was absurd turds
So I decided its time I take a seat on my thrown
So I can leave these whack rappers obsolete and unknown
Half of hip-hop lost their way so I'm leading em home
Tuck em into bed and then I'll proceed to control
All of hip hop so GuTii will be in the zone
Continue killing tracks cuz my destiny it unfolds
When I'm on the mic hip-hop will cease to be blown
I'll resurrect it from deceased and retrieve all the bones

Lately I haven't been myself
I cussed a girl out on accident and slapped her with a belt
She went from being abstinent to tragic with no self
Its sad as shit its happening that what its about
The compassion man I'm lacking it but that's the hand that's dealt
I'll slap a bitch then grab her tits then smack her in the mouth
I'll relax a bit and gag the bitch until she passes out
I'm inhabiting this rapping shit I'm back n on the prowl
I'm immaculate extravagant an advocate and loud
I'm a savage and a masochist but I attract them crowds
I'm a catalyst attacking quick the baddest shits in town
The antagonist you laugh at this its hazardous to health

Lately I don't know what to spew on a track
For some reason I dispute my own views on a rap
Its like I can't produce what I used to in fact
I'm so used to the abuse I had at youth that I've snapped
I can't compute and not letting loose isn't hap... enning
Cause I'ma doodle all these brutal attacks
Cause its futile and its crucial the removal of whack
So in the booth i'll keep it truthful and quadruple my stacks
Its been awhile since i had a track with a hook
But there's no need for me to take it back to the books
I don't need no catchy chorus in my rap does it look
Like I give two shits about that? WHAT THE FUCK!

I do what i wanna do and don't take tips from you bitches
Cause honestly even my only competition is trippin'
They heard the tracks I been droppin' and started switchin' their written's
But their rhymes are as cute as kittens smitten with mittens
I spit it twisted and prolific for these kids and they listen
There's no decision the precision of my written's is hittin'
The nerves of every christian whose missions religion
They say I'm going to hell lets hope their vision comes to fruition
The physicians say that my conditions been in remission
Now that I've been so vicious a new conditions arisen
I'ma musician imprisoned within these walls and restrictions
No submission I'm not quitting till I fall in bed twitching

But modestly and honestly
I gotta be an oddity
Bitches couldn't silence me if the gave me a lobotomy
The quality and quantity of my raps an anomaly
I'm the prophecy of Socrates
You stoppin' me? Impossibly!
These wannabes commonly and constantly wanna see
If they could rhyme with me its a comedy so they sloppily
Copy me or mock at me I mop up these cocky teens
An oddity A prodigy, bitch I'ma commodity!
So yeah, I'ma end the track on that note
You can see my rapping's so cold you'll be snatchin' a coat
And yeah bitch, GuTii, is back in the zone
I'ma let the beat play out now while I go relax in the throne!

Let the rest of the industry come and do what their supposed to be doing

Over attachments, so attractive like sold gadgets
Enscribin upon a stone tablet, off fo tabs of potent acid

If you fix what isnt, it will break
Me and my lady sitting on our broken mattress
So broke, our bank accounts are the same forwards as they are backwards

If theres a will then theres a way
To see the way you must stay still
Killing craniums, building pay up in the bay
Playing pillage n abduct, stealing stank like weight up in the ville

Often what we need to
Whеn i say we, i mean you
You dont need to believe truth, its sees you

When it come time for confession, im stressing

Anymonous ghost writing with the spirits called lost
Found the stairway up to heaven, but the gate was still locked
Left the digits in my heart, and started to call god

Show up or show down, show us or bow down
You think im vile, but...
Yall sucking my nuts so much, you could throw up my child

A man of my word, i, won't, step in your shit
Like im standing on turds, im doing this on my terms
One hand on a bird, better than two in the bush
I put one in her tush and two in her puss-

1917,"Wouldn't it be nice...

If people only got pregnant when they wanted to?
To have it all under control
Then there wouldn't really be a need for abortion
Well, welcome to the REAL works and things look a lot different

No-one should have the right to dictate to woman
What she should do with her body
Or for the rest of her fucking life

Do you think by illegalising abortions
That abortions are going to stop?
(just take a look back and you'll know the answer)
We need free state abortions that are safe and hygienic
(without apology)
Not a return to unsafe
And fatal backstreet abortions",pop

If a nigga disrespect me I swear to god I'ma up the heat

Took the weight off my mama back and put it on mines

These niggas gone hate me cause I’m really up next

Never coming back
No, not anymore
I will never be cuffed
A prisoner of my mind, never break again
Had my time to rest
Passed it nonetheless

You'll find a red baloon
Find a red baloon

When the roses bloom

Underneath this inept prison of civilization
Only a memory of the cold river glide around us, wind pushing the trees, speaking to our true thirst
The blood of those who deny our return to purity
Burning in contempt of our holy enslavement

Perpetuating endless dissonance, and destroying the seed of moral pestilence
Inhaling the dull smoke, carried over the blackened earth, our blood revolts, against this disgrace of humanity

Embers of the spiritual mass grave of religion, glowing in our eyes
At first sun, truly alone in our breath and beating chests, we dig into our forgotten past
Screaming into the cold emptiness

Round each other but not round a third one

If this universe increased to its extremity
When the other side transists into a black hole
A downward spiral of the corporeal masses
Our existence is complete in both directions

And emotions only feeling pretty angry just
Imitating and making jokes to blend cause it feels
Right the anxiety is less and less friendly its
Why i made killson stressed out from feeling
Like i was the reason behind parents relationship
To come to an end
Lets not pretend i don't descend into a
Personality complex outside my own i
Descended into self hatred and loving the
Feeling of being alone i wanted to just let
Things go because my mother and father
Stressed me out to the point where i related
With al pacinos and charles scorceses in movies
Wanted something bigger thanks to disney
Harbored my imagination from black cauldron
To gold chests of lucky charms only thing i saw
Coming my way growing was sex and death and
I wasn't wrong i got to do all i wished for now its

The lines on the script say that I'm okay (Tha-tha-that I'm okay)

Deaf to the crowd that I claim to know
Standing in an ocean

All these waves drag me down
And I feel like I gotta go
I'm a castaway

My face is wearing thin
These thoughts, they chafe against my skin
Lost in the crowd again
And I swear I met this guy who seemed like a friend
Wow, look how far I've fallen (Fallen)
Now, everything's dark
And I don't wanna fall again
I'm a castaway

Resurrected from their tombs
Hands and swords rising up

Merciless bites! With no regrets

Marching over rotten bodies
Eating flesh, drinking blood
Marching over burial ground
Bloody killing all around

There's no escape from the legion of the resurrected!

I hope you get what I'm trying to say
My words in the shape of somebody else's rhyme
But messages sent aren't always received
The code is too hard or the signal gets weak
Mine's easy it just says ""I love you"" twenty times
[Chorus]
But you don't even know that I've been running
Completely unaware that I'm coming after you
And you can tell your friends that you feel nothing
Tell them that I do too, oh

[Chorus]
But you don't even know that I've been running
Completely unaware that I'm coming after you
And you can tell yourself that you feel nothing
But I know you...
Don't even know that I've been running
Completely unaware I'm coming after you
And you can tell yourself that you don't feel a thing
But I know you do
'Cause I've seen you move
Whenever I'm near you",rock

We’re standing here all alone in your driveway
The red sun slipping down and it's getting late
I try to turn and walk away
I don’t want to go I don’t want to go

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s an ocean in your eyes
And I’m waiting for the tide to break
There’s a world full of lies
And I’m trying to make the right mistake
My hands start shaking, I can’t take it anymore
Your heart is breaking, but you still close the door

[Chorus]
You are the beat
To my soul
And I am, well I am yours
You’re my gravity
The push and the pull
I don’t want to go
I don’t want to go
I don’t want to go
I don’t want to go
I don’t want to go
I don’t want to go

Maybe what's best was there in the first place
I want to turn back is it too late?
You’re already gone you’re already gone

There’s an ocean in your eyes
And I’m waiting for the tide to break
There’s a world full of lies

Do you think that they have though?

Picture perfect
She gets to work
And lifts her skirt
To sit near a sick pervert
That spits when he talks
But the prick's her boss
And that's why she doesn't get pissed off
That he gawked when she passed by
'Cause if she shows panty-hose
And exposes herself clotheless
And goes with the flow
Then the quality tits and A
Will probably get her raise
Gobblin' dick for days, great!
Whatever gets the pay
But what happens when she loses her assets?
Stops usin' her ab-flex
And her boobs and her ass gets
All loose and elastic
He finds that she's past her prime
And that she can't rely
Just on her ass to climb
Up the corporate ladder
She been travelling up
Since she was sixteen
Drunk and sick in the clubs
With the same fuckin' prick
That's her boss today
They graduated from the clubs
Into an Office Space

Walkin' through the revolvin' doors
Me, I'm still down here
Moppin' these hallway floors
He's graduated from the Lexus to a Benz
To a lay-by coupe
And a better group of friends
A better medical plan
A higher tax-bracket
Hired a black butler
With a tie & black jacket
He's in his office late night with the lights on
Interviewing pretty in turns with the blinds drawn
He's even signed-on as good as he used to fuck
Way back in the day when they used to cruise the clubs
Booze & drugs used to get her on her knees quick
She'd sniff coke
Take it from diseased dick
But she quit went and got a degree
Six years of school later now she's back on her knees again
And he can't get the smile off his face
Late night layin' pipe in his office space

Good God, this house
Get me away

Only trying to stand up from the ground
Fear - is taking a hold on me
Bring me to my suppressed and locked up dreams

Stand up - I mut convince that I'm not insane
That this world on the other side is real
Pain - I iwll tolerate and not give up
When my challenge is over I am God

He has been poisoned with nothing but lies
And one day it may be too late

Break the silence
Wake from the illusion
That you will be greater than God
Find the reason of life
Or else you may find the way
That will lead you to nothing but death

I'm king - you will see that I am not insane
I will prove to the world, one day you'll see

Never did learn his name;
His eyes were bright coloured
But not both the same

He shook my hand warmly
I could tell he was strong
And he answered my questions

Same everywhere;
One make it, two take it
Mostly don't care

Well, it rained all that night
And in the morning, rain still
And i saw the traveller
At the top of the hill
He was laughing at the thunder
And banging a gong
And, at the top of his voice
He shouted his song
One find it, etc

When the storm had died down
He came to my door
And he looked really happy
As he dripped on the floor
He said, ""please excuse me
But i won't stay long;
Just give me what you don't want
And then i'll move on, singing

One find it, etc

He refused with a glare
Then he roared out with laughter

6200,"Throughout the past 18 months Surge have had hidden cameras
placed in dairy farms around the UK. What we have documented, has shocked us.

The dairy industry is painted as a wholesome industry where the animals are treated with care and compassion. Grazing dairy cows and adverts perpetuating these ideas reinforce the notion that animals don't suffer for dairy products. However the footage that we have acquired tells a very different story to the one the industry tells us. Animals being systematically exploited and abused, farmers showing contempt towards the animals, violently beating them and showing a complete disregard for their life.

What you're about to see is objective, it is the reality and it is the truth. Cows are mammals, which means they only produce milk to feed their children. Consequently, dairy cows are forcibly impregnated every year to ensure they're continuously producing milk that the farmer can sell for profits.

This is done by a farmer or a vet, restraining the cow and forcing his arm inside the anus of the cow, holding her cervix through the lining of the anus and enforcing a syringe through the cow's vagina and injecting bull semen inside her cervix.

When the cow gives birth, her baby is taken away from her almost immediately. Mother cows form close relationships with their children with natural herds being both matriarchal and familial. Consequently, the separation of the calves from their mother causes them both huge amounts of suffering and distress. We documented farmers dragging, kicking and throwing newborn calves. On this farm, the calves are tossed into the front loader of a tractor, unable to stand, their mothers desperately trying to help.

On dairy farms, calves are separated from their mothers and have no opportunity to feel maternal love or even to feed naturally. On this farm, the calves are instead pinned down and force-fed formula by the farmer. Calves that don't willingly accept the force-feeding are slapped and thrown around like they are worthless. They are only babies. This farmer is tagging the ear of this calf who has only just been born. The separated calf calls out to their mother.

Male calves are of no use to dairy industry. So every year in the UK, around 90,000 male dairy cows are shot and discarded soon after birth. Simply because they are not deemed profitable enough by the farmers. The other males will either be sold on and raised for beef or they'll be killed for veal. The female calves are normally placed in solitary confinement pens where they can legally be kept for up to eight weeks.

The mother cows are then milked by being herded into the milking parlors. This can happen up to three times a day. Cows who do not willingly walk to be milked are beaten, punched, and abused until they comply with the farmers.

This abuse was documented at every dairy farm that we visited. Death can be found everywhere on dairy farms. With dairy calves left to rot on the ground. Mother cows who are seen as no longer being useful to the farmer are also often shot on the farm, sometimes being left to decompose. Swearing, shouting and verbal abuse was also documented as being commonplace across the dairy farms that we investigated. Cows are sensitive animals who form close bonds and are easily scared.

What we see in this footage does not represent isolated cases or bad apples. This footage represents the systematic and ubiquitous nature of the violence that takes place on animal farms. Even those actions that are legally condoned still cause suffering. Dairy products come from violence, but we have the power to make it stop.
Please leave dairy off your plate.
Together we can make the violence end.
Thank you for watching.",misc

2168,"The Wedded Wife

The upshot of it all was that Alvina ran away to Scarborough without telling anybody. It was in the first week in October. She asked for a week-end, to make some arrangements for her marriage. The marriage was presumably with Dr. Mitchell—though she had given him no definite word. However, her month's notice was up, so she was legally free. And therefore she packed a rather large bag with all her ordinary things, and set off in her everyday dress, leaving the nursing paraphernalia behind.

She knew Scarborough quite well: and quite quickly found rooms which she had occupied before, in a boarding-house where she had stayed with Miss Frost long ago. Having recovered from her journey, she went out on to the cliffs on the north side. It was evening, and the sea was before her. What was she to do?

She had run away from both men—from Ciccio as well as from Mitchell. She had spent the last fortnight more or less avoiding the pair of them. Now she had a moment to herself. She was even free from Mrs. Tuke, who in her own way was more exacting than the men. Mrs. Tuke had a baby daughter, and was getting well. Ciccio was living with the Tukes. Tommy had taken a fancy to him, and had half engaged him as a sort of personal attendant: the sort of thing Tommy would do, not having paid his butcher's bills.

So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation. She was sick of being badgered about. She didn't really want to marry anybody. Why should she? She was thankful beyond measure to be by herself. How sick she was of other people and their importunities! What was she to do? She decided to offer herself again, in a little while, for war service—in a new town this time. Meanwhile she wanted to be by herself.

She made excursions, she walked on the moors, in the brief but lovely days of early October. For three days it was all so sweet and lovely—perfect liberty, pure, almost paradisal.

The fourth day it rained: simply rained all day long, and was cold, dismal, disheartening beyond words. There she sat, stranded in the dismalness, and knew no way out. She went to bed at nine o'clock, having decided in a jerk to go to London and find work in the war-hospitals at once: not to leave off until she had found it.

But in the night she dreamed that Alexander, her first fiancé, was with her on the quay of some harbour, and was reproaching her bitterly, even reviling her, for having come too late, so that they had missed their ship. They were there to catch the boat—and she, for dilatoriness, was an hour late, and she could see the broad stern of the steamer not far off. Just an hour late. She showed Alexander her watch—exactly ten o'clock, instead of nine. And he was more angry than ever, because her watch was slow. He pointed to the harbour clock—it was ten minutes past ten.

When she woke up she was thinking of Alexander. It was such a long time since she had thought of him. She wondered if he had a right to be angry with her.

The day was still grey, with sweepy rain-clouds on the sea—gruesome, objectionable. It was a prolongation of yesterday. Well, despair was no good, and being miserable was no good either. She got no satisfaction out of either mood. The only thing to do was to act: seize hold of life and wring its neck.

She took the time-table that hung in the hall: the time-table, that magic carpet of today. When in doubt, move. This was the maxim. Move. Where to?
Another click of a resolution. She would wire to Ciccio and meet him—where? York—Leeds—Halifax—? She looked up the places in the time-table, and decided on Leeds. She wrote out a telegram, that she would be at Leeds that evening. Would he get it in time? Chance it.

She hurried off and sent the telegram. Then she took a little luggage, told the people of her house she would be back next day, and set off. She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster. But no matter.

She waited a long time for the train from the north to come in. The first person she saw was Tommy. He waved to her and jumped from the moving train.

""I say!"" he said. ""So glad to see you! Ciccio is with me. Effie insisted on my coming to see you.""

There was Ciccio climbing down with the bag. A sort of servant! This was too much for her.

""So you came with your valet?"" she said, as Ciccio stood with the bag.

""Not a bit,"" said Tommy, laying his hand on the other man's shoulder. ""We're the best of friends. I don't carry bags because my heart is rather groggy. I say, nurse, excuse me, but I like you better in uniform. Black doesn't suit you. You don't mind—""

""Yes, I do. But I've only got black clothes, except uniforms.""

""Well look here now—! You're not going on anywhere tonight, are you?""

""It is too late.""

""Well now, let's turn into the hotel and have a talk. I'm acting under Effie's orders, as you may gather—""

At the hotel Tommy gave her a letter from his wife: to the tune of—don't marry this Italian, you'll put yourself in a wretched hole, and one wants to avoid getting into holes. I know—concluded Effie, on a sinister note.

Tommy sang another tune. Ciccio was a lovely chap, a rare chap, a treat. He, Tommy, could quite understand any woman's wanting to marry him—didn't agree a bit with Effie. But marriage, you know, was so final. And then with this war on: you never knew how things might turn out: a foreigner and all that. And then—you won't mind what I say—? We won't talk about class and that rot. If the man's good enough, he's good enough by himself. But is he your intellectual equal, nurse? After all, it's a big point. You don't want to marry a man you can't talk to. Ciccio's a treat to be with, because he's so natural. But it isn't a mental treat—
Alvina thought of Mrs. Tuke, who complained that Tommy talked music and pseudo-philosophy by the hour when he was wound up. She saw Effie's long, outstretched arm of repudiation and weariness.

""Of course!""—another of Mrs. Tuke's exclamations. ""Why not be atavistic if you can be, and follow at a man's heel just because he's a man. Be like barbarous women, a slave.""

During all this, Ciccio stayed out of the room, as bidden. It was not till Alvina sat before her mirror that he opened her door softly, and entered.

""I come in,"" he said, and he closed the door.

Alvina remained with her hair-brush suspended, watching him. He came to her, smiling softly, to take her in his arms. But she put the chair between them.

""Why did you bring Mr. Tuke?"" she said.

He lifted his shoulders.

""I haven't brought him,"" he said, watching her.

""Why did you show him the telegram?""

""It was Mrs. Tuke took it.""

""Why did you give it her?""

""It was she who gave it me, in her room. She kept it in her room till I came and took it.""

""All right,"" said Alvina. ""Go back to the Tukes."" And she began again to brush her hair.
Ciccio watched her with narrowing eyes.

""What you mean?"" he said. ""I shan't go, Allaye. You come with me.""

""Ha!"" she sniffed scornfully. ""I shall go where I like.""

But slowly he shook his head.

""You'll come, Allaye,"" he said. ""You come with me, with Ciccio.""

She shuddered at the soft, plaintive entreaty.

""How can I go with you? How can I depend on you at all?""

Again he shook his head. His eyes had a curious yellow fire, beseeching, plaintive, with a demon quality of yearning compulsion.

""Yes, you come with me, Allaye. You come with me, to Italy. You don't go to that other man. He is too old, not healthy. You come with me to Italy. Why do you send a telegram?""

Alvina sat down and covered her face, trembling.

""I can't! I can't! I can't!"" she moaned. ""I can't do it.""

""Yes, you come with me. I have money. You come with me, to my place in the mountains, to my uncle's house. Fine house, you like it. Come with me, Allaye.""

She could not look at him.

""Why do you want me?"" she said.

""Why I want you?"" He gave a curious laugh, almost of ridicule. ""I don't know that. You ask me another, eh?""

She was silent, sitting looking downwards.

""I can't, I think,"" she said abstractedly, looking up at him.

He smiled, a fine, subtle smile, like a demon's, but inexpressibly gentle. He made her shiver as if she was mesmerized. And he was reaching forward to her as a snake reaches, nor could she recoil.

""You come, Allaye,"" he said softly, with his foreign intonation. ""You come. You come to Italy with me. Yes?"" He put his hand on her, and she started as if she had been struck. But his hands, with the soft, powerful clasp, only closed her faster.

""Yes?"" he said. ""Yes? All right, eh? All right!""—he had a strange mesmeric power over her, as if he possessed the sensual secrets, and she was to be subjected.

""I can't,"" she moaned, trying to struggle. But she was powerless.

Dark and insidious he was: he had no regard for her. How could a man's movements be so soft and gentle, and yet so inhumanly regardless! He had no regard for her. Why didn't she revolt? Why couldn't she? She was as if bewitched. She couldn't fight against her bewitchment. Why? Because he seemed to her beautiful, so beautiful. And this left her numb, submissive. Why must she see him beautiful? Why was she will-less? She felt herself like one of the old sacred prostitutes: a sacred prostitute.

In the morning, very early, they left for Scarborough, leaving a letter for the sleeping Tommy. In Scarborough they went to the registrar's office: they could be married in a fortnight's time. And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell. Only she knew it. She felt extinguished. Ciccio talked to her: but only ordinary things. There was no wonderful intimacy of speech, such as she had always imagined, and always craved for. No. He loved her—but it was in a dark, mesmeric way, which did not let her be herself. His love did not stimulate her or excite her. It extinguished her. She had to be the quiescent, obscure woman: she felt as if she were veiled. Her thoughts were dim, in the dim back regions of consciousness—yet, somewhere, she almost exulted. Atavism! Mrs. Tuke's word would play in her mind. Was it atavism, this sinking into extinction under the spell of Ciccio? Was it atavism, this strange, sleep-like submission to his being? Perhaps it was. Perhaps it was. But it was also heavy and sweet and rich. Somewhere, she was content. Somewhere even she was vastly proud of the dark veiled eternal loneliness she felt, under his shadow.

And so it had to be. She shuddered when she touched him, because he was so beautiful, and she was so submitted. She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow. Yet her mind remained distantly clear. She would criticize him, find fault with him, the things he did. But ultimately she could find no fault with him. She had lost the power. She didn't care. She had lost the power to care about his faults. Strange, sweet, poisonous indifference! She was drugged. And she knew it. Would she ever wake out of her dark, warm coma? She shuddered, and hoped not. Mrs. Tuke would say atavism. Atavism! The word recurred curiously.

But under all her questionings she felt well; a nonchalance deep as sleep, a passivity and indifference so dark and sweet she felt it must be evil. Evil! She was evil. And yet she had no power to be otherwise. They were legally married. And she was glad. She was relieved by knowing she could not escape. She was Mrs. Marasca. What was the good of trying to be Miss Houghton any longer? Marasca, the bitter cherry. Some dark poison fruit she had eaten. How glad she was she had eaten it! How beautiful he was! And no one saw it but herself. For her it was so potent it made her tremble when she noticed him. His beauty, his dark shadow. Ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage. He seemed to emerge. Before, he had seemed to make himself invisible in the streets, in England, altogether. But now something unfolded in him, he was a potent, glamorous presence, people turned to watch him. There was a certain dark, leopard-like pride in the air about him, something that the English people watched.

He wanted to go to Italy. And now it was his will which counted. Alvina, as his wife, must submit. He took her to London the day after the marriage. He wanted to get away to Italy. He did not like being in England, a foreigner, amid the beginnings of the spy craze.

In London they stayed at his cousin's house. His cousin kept a restaurant in Battersea, and was a flourishing London Italian, a real London product with all the good English virtues of cleanliness and honesty added to an Italian shrewdness. His name was Giuseppe Califano, and he was pale, and he had four children of whom he was very proud. He received Alvina with an affable respect, as if she were an asset in the family, but as if he were a little uneasy and disapproving. She had come down, in marrying Ciccio. She had lost caste. He rather seemed to exult over her degradation. For he was a northernized Italian, he had accepted English standards. His children were English brats. He almost patronized Alvina.

But then a long, slow look from her remote blue eyes brought him up sharp, and he envied Ciccio suddenly, he was almost in love with her himself. She disturbed him. She disturbed him in his new English aplomb of a London restaurateur, and she disturbed in him the old Italian dark soul, to which he was renegade. He tried treating her as an English lady. But the slow, remote look in her eyes made this fall flat. He had to be Italian.

And he was jealous of Ciccio. In Ciccio's face was a lurking smile, and round his fine nose there seemed a subtle, semi-defiant triumph. After all, he had triumphed over his well-to-do, Anglicized cousin. With a stealthy, leopard-like pride Ciccio went through the streets of London in those wild early days of war. He was the one victor, arching stealthily over the vanquished north.

Alvina saw nothing of all these complexities. For the time being, she was all dark and potent. Things were curious to her. It was curious to be in Battersea, in this English-Italian household, where the children spoke English more readily than Italian. It was strange to be high over the restaurant, to see the trees of the park, to hear the clang of trams. It was strange to walk out and come to the river. It was strange to feel the seethe of war and dread in the air. But she did not question. She seemed steeped in the passional influence of the man, as in some narcotic. She even forgot Mrs. Tuke's atavism. Vague and unquestioning she went through the days, she accompanied Ciccio into town, she went with him to make purchases, or she sat by his side in the music hall, or she stayed in her room and sewed, or she sat at meals with the Califanos, a vague brightness on her face. And Mrs. Califano was very nice to her, very gentle, though with a suspicion of malicious triumph, mockery, beneath her gentleness. Still, she was nice and womanly, hovering as she was between her English emancipation and her Italian subordination. She half pitied Alvina, and was more than half jealous of her.

Alvina was aware of nothing—only of the presence of Ciccio. It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her. She lived within his aura. And she submitted to him as if he had extended his dark nature over her. She knew nothing about him. She lived mindlessly within his presence, quivering within his influence, as if his blood beat in her. She knew she was subjected. One tiny corner of her knew, and watched.

He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty. His eyes glowed with lustrous secrecy, like the eyes of some victorious, happy wild creature seen remote under a bush. And he was very good to her. His tenderness made her quiver into a swoon of complete self-forgetfulness, as if the flood-gates of her depths opened. The depth of his warm, mindless, enveloping love was immeasurable. She felt she could sink forever into his warm, pulsating embrace.

Afterwards, later on, when she was inclined to criticize him, she would remember the moment when she saw his face at the Italian Consulate in London. There were many people at the Consulate, clamouring for passports—a wild and ill-regulated crowd. They had waited their turn and got inside—Ciccio was not good at pushing his way. And inside a courteous tall old man with a white beard had lifted the flap for Alvina to go inside the office and sit down to fill in the form. She thanked the old man, who bowed as if he had a reputation to keep up.

Ciccio followed, and it was he who had to sit down and fill up the form, because she did not understand the Italian questions. She stood at his side, watching the excited, laughing, noisy, east-end Italians at the desk. The whole place had a certain free-and-easy confusion, a human, unofficial, muddling liveliness which was not quite like England, even though it was in the middle of London.

""What was your mother's name?"" Ciccio was asking her. She turned to him. He sat with the pen perched flourishingly at the end of his fingers, suspended in the serious and artistic business of filling in a form. And his face had a dark luminousness, like a dark transparence which was shut and has now expanded. She quivered, as if it was more than she could bear. For his face was open like a flower right to the depths of his soul, a dark, lovely translucency, vulnerable to the deep quick of his soul. The lovely, rich darkness of his southern nature, so different from her own, exposing itself now in its passional vulnerability, made her go white with a kind of fear. For an instant, her face seemed drawn and old as she looked down at him, answering his questions. Then her eyes became sightless with tears, she stooped as if to look at his writing, and quickly kissed his fingers that held the pen, there in the midst of the crowded, vulgar Consulate.

He stayed suspended, again looking up at her with the bright, unfolded eyes of a wild creature which plays and is not seen. A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face. What did he see when he looked at her? She did not know, she did not know. And she would never know. For an instant, she swore inside herself that God Himself should not take her away from this man. She would commit herself to him through every eternity. And then the vagueness came over her again, she turned aside, photographically seeing the crowd in the Consulate, but really unconscious. His movement as he rose seemed to move her in her sleep, she turned to him at once.

It was early in November before they could leave for Italy, and her dim, lustrous state lasted all the time. She found herself at Charing Cross in the early morning, in all the bustle of catching the Continental train. Giuseppe was there, and Gemma his wife, and two of the children, besides three other Italian friends of Ciccio. They all crowded up the platform. Giuseppe had insisted that Ciccio should take second-class tickets. They were very early. Alvina and Ciccio were installed in a second-class compartment, with all their packages, Ciccio was pale, yellowish under his tawny skin, and nervous. He stood excitedly on the platform talking in Italian—or rather, in his own dialect—whilst Alvina sat quite still in her corner. Sometimes one of the women or one of the children came to say a few words to her, or Giuseppe hurried to her with illustrated papers. They treated her as if she were some sort of invalid or angel, now she was leaving. But most of their attention they gave to Ciccio, talking at him rapidly all at once, whilst he answered, and glanced in this way and that, under his fine lashes, and smiled his old, nervous, meaningless smile. He was curiously upset.

Time came to shut the doors. The women and children kissed Alvina, saying:

""You'll be all right, eh? Going to Italy—!"" And then profound and meaningful nods, which she could not interpret, but which were fraught surely with good-fellowship.

Then they all kissed Ciccio. The men took him in their arms and kissed him on either cheek, the children lifted their faces in eager anticipation of the double kiss. Strange, how eager they were for this embrace—how they all kept taking Ciccio's hand, one after the other, whilst he smiled constrainedly and nervously.",misc

Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should've said in time
I just never took the time

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best
Then I'm so sorry I was blind

[Chorus]
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
[Bridge]
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
To keep you satisfied

Wipe your smile away and then
Take your hope away again and again and again and again

Lose me in the middle of nightmare screams
Oceans full of apathy
Bash my head against the wall again and again and again

Tie you up and drive us off the farthest south-side pier

Where the fuck has Fredo been bro, he’s never gonna be shit
Stay you, he said he was gonna drop that in 6th grade bro
It’s been three years Fredo’s never gonna be anything

Where were you when we needed you most
You never live up to what you talk about
Stay you is never dropping
Nostalgic was just the beginning
We need you Fredo, where were you

[Verse 1: Flackofredo]
Look nigga, I've been this way
Since them niggas loaded up them shotgun shells
And shot my older cousin *bleep* all in his face
Fuck niggas talkin', my teachers called me a disgrace
Can't  wait to pull up on 'em in a big Wraith
I sold work on sick days and ripped Jays
I spent days tryna duck the ricochets
'Cause we was tryna figure which clique played with the shooter
Nowadays y'all boys just tryna figure who click play
I made bitches and made niggas, y'all boys just bitch made niggas
I flip it like a switch, swiss-blade, nigga
Fuck around with me, come run the town with me
I do it for my dogs and niggas that's down with me
He spent around 50 tryna look like us, tryna flex with some bottles
But let's address it proper
I mean, I find it funny they give me the same bundle without spendin' money
They just give it to me, 'cause I'm poppin'
More honesty and less lies
She driving me crazy I ain’t no Mothafuckin test drive
I took the jet for the fuckin' 110th time
Hoping that I don't go out like Aaliyah or a Left Eye
Shit, I'm the greatest, I'm the people's favorite
Thanks to God's graces, I'll be number one in all these peoples' faces
So amazing how I made it from the mazes and the phrases change faces
But I'm back to being basic
How many years am I gon' spend being famous? Acting like I'm normal
Like I don't realise I made it, like I don't realise I'm famous
Like I don't realise everytime I walk around the city
They look at me like the greatest
All-time hated nigga, put me in your playlist
Trunk on the front of McLaren's that need a waitlist
So when I back, back, I'm frontin' on fuck niggas
That told me I'll never made it, in my Audemar Piguet wrist
I hop the plane in sweats and the bathing ape kicks
50 pointer bracelets, man's best fragrance
I'm still ballin', these foul niggas is still flagrant
I ain't got no business talkin' just to build statement
See the life from a faraway
I still feel close on the nights when I'm far away
I'm comin' home, workin' at nights to a hard day
Tryin' to avoid nights in the hallway selling hard ye
Back when you was hip-hoppin' and watchin' Kanye
I was coach hoppin' and sleepin' inside a Hyundai
Made bands out of any floor, at your mom's place
Tryna duck the crime rate, where the fuck was my mindstate?
[Verse 2: Flackofredo]
I cry real tears thinkin' 'bout my best friend’s face
If she was here, I'm thinkin', what would my best friend say?
She'd say, I'm well accomplished, she'd say I really did it
She said don't let her settle for no penny pincher
I, will not lose, no, I refuse
I, 2 plus 2 niggas, I school niggas
She wanna get high, fuck with a cool nigga
48 floors, check out my view nigga
Uh, I already know the outcome
I know I fucked it up with sirenity right before this album
My ex on me like Malcolm, she know we can't be together
But still be asking me how come? I know the shit crazy
My life upgraded and I ain't going backwards
Closest thing to going backwards is me rollin' Backwoods
Looking at you niggas like there's no more factors
Until the story over like there's no more chapters
It’s Fredo

Off a runway to the manufactured night
In storybooks you’ll never find
In paper armor that you’d mind
They’ll hold the match to you this time
And watch the smoke rings fit the crime

In moments you cannot reprise
Like a soldier or a watch that you can’t wind
We fought the world with hands twice-tied
The people cheered, the captain cried
I’ll keep the souvenir inside

And I wouldn’t lie
I never really wanted more
Than what I ever really needed after all

You made a promise then you hide
And you said we’d all be dead by twenty-five
It’s not your disappointed sigh
It’s not you traded this for pride
Not that we really even mind

And you turn to go
Bolt the door
And you tell me to get out
I'll sit in my car with the radio on
Singing along with ian curtis
She's lost control again

Ain't that the curse of the second hand?
Ain't that the ticking off of the hours in our days?

If i weren't so afraid and alone
I swear I'd make them pay me what i am worth
But it would not be enough
When I know you deserve better
So you strap up yеr black book

And you do it so well
You say you lovе it
Say you hate it

No it ain't

If you'd only open up
Your blood stained eyes
To everything you say insane
Man it's just sad and true
I guess the truth it ain't enough
What will ever be enough?

Strap up yer black book

Nod over coffee
As you turn to stone
Sit in traffic
And watch time die
Curse the sun while you beg it for rain
Ain't that the curse of the second hand?
Ain't that the ticking off of the hours in our days?

The sea will boil before y'all understand
I built this ship of fools with my own hands
I drowned in the water then i slaughtered the lamb
To get away from your homemade wasteland
Found self help in charles fort's book of the damned
You can't drink His blood then ask for white wine instead
If I am insane then why are you still listening?

I'm scared of hell and I'm scared of heaven too

This is my story and this is my song
I've been begging for forgiveness for far too long
Were you there when they crucified
The idea of the divine
How great thou art is when the critics decide
If this is a union then my soul's paying the dues
That feed the yankee fools on the sitcom nightly news
Why try to understand when my words aren't understood
When melody is heresy and irony is truth?

[Verse 1]
Bitch it's Mastercard, but I don't use MasterCard
Take some credit cards, then we drive off in our car
Treat em' like Pokémon Cards, you won't get them back
I don't use the dark web, I'm bad at the Internet
My grandma down stairs singing, but I'll still rap
I bet my grandma sings better than you can
If you fuck with someone you should support them
Don't just show love in the DMs
If you can't stand up for someone then you aren't really friends
MCB gave me my first ever beat
[Verse 2]
30 fucking songs all in one week
I got three mixtapes and five EPs'
I can do six songs in one day
I can finish a mixtape by Friday
I got a mixtape coming out on Friday
I don't do a lot of features, but I'd do a feature
If you wanna rap you gotta get out the bleachers
Talking to my nigga Esteban, he told me he hates his teacher
Told him make some money, that's the only way you'll teach her

Nothing was the same since the afternoon
Cause it's 10:32 and I'm after you
And you've been playing hard to get, I kinda like it too
So drop it low for the boy, cause I'm watching you

[Verse 1: Genom]
Late nights, argue bout the dumbest things
When all I wanna do is put a diamond chain
On your neck, watch you smile
Ask you can you stay a while
Make me feel some type of way
Want you here right next to me
But you ain't down for me
Cause even though it's hard to see
I can tell you've been hurt, so I'm tryna put in work
So that you can come and get a new start with me
But you don't even show you love it
Got me on a string like a puppet
Sometimes you try and act rugged
But you just want a man by your heart like a locket
[Interlude: Genom]
So come my way, girl let's have some fun today
I'm just tryna talk to you, we can even start with hey
10:32 and I'm buzzing, got you fussing
Like its nothing, I ain't fronting
You the finest, no discussion

Oh, ain't seen no sunlight at all
Cigarettes are my love light

I'm spending those moments with you
And the ground I am walking, the air that I breathe
Are shared at those moments with you

You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you

In the songs I've been singing, quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of a song would come true

You love for real, you show the feel
Of everything that touches you

You are of gracefulness, you are of happiness
You are what I would guess to be most like
What I've been singing of
Love, love, love, love
In the songs I've been singing, quite often a phrase
Comes close to the feeling of you
But I never suspected that one of those days
The wish of a song would come true

Charging hard and no one's going to give in

Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back

I ain't really here to be your mommy
Think twice before you hit me with them sorrys
Checked the mirror this morning
And I ain't no Atari
Say they love me now
Wanna fuck me now
I just think that it's funny how
You think I would ever let you love me down
With that ugly mouth
I would rather eat puppy chow

Save it now

Tryna hold my family down
While you running round
In and out of town
If you ain't get the message now
Please, let me dumb it down
You, ain't really fuck with me
And it really stuck with me
And I mean this constructively
Instead of instructing me
Please productively
Get the fuck out my face

Yeah the lame type
Yeah the switch on a bro
Just to lay pipe
Change up your mood
By the day type

All I needed was a ting to accelerate
Get from A to B so I could a sell a K

I see feds and I won’t hesitate to, Bloooow-I

Know these roads like the back of my hand so I’m gone, it’s nice to know ya

While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow
I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, ""Thank you""

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Don't go away,

Come back

Help me to believe in you!
What on earth am I to do?

She's gone,
this vision who was not quite real.
I must move on,
despite the pain. The pain will heal.
Oh, Lord!
How could you let me love like this?
No one dies upon a kiss,
and only fools believe in bliss.

And yes! God knows, I am a fool,
A man deluded by his wife,
a figure ripe for ridicule,
who's lived a vain and useless life.
So be it then! I'll play that game!
I do not give a tinker's dam!
I'll be a fool - it's all the same.
It truly doesn't matter what I am!
God, no!
I'm broken, but I'm still alive!
And slowly I will feel my soul revive.
With time I'll find a way to right this wrong,
if it takes my whole life long.

I’m wilding out no nick cannon but meet the cannon you try me

Soulful stories got me thinking I’m legendary just for the moment

We move through time with this music and sometimes it get lonely

I wanna was take off

Sign jet life

Get my family straight

Thou shall not rest until I make my whole fam rich

I’m on a different wave and they can’t see me but they prey they could

That music touch my soul and I can’t control what’s gone happen

Let’s get it popping like bones at the chiropractor

For the simple fact of the matter my homies gone no laughter


Winter cold shoulders

It’s oh so bogus but I manuver

Straight through matrix

My conversations

Make life switch up

Like Q and bishop ..


I got the juice but it’s dirty
You know my background


Play crazy with my ice cold feelings and you hear Mack sounds at the end of the day

And by the end of the race
And they’ll consider me great


I want my son to know the difference between rich and wealthy
May god help me
And on this path no weapons formed shall prosper
He Ben a problem and sick with it no need for doctors


The shot caller


Indigo child turnt mobster

Steak over shrimp with a bed of the best pasta


Minding mine with lines I swear it’s nice this time

No longer feel the competition they look up to me ..

In Hell’s Kitchen it’s bone chilling
But still I stand

As the chapter is passed  I just snap that disposing
Held captive to cap shivs and motives
Well over that passion that had you emotive
One card is flashed and its hereafter? Unfolding
Some start to clash losing track they’re promoting
The dust hits us each differently
With substancе, if instant release hits instantly
Sick sеizing simply sickly for simile
A striptease fingertips greasing like if even

Genius forever escaping as we keep reaching
For whatever duration, if there's indeed meaning

Seeming steamy over what ellipses should be streaming

As ecstasy is to keep peaking

Every ghost gonna shriek till they find their machinE
Til they boot up at a station or decide to be seen
Every letter chimes or resides in they dreams
Set into the shrines that describe what they mean
The benefits defined by the time that they've screened
Or deemed of  any use by the mind of a being
We just appetites wet and dried by agreeing
Just getting bites then prescribed while receiving
While they find a replacement as you leaving
Or they try that one inclination you've been fleeing
For a time
For the flash keep it beating
Always following or leading
Follow up for treatment
Like there's throttle when it's decent
Up in a bottle getting caught up in a deep end
Like Solomon just scheming
Tolerant esteeming
My idols just idle
Just hollowing and weeping
Wrinkled collar with its crease in
My idols just idols I'm hollering
Want a lifestyle
A completion
An arms race just to charge your convictions
Pick a stardate just to start the ignition
For abuse to follow it needs victim

Or am I gunning for the running of dimension
Taking up space
Shaking up things
Waking up faced
With the facts or a fixing",rap

A hidden cigarette that actually helps you breathe

You think the government, it wants you on your knees

Which one of you niggas have crossed that line
So I could bury it deep with box that pow-
These niggas talking like it’s only rap shit
Till I come attack with you was only practice
Run up on you hatchet shot your body on fire
Give me a couple matchsticks
I’m a sick type nigga with this venom
I send em up with the quick stride niggas
Only retching the carnage it’s up in this side nigga
Bout to rape my opponents
Couldn’t talk to provoke me ya’ll I’m equipped with the fuckery
Now I’m laying em down won’t stop bucking stock G’s
Suffer quick from them rounds you niggas are wannabes
Man at that you wanna be spitting sick like you wanna be
But you ain’t got the sound
This is safe to say that I’ll chuck your head with the apes
I’m just a nigga all bad so I’m going straight for face
It’s crowded here at the bottom then I’m making some space
Two pills the seroquel and a bag at pawn therapist told me I’m crazy I’m always past my dose
Losing sight of reality the catastrophe’s on peer point precision
I’m leaving cavity’s smoking
It’s left so much of a body and let the gravity hold it nigga

Since I was sinning and shitting up in the cell
Scramble in citizens when I’m spitting and it’s in the shell
Send us the sheepy secret not sick on me quick to twelve days

Shoot two right through you when I gun
And I put the work in
Every time I get a little pissed and brain sick the flow
Then a motherfucker die go back and check for certain
Hit the nine drinkers plus stains from my coat
Clacking them in the back that’s that daily
Swing loaded with the axe hit em with the MAC then behead thee slacks until max kill em with a knife like I’m Freddy

Ready or not here I come hit em with a dump dump

Sippin' in classrooms, trippin', I would get what I gave, hey
Huh, too busy buyin' liquor to pay attention to grades
Side-chick callin', I was stuck in the ways for a quick nut
No business actin' that way, had to change
My mindset, not a mantra, sing
Spread love, once you sow, more than often, you reap
Heads up in these streets, don't look down, you a king
How you gonna be seen?
It's how you treatin' the people that's supportin' your dreams
Just give it all to yo' mama, yo' Dad, yo' girl and yo' team
And just ignore all the people that's not supplyin' good vibes
Some people really don't belong in yo' life
But that don't mean you gotta not treat 'em right
Straight love is the wave you should ride
Alright, wait
[Chorus: Dende]
Ride the wave, you should ride the wave (Uh)
Save the hate for another time, another place
Spread some love each and everyday (Uh)
What you give, you reciprocate
Wait, ride the wave, you should ride the wave (Uh)
Save the hate for another time, another place
Spread some love each and everyday, ayy (Uh)
What you give, you reciprocate, wait",rb

Leonard: There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.

Howard: But does it have peanut oil?

Leonard: Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.

Sheldon: Since it’s not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.

Raj: Are there any chopsticks?

Sheldon: You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Leonard: Here we go.

Sheldon: Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.

Leonard: Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on the door.) I’ll get it.

Howard: Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
(Leonard opens door to Penny, steps into hallway)

Penny: Hey Leonard.

Leonard: Oh, hi Penny.

Penny: Am I interrupting.

Leonard: No.

Sheldon (off): You’re not swelling, Howard.

Howard (off): No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna sausages.

Penny: Sounds like you have company.

Leonard: They’re not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in hallway.) So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How was work.

Penny: Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.

Leonard: So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.

Penny: Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was….

Leonard: Yes.
Penny: Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so…. (apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel…hello!

Howard: (speaks a phrase in Russian).

Penny: I’m sorry?

Howard: Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

Penny: No, I haven’t.

Howard: Get used to it.

Penny: Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon.

Sheldon: Hi.

Penny: Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to me, huh?

Sheldon: Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t talk to women.

Howard: He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!

Leonard: So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?

Penny: Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.
Leonard: Yeah, no problem.

Penny: Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you.

Leonard: Penny, wait.

Penny: Yeah?

Leonard: Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?

Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?

Sheldon: You’re kidding, right?

Penny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?

Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together: One. (Raj raises one finger).

Sheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

Penny: Yes, I know, men can’t fly.

Sheldon: Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.

Leonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.

Sheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.

Leonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.

Sheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.

Howard: Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.

Sheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.

Penny: I’m just going to go wash up.

Leonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.

Sheldon: Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We’re locked out.

Raj: Also, the pretty girl left.

[Credit sequence.]

[Scene: Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.]

Leonard: Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.

Sheldon: I hardly think so.

Leonard: Why not?

Sheldon: Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.

Leonard: We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter… (starts to move package) I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have this.

Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.

Leonard: Do you have any ideas?

Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.

[Time shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package onto the bottom of the stairs.]

Leonard: Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.

Sheldon: Exactly half.

Leonard (snarkily): Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is easy, all in the math.

Sheldon: What’s your formula for the corner.

Leonard: What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.

(Sheldon heads up the stairs. The package slides back down to the bottom.)

Sheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.

[Time shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway, not their own.]

Sheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?

Leonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.

Sheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.

Leonard: I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there’s no way it could lower the odds.

Quick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the top of the staircase.

Leonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)

Sheldon: No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not.

[Scene: Inside Penny’s apartment. They are laying the package down on the floor.]

Sheldon: Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!

Leonard: You okay?

Sheldon: No, it hurt… (looking around) Great Caesar’s Ghost, look at this place?

Leonard: So Penny’s a little messy.

Sheldon: A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.

Leonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?

Sheldon: No.

Leonard: Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.

Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.

Leonard: Come on, we should go.

Sheldon: Hang on.

Leonard: What are you doing?

Sheldon: Straightening up.

Leonard: Sheldon, this is not your home.

Sheldon: This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.

Leonard: When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he kept the place.

Sheldon: Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.

Leonard: What were you doing in his closet?

Sheldon: I helped run some cable for a webcam.

Penny (entering): Hey guys.

Leonard: Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.

Penny: Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?

Sheldon: (sucks in breath)

Leonard: No.

Sheldon: No?

Leonard: No.

Sheldon: No.

Leonard: Well, we’ll get out of your hair.

Penny: Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).

Sheldon: Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to live like this. I’m here for you.

Penny: What’s he talking about?

Leonard: It’s a joke.

Penny: I don’t get it.

Leonard: Yeah, he didn’t tell it right.

[Scene: Leonard’s bedroom, he is asleep. Sound of door opening and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.]

Leonard: Sheldon?

[Scene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.]

Leonard: Sheldon? Hello?

(Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)

[Scene: Penny’s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.]

Leonard: Sheldon!

Sheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.

Leonard: Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean.

Sheldon: I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this.

Leonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?

Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.

Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.

Leonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

(Penny snores)

Sheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.

Leonard: What?

Sheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.

Leonard: That’s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)

Sheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that’s ridiculous.

Leonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go.

Sheldon: I am not leaving until I’m done.

Leonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).

Sheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.

Leonard: Oh, what the hell.

[Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself.]

Sheldon: Morning.

Leonard: Morning.

Sheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.

Leonard: I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.

Sheldon: Sarcasm?

Leonard: You think?

Sheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny’s quality of life.

Leonard: You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

Sheldon: You don’t think that crosses a line?

Leonard: Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.

Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?

Leonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

Sheldon: Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.

Penny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!

Leonard: Penny’s up.

Penny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!

Leonard: How did she know it was us?

Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.

Penny (voice off): Leonard!

Leonard: God, this is going to be bad.

Sheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.

Penny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?

Leonard: Yes, but, only to clean.

Sheldon: Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty, per se.

Penny: Give me back my key.

Leonard: I’m very, very sorry.

Penny: Do you understand how creepy this is.

Leonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.

Penny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.

Sheldon: And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor.

Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?

Sheldon: Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”) Oh!

Penny: God!

Leonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.

Penny: Stay away from me.

Leonard: Sure, that’s another way to go.

Sheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.

Leonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What’s funny?

Sheldon: That wasn’t sarcasm?

Leonard: No.

Sheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny’s door.) I have a masters and two PhD’s, I should not have to do this.

Penny (opening door): What?

Sheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.

[Scene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.]

Penny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?

Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she’s standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?

Penny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?

Raj (internally): She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.

Penny: It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out.

Raj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)

Penny: I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?

Raj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.)

Penny: That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You’re a doll. (She hugs him.)

Raj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)

[Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game.]

Howard (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served.

Leonard: It’s fine. You win.

Howard: What’s his problem?

Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.

Howard: Been there.

Raj (entering): Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

Howard: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?

Raj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.

Leonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

Raj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and… then she hugged me.

Howard: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?

Raj: intoxicating, isn’t it?

[Scene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny’s door. It opens.]

Penny: Hi.

Leonard: Oh.

Penny: What’s going on?

Leonard: Um, here’s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….

Penny: Leonard.

Leonard: Yeah.

Penny (hugs him): We’re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)

[Scene: Penny’s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.]

Leonard: Six two inch dowels.

Sheldon: Check.

Leonard: One package, Phillips head screws.

Sheldon: Check.

Penny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.

Leonard: No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do considering.

Sheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?

Howard (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.

Leonard: What?

Howard: These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.

Penny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.

Leonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.

Sheldon: We could put her stereo back there.

Leonard: And control it how?

Sheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.

Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you gonna cool it?

Penny: Hey guys, I got this.

Sheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?

Leonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.

Howard: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC…

Penny: Guys, this is actually really simple.

Howard: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

Leonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?

Sheldon: And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.

Penny: Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all my clothes.

Leonard: Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.

Sheldon: Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink.

Howard: Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.

Leonard: Meet back here in an hour?

Howard: Done.

Leonard: Got it. (They all leave).

Penny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.",misc

Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
That them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that

Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line

When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey

When they had passed the bachelors' room the sergeant who accompanied Nekhludoff left him, promising to come for him before the inspection would take place. As soon as the sergeant was gone a prisoner, quickly stepping with his bare feet and holding up the chains, came close up to Nekhludoff, enveloping him in the strong, acid smell of perspiration, and said in a mysterious whisper:

“Help the lad, sir; he's got into an awful mess. Been drinking. To-day he's given his name as Karmanoff at the inspection. Take his part, sir. We dare not, or they'll kill us,” and looking uneasily round he turned away.

This is what had happened. The criminal Kalmanoff had persuaded a young fellow who resembled him in appearance and was sentenced to exile to change names with him and go to the mines instead of him, while he only went to exile. Nekhludoff knew all this. Some convict had told him about this exchange the week before. He nodded as a sign that he understood and would do what was in his power, and continued his way without looking round.

Nekhludoff knew this convict, and was surprised by his action. When in Ekaterinburg the convict had asked Nekhludoff to get a permission for his wife to follow him. The convict was a man of medium size and of the most ordinary peasant type, about thirty years old. He was condemned to hard labour for an attempt to murder and rob. His name was Makar Devkin. His crime was a very curious one. In the account he gave of it to Nekhludoff, he said it was not his but his devil's doing. He said that a traveller had come to his father's house and hired his sledge to drive him to a village thirty miles off for two roubles. Makar's father told him to drive the stranger. Makar harnessed the horse, dressed, and sat down to drink tea with the stranger. The stranger related at the tea-table that he was going to be married and had five hundred roubles, which he had earned in Moscow, with him. When he had heard this, Makar went out into the yard and put an axe into the sledge under the straw. “And I did not myself know why I was taking the axe,” he said. “'Take the axe,' says he, and I took it. We got in and started. We drove along all right; I even forgot about the axe. Well, we were getting near the village; only about four miles more to go. The way from the cross-road to the high road was up hill, and I got out. I walked behind the sledge and he whispers to me, 'What are you thinking about? When you get to the top of the hill you will meet people along the highway, and then there will be the village. He will carry the money away. If you mean to do it, now's the time.' I stooped over the sledge as if to arrange the straw, and the axe seemed to jump into my hand of itself. The man turned round. 'What are you doing?' I lifted the axe and tried to knock him down, but he was quick, jumped out, and took hold of my hands. 'What are you doing, you villain?' He threw me down into the snow, and I did not even struggle, but gave in at once. He bound my arms with his girdle, and threw me into the sledge, and took me straight to the police station. I was imprisoned and tried. The commune gave me a good character, said that I was a good man, and that nothing wrong had been noticed about me. The masters for whom I worked also spoke well of me, but we had no money to engage a lawyer, and so I was condemned to four years' hard labour.”

It was this man who, wishing to save a fellow-villager, knowing that he was risking his life thereby, told Nekhludoff the prisoner's secret, for doing which (if found out) he should certainly be throttled.",misc

Boy, the fun we have

It all passes

Our gutter shootouts in the street

Wild minded engineer
Designed children’s amusement rides
Diamond pythons, hurricanes
And monster rainbow slippery slides

Lightning, strikes first, then comes, thunder
Swim in, reverse, shark eyes, perverts

Some want the genius to crawl in a parade
To talk and impress and reveal all their tricks
To give them the future without the destruction
Of passionate poison and learning to listen

Randell just wanted to hang with his brother
To tell him some stories, but he’s just a sucker
That lives in his books and gets lost with his characters
One day he’ll get through this pitiful laughter

Everybody feels real til they're laying dead on the floor
I've seen it before
I'm so easily bored
You should be checking out the women
What you preeing me for?
If you don't wanna meet your maker better settle your damn jaw
Smoke a lot of weed but I'm going to Dam for more
Maybe a sativa that'll settle my anger or
Light my head space
So I can elevate and get away from your dead face
And dead waste
Wannabee hard nuts and gangstas
I'm sick of these wankers
Knock me out or drop me out
Stab me, shoot it out
Or shut your mouth
Dunno what your talking about
You got a problem? Sort it out
Count 10 and just walk it out
Kill any ideas that you thought about
You don't wanna see your soul go walkabouts
Body on the floor chalk it out
Close your spout
Please put a stop to that noise that you're squawking out
And have a breather
Go disrupt another geezer
Time is money and I'm tight like Ebenezer
I just wanna chill for real where all the trees are
Kill yourself it'll be easier

Had no remorse recourse was a boy until I ran into the source of the voice,

You have sometimes felt my teardrops on your hand
And when we can't control our lonely feelings
We love each other now and then

We're a little less than lovers but a little more than friends
Clinging to each other until the darkness ends
We have held each other time and time again
And loved each other every now and then

Some day I'll find the one who's meant for me
And I that some day you'll find love again
But we'll always have the very special memories
Of the love we gave each other now and then

There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay

That you love them take your money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart
But it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go",pop
6690,"[Verse 1: Shepard]
I apologize for giving y’all
The wrong impression
It’s Muzi on the beat
Killing it till the end
My life is a game
Lemme call it Ping-Pong
It’s like flipping a coin
Its either heads or tails
And I'm feeling ding-dong
Ain’t studying for the test
But I'm passing anyway
We used to be a team
Living on the same land
Lemme call it dream land
And I'm talking about you
My pretty little vine
And my problems multiplying
Like shadow clone Jutsu
Lindani ntwana yam'
Unga lahli ethemba boy
Ngi yaz impilo ezema
Kodwa ngizo hlala ngi khona
Looking on your face
And feeling that pain
[Chorus X2]
Sorry, I'm Sorry
I'm Sorry, Sorry
Sorry
[Verse 2: Pyro T]
Apologies are accepted
But the way you hurt me got me agitated
You gave me hatred
You the girl that got me hated
By the majority
You say you sorry
I’m sorry
Before I fought for us even though I knew it was wrong
But now I rather be right
I rather lose my childhood
Than faking it all, being good
You couldn't understand me
Am a poem without a flow
You gotta listen to the words to get me
That’s when you'll feel me
You know what's funny
Is that I had harmony
Until you took my flow
And you threw mine out the door
You relieved my pain
But now you miss cocaine
I had to keep calm, stay sane
I felt the truth, enjoyed the freedom
As my spirit enjoyed his kingdom
I hope y'all get me
As i had to speak my emotions poetically
[Chorus X2]

[Verse 3: Creature]
I know i broke a promise, I'm Sorry
I know i let you down when
All I could have did was uplift
At least you gave me the chance
To let your happiness increase
But all i did was retreat, the pain couldn’t stop
And the medicine was finished
But Listen, to my reasons
My actions were foolish, or should i say stupid
And i really care about you girl and i mean it
The future i have seen it
In my dreams and in my visions
As i paint these pictures i see colors of perfection
Planets and galaxies
Your eyes are the reflection
And your mind is the creation
You might think it’s ironic
I know i broke a promise
Let me it blame it on the Chronic

[Chorus X2]",rap
