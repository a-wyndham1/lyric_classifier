And Reality is so far away
Dreamscapes floating by, I’m longing for your tenderness
Maybe I will find you someday

And I want rather die at once
Than live without you
You give me shelter from the pain

And I want rather fall asleep
Than wake up without you
You are the way out of this cruel game

Deep inside my soul emptiness is filling me
And thousand questions haunt my consciousness
Seasons floating by and I know I am close to you
But I can never feel your caress",pop

Sliced guts, carved flesh
Dressed in blood, as I stab out thine eyes
Burning ants, so obedient
Twisting and turning
As I take their poor lives
Awaiting the kiss of bliss
Yet never such splendor

Where they bleed me a river of ever sweet blood
All shall perish
I’ll devour you and claim your strength
All shall perish
Bleed me a river of ever flowing blood
I am
A silent god with no love nor compassion
I am
The beginning of unrestrained horrors
Blood lust!
Primal hunter
Empty eyes my only witness
As the insides, come pouring out
Genitals ripped off, lungs put on a plate
Aroused by divinity
I butcher them, like cattle at a slaughter house
Devour their remnants to gain godlike strength
All shall perish
I’ll devour you and claim your strength
All shall perish
Bleed me a river of ever flowing blood
I am
A silent god with no love nor compassion
I am
The beginning of unrestrained horrors
A silent God
Feeds upon flesh of the feeble-minded and the weak
All shall perish
Roaming above the ants to see the world burn

A silent God
Crowned in terror (choir: he is forever crowned in terror)
The beginning of the end
A silent God
Crowned in terror
All shall perish
I’ll devour you to claim your strength

The One-Boy Insurgency

IN THE PREDAWN DARKNESS OF AUGUST 26, 1929, IN THE back bedroom of a small house in Torrance, California, a twelve-year-old boy sat up in bed, listening. There was a sound coming from outside, growing ever louder. It was a huge, heavy rush, suggesting immensity, a great parting of air. It was coming from directly above the house. The boy swung his legs off his bed, raced down the stairs, slapped open the back door, and loped onto the grass. The yard was otherworldly, smothered in unnatural darkness, shivering with sound. The boy stood on the lawn beside his older brother, head thrown back, spellbound.

    The sky had disappeared. An object that he could see only in silhouette, reaching across a massive arc of space, was suspended low in the air over the house. It was longer than two and a half football fields and as tall as a city. It was putting out the stars.

    What he saw was the German dirigible Graf Zeppelin. At nearly 800 feet long and 110 feet high, it was the largest flying machine ever crafted. More luxurious than the finest airplane, gliding effortlessly over huge distances, built on a scale that left spectators gasping, it was, in the summer of ‘29, the wonder of the world.

    The airship was three days from completing a sensational feat of aeronautics, circumnavigation of the globe. The journey had begun on August 7, when the Zeppelin had slipped its tethers in Lakehurst, New Jersey, lifted up with a long, slow sigh, and headed for Manhattan. On Fifth Avenue that summer, demolition was soon to begin on the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, clearing the way for a skyscraper of unprecedented proportions, the Empire State Building. At Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx, players were debuting numbered uniforms: Lou Gehrig wore No. 4; Babe Ruth, about to hit his five hundredth home run, wore No. 3. On Wall Street, stock prices were racing toward an all-time high.

    After a slow glide around the Statue of Liberty, the Zeppelin banked north, then turned out over the Atlantic. In time, land came below again: France, Switzerland, Germany. The ship passed over Nuremberg, where fringe politician Adolf Hitler, whose Nazi Party had been trounced in the 1928 elections, had just delivered a speech touting selective infanticide. Then it flew east of Frankfurt, where a Jewish woman named Edith Frank was caring for her newborn, a girl named Anne. Sailing northeast, the Zeppelin crossed over Russia. Siberian villagers, so isolated that they’d never even seen a train, fell to their knees at the sight of it.

    On August 19, as some four million Japanese waved handkerchiefs and shouted “Banzai!” the Zeppelin circled Tokyo and sank onto a landing field. Four days later, as the German and Japanese anthems played, the ship rose into the grasp of a typhoon that whisked it over the Pacific at breathtaking speed, toward America. Passengers gazing from the windows saw only the ship’s shadow, following it along the clouds “like a huge shark swimming alongside.” When the clouds parted, the passengers glimpsed giant creatures, turning in the sea, that looked like monsters.

    On August 25, the Zeppelin reached San Francisco. After being cheered down the California coast, it slid through sunset, into darkness and silence, and across midnight. As slow as the drifting wind, it passed over Torrance, where its only audience was a scattering of drowsy souls, among them the boy in his pajamas behind the house on Gramercy Avenue.

    Standing under the airship, his feet bare in the grass, he was transfixed. It was, he would say, “fearfully beautiful.” He could feel the rumble of the craft’s engines tilling the air but couldn’t make out the silver skin, the sweeping ribs, the finned tail. He could see only the blackness of the space it inhabited. It was not a great presence but a great absence, a geometric ocean of darkness that seemed to swallow heaven itself.

The boy’s name was Louis Silvie Zamperini. The son of Italian immigrants, he had come into the world in Olean, New York, on January 26, 1917, eleven and a half pounds of baby under black hair as coarse as barbed wire. His father, Anthony, had been living on his own since age fourteen, first as a coal miner and boxer, then as a construction worker. His mother, Louise, was a petite, playful beauty, sixteen at marriage and eighteen when Louie was born. In their apartment, where only Italian was spoken, Louise and Anthony called their boy Toots.
    From the moment he could walk, Louie couldn’t bear to be corralled. His siblings would recall him careening about, hurdling flora, fauna, and furniture. The instant Louise thumped him into a chair and told him to be still, he vanished. If she didn’t have her squirming boy clutched in her hands, she usually had no idea where he was.

    In 1919, when two-year-old Louie was down with pneumonia, he climbed out his bedroom window, descended one story, and went on a naked tear down the street with a policeman chasing him and a crowd watching in amazement. Soon after, on a pediatrician’s advice, Louise and Anthony decided to move their children to the warmer climes of California. Sometime after their train pulled out of Grand Central Station, Louie bolted, ran the length of the train, and leapt from the caboose. Standing with his frantic mother as the train rolled backward in search of the lost boy, Louie’s older brother, Pete, spotted Louie strolling up the track in perfect serenity. Swept up in his mother’s arms, Louie smiled. “I knew you’d come back,” he said in Italian.

    In California, Anthony landed a job as a railway electrician and bought a half-acre field on the edge of Torrance, population 1,800. He and Louise hammered up a one-room shack with no running water, an outhouse behind, and a roof that leaked so badly that they had to keep buckets on the beds. With only hook latches for locks, Louise took to sitting by the front door on an apple box with a rolling pin in her hand, ready to brain any prowlers who might threaten her children.

    There, and at the Gramercy Avenue house where they settled a year later, Louise kept prowlers out, but couldn’t keep Louie in hand. Contesting a footrace across a busy highway, he just missed getting broadsided by a jalopy. At five, he started smoking, picking up discarded cigarette butts while walking to kindergarten. He began drinking one night when he was eight; he hid under the dinner table, snatched glasses of wine, drank them all dry, staggered outside, and fell into a rosebush.

    On one day, Louise discovered that Louie had impaled his leg on a bamboo beam; on another, she had to ask a neighbor to sew Louie’s severed toe back on. When Louie came home drenched in oil after scaling an oil rig, diving into a sump well, and nearly drowning, it took a gallon of turpentine and a lot of scrubbing before Anthony recognized his son again.

    Thrilled by the crashing of boundaries, Louie was untamable. As he grew into his uncommonly clever mind, mere feats of daring were no longer satisfying. In Torrance, a one-boy insurgency was born.

If it was edible, Louie stole it. He skulked down alleys, a roll of lock-picking wire in his pocket. Housewives who stepped from their kitchens would return to find that their suppers had disappeared. Residents looking out their back windows might catch a glimpse of a long-legged boy dashing down the alley, a whole cake balanced on his hands. When a local family left Louie off their dinner-party guest list, he broke into their house, bribed their Great Dane with a bone, and cleaned out their icebox. At another party, he absconded with an entire keg of beer. When he discovered that the cooling tables at Meinzer’s Bakery stood within an arm’s length of the back door, he began picking the lock, snatching pies, eating until he was full, and reserving the rest as ammunition for ambushes. When rival thieves took up the racket, he suspended the stealing until the culprits were caught and the bakery owners dropped their guard. Then he ordered his friends to rob Meinzer’s again.

    It is a testament to the content of Louie’s childhood that his stories about it usually ended with “… and then I ran like mad.” He was often chased by people he had robbed, and at least two people threatened to shoot him. To minimize the evidence found on him when the police habitually came his way, he set up loot-stashing sites around town, including a three-seater cave that he dug in a nearby forest. Under the Torrance High bleachers, Pete once found a stolen wine jug that Louie had hidden there. It was teeming with inebriated ants.

    In the lobby of the Torrance theater, Louie stopped up the pay telephone’s coin slots with toilet paper. He returned regularly to feed wire behind the coins stacked up inside, hook the paper, and fill his palms with change. A metal dealer never guessed that the grinning Italian kid who often came by to sell him armfuls of copper scrap had stolen the same scrap from his lot the night before. Discovering, while scuffling with an enemy at a circus, that adults would give quarters to fighting kids to pacify them, Louie declared a truce with the enemy and they cruised around staging brawls before strangers.

    To get even with a railcar conductor who wouldn’t stop for him, Louie greased the rails. When a teacher made him stand in a corner for spitballing, he deflated her car tires with toothpicks. After setting a legitimate Boy Scout state record in friction-fire ignition, he broke his record by soaking his tinder in gasoline and mixing it with match heads, causing a small explosion. He stole a neighbor’s coffee percolator tube, set up a sniper’s nest in a tree, crammed pepper-tree berries into his mouth, spat them through the tube, and sent the neighborhood girls running.

    His magnum opus became legend. Late one night, Louie climbed the steeple of a Baptist church, rigged the bell with piano wire, strung the wire into a nearby tree, and roused the police, the fire department, and all of Torrance with apparently spontaneous pealing. The more credulous townsfolk called it a sign from God.

    Only one thing scared him. When Louie was in late boyhood, a pilot landed a plane near Torrance and took Louie up for a flight. One might have expected such an intrepid child to be ecstatic, but the speed and altitude frightened him. From that day on, he wanted nothing to do with airplanes.

    In a childhood of artful dodging, Louie made more than just mischief. He shaped who he would be in manhood. Confident that he was clever, resourceful, and bold enough to escape any predicament, he was almost incapable of discouragement. When history carried him into war, this resilient optimism would define him.
Louie was twenty months younger than his brother, who was everything he was not. Pete Zamperini was handsome, popular, impeccably groomed, polite to elders and avuncular to juniors, silky smooth with girls, and blessed with such sound judgment that even when he was a child, his parents consulted him on difficult decisions. He ushered his mother into her seat at dinner, turned in at seven, and tucked his alarm clock under his pillow so as not to wake Louie, with whom he shared a bed. He rose at two-thirty to run a three-hour paper route, and deposited all his earnings in the bank, which would swallow every penny when the Depression hit. He had a lovely singing voice and a gallant habit of carrying pins in his pant cuffs, in case his dance partner’s dress strap failed. He once saved a girl from drowning. Pete radiated a gentle but impressive authority that led everyone he met, even adults, to be swayed by his opinion. Even Louie, who made a religion out of heeding no one, did as Pete said.

    Louie idolized Pete, who watched over him and their younger sisters, Sylvia and Virginia, with paternal protectiveness. But Louie was eclipsed, and he never heard the end of it. Sylvia would recall her mother tearfully telling Louie how she wished he could be more like Pete. What made it more galling was that Pete’s reputation was part myth. Though Pete earned grades little better than Louie’s failing ones, his principal assumed that he was a straight-A student. On the night of Torrance’s church bell miracle, a well-directed flashlight would have revealed Pete’s legs dangling from the tree alongside Louie’s. And Louie wasn’t always the only Zamperini boy who could be seen sprinting down the alley with food that had lately belonged to the neighbors. But it never occurred to anyone to suspect Pete of anything. “Pete never got caught,” said Sylvia. “Louie always got caught.”

    Nothing about Louie fit with other kids. He was a puny boy, and in his first years in Torrance, his lungs were still compromised enough from the pneumonia that in picnic footraces, every girl in town could dust him. His features, which would later settle into pleasant collaboration, were growing at different rates, giving him a curious face that seemed designed by committee. His ears leaned sidelong off his head like holstered pistols, and above them waved a calamity of black hair that mortified him. He attacked it with his aunt Margie’s hot iron, hobbled it in a silk stocking every night, and slathered it with so much olive oil that flies trailed him to school. It did no good.

    And then there was his ethnicity. In Torrance in the early 1920s, Italians were held in such disdain that when the Zamperinis arrived, the neighbors petitioned the city council to keep them out. Louie, who knew only a smattering of English until he was in grade school, couldn’t hide his pedigree. He survived kindergarten by keeping mum, but in first grade, when he blurted out “Brutte bastarde!” at another kid, his teachers caught on. They compounded his misery by holding him back a grade.

    He was a marked boy. Bullies, drawn by his oddity and hoping to goad him into uttering Italian curses, pelted him with rocks, taunted him, punched him, and kicked him. He tried buying their mercy with his lunch, but they pummeled him anyway, leaving him bloody. He could have ended the beatings by running away or succumbing to tears, but he refused to do either. “You could beat him to death,” said Sylvia, “and he wouldn’t say ‘ouch’ or cry.” He just put his hands in front of his face and took it.

As Louie neared his teens, he took a hard turn. Aloof and bristling, he lurked around the edges of Torrance, his only friendships forged loosely with rough boys who followed his lead. He became so germophobic that he wouldn’t tolerate anyone coming near his food. Though he could be a sweet boy, he was often short-tempered and obstreperous. He feigned toughness, but was secretly tormented. Kids passing into parties would see him lingering outside, unable to work up the courage to walk in.

    Frustrated at his inability to defend himself, he made a study of it. His father taught him how to work a punching bag and made him a barbell from two lead-filled coffee cans welded to a pipe. The next time a bully came at Louie, he ducked left and swung his right fist straight into the boy’s mouth. The bully shrieked, his tooth broken, and fled. The feeling of lightness that Louie experienced on his walk home was one he would never forget.

    Over time, Louie’s temper grew wilder, his fuse shorter, his skills sharper. He socked a girl. He pushed a teacher. He pelted a policeman with rotten tomatoes. Kids who crossed him wound up with fat lips, and bullies learned to give him a wide berth. He once came upon Pete in their front yard, in a standoff with another boy. Both boys had their fists in front of their chins, each waiting for the other to swing. “Louie can’t stand it,” remembered Pete. “He’s standing there, ‘Hit him, Pete! Hit him, Pete!’ I’m waiting there, and all of a sudden Louie turns around and smacks this guy right in the gut. And then he runs!”

    Anthony Zamperini was at his wits’ end. The police always seemed to be on the front porch, trying to talk sense into Louie. There were neighbors to be apologized to and damages to be compensated for with money that Anthony couldn’t spare. Adoring his son but exasperated by his behavior, Anthony delivered frequent, forceful spankings. Once, after he’d caught Louie wiggling through a window in the middle of the night, he delivered a kick to the rear so forceful that it lifted Louie off the floor. Louie absorbed the punishment in tearless silence, then committed the same crimes again, just to show he could.

    Louie’s mother, Louise, took a different tack. Louie was a copy of herself, right down to the vivid blue eyes. When pushed, she shoved; sold a bad cut of meat, she’d march down to the butcher, frying pan in hand. Loving mischief, she spread icing over a cardboard box and presented it as a birthday cake to a neighbor, who promptly got the knife stuck. When Pete told her he’d drink his castor oil if she gave him a box of candy, she agreed, watched him drink it, then handed him an empty candy box. “You only asked for the box, honey,” she said with a smile. “That’s all I got.” And she understood Louie’s restiveness. One Halloween, she dressed as a boy and raced around town trick-or-treating with Louie and Pete. A gang of kids, thinking she was one of the local toughs, tackled her and tried to steal her pants. Little Louise Zamperini, mother of four, was deep in the melee when the cops picked her up for brawling.

    Knowing that punishing Louie would only provoke his defiance, Louise took a surreptitious route toward reforming him. In search of an informant, she worked over Louie’s schoolmates with homemade pie and turned up a soft boy named Hugh, whose sweet tooth was Louie’s undoing. Louise suddenly knew everything Louie was up to, and her children wondered if she had developed psychic powers. Sure that Sylvia was snitching, Louie refused to sit at the supper table with her, eating his meals in spiteful solitude off the open oven door. He once became so enraged with her that he chased her around the block. Outrunning Louie for the only time in her life, Sylvia cut down the alley and dove into her father’s work shed. Louie flushed her out by feeding his three-foot-long pet snake into the crawl space. She then locked herself in the family car and didn’t come out for an entire afternoon. “It was a matter of life and death,” she said some seventy-five years later.

    For all her efforts, Louise couldn’t change Louie. He ran away and wandered around San Diego for days, sleeping under a highway overpass. He tried to ride a steer in a pasture, got tossed onto the ragged edge of a fallen tree, and limped home with his gashed knee bound in a handkerchief. Twenty-seven stitches didn’t tame him. He hit one kid so hard that he broke his nose. He upended another boy and stuffed paper towels in his mouth. Parents forbade their kids from going near him. A farmer, furious over Louie’s robberies, loaded his shotgun with rock salt and blasted him in the tail. Louie beat one kid so badly, leaving him unconscious in a ditch, that he was afraid he’d killed him. When Louise saw the blood on Louie’s fists, she burst into tears.

As Louie prepared to start Torrance High, he was looking less like an impish kid and more like a dangerous young man. High school would be the end of his education. There was no money for college; Anthony’s paycheck ran out before the week’s end, forcing Louise to improvise meals out of eggplant, milk, stale bread, wild mushrooms, and rabbits that Louie and Pete shot in the fields. With flunking grades and no skills, Louie had no chance for a scholarship. It was unlikely that he could land a job. The Depression had come, and the unemployment rate was nearing 25 percent. Louie had no real ambitions. If asked what he wanted to be, his answer would have been “cowboy.”
    In the 1930s, America was infatuated with the pseudoscience of eugenics and its promise of strengthening the human race by culling the “unfit” from the genetic pool. Along with the “feebleminded,” insane, and criminal, those so classified included women who had sex out of wedlock (considered a mental illness), orphans, the disabled, the poor, the homeless, epileptics, masturbators, the blind and the deaf, alcoholics, and girls whose genitals exceeded certain measurements. Some eugenicists advocated euthanasia, and in mental hospitals, this was quietly carried out on scores of people through “lethal neglect” or outright murder. At one Illinois mental hospital, new patients were dosed with milk from cows infected with tuberculosis, in the belief that only the undesirable would perish. As many as four in ten of these patients died. A more popular tool of eugenics was forced sterilization, employed on a raft of lost souls who, through misbehavior or misfortune, fell into the hands of state governments. By 1930, when Louie was entering his teens, California was enraptured with eugenics, and would ultimately sterilize some twenty thousand people.

    When Louie was in his early teens, an event in Torrance brought reality home. A kid from Louie’s neighborhood was deemed feebleminded, institutionalized, and barely saved from sterilization through a frantic legal effort by his parents, funded by their Torrance neighbors. Tutored by Louie’s siblings, the boy earned straight A’s. Louie was never more than an inch from juvenile hall or jail, and as a serial troublemaker, a failing student, and a suspect Italian, he was just the sort of rogue that eugenicists wanted to cull. Suddenly understanding what he was risking, he felt deeply shaken.

    The person that Louie had become was not, he knew, his authentic self. He made hesitant efforts to connect to others. He scrubbed the kitchen floor to surprise his mother, but she assumed that Pete had done it. While his father was out of town, Louie overhauled the engine on the family’s Marmon Roosevelt Straight-8 sedan. He baked biscuits and gave them away; when his mother, tired of the mess, booted him from her kitchen, he resumed baking in a neighbor’s house. He doled out nearly everything he stole. He was “bighearted,” said Pete. “Louie would give away anything, whether it was his or not.”

    Each attempt he made to right himself ended wrong. He holed up alone, reading Zane Grey novels and wishing himself into them, a man and his horse on the frontier, broken off from the world. He haunted the theater for western movies, losing track of the plots while he stared at the scenery. On some nights, he’d drag his bedding into the yard to sleep alone. On others, he’d lie awake in bed, beneath pinups of movie cowboy Tom Mix and his wonder horse, Tony, feeling snared on something from which he couldn’t kick free.

    In the back bedroom he could hear trains passing. Lying beside his sleeping brother, he’d listen to the broad, low sound: faint, then rising, faint again, then a high, beckoning whistle, then gone. The sound of it brought goose bumps. Lost in longing, Louie imagined himself on a train, rolling into country he couldn’t see, growing smaller and more distant until he disappeared.",misc

I wanne go to both heaven and hell
I wanne dive in and fly by emotions
Put my devotion to good use

Time to redefine the definition of time
Time is more than the numbers
Time is more than the lessons learned more so the lessons earned

The pieces we put togеther from the days of our greatеst depressions are only understand
Through the art of confession.

Meaning:

this song is about excepting yourself, even the good and bad parts (heaven and hell)
I was so focused on finding what was wrong with me and forgetting to see the things I've bin doing right, so drowned in what people though of my poems my look and it's a terrible thing but also understandable thing in this age of social media so I disconnected for a bit and truly focus on the beautiful things in my life (put my devotion to good use/time to be selfish)
And I realised in a strange way I asked for this, I wanted to be something great and in order to be great life has got to mold me into that
I went through processes of grieve envy jealousy and straight up betrayal that I inflicted myself and also a process of relieve, happiness and understanding
I had to go through all of that and I always will
I think we all do as humans but in being honest with ourselves in confessing that we are the worst and best part of ourselves it can help us understand why we do the things we do, where these things came from and how to better handle them.

I feel shadows watching my every move

I found the bottle it was gone so long, now it's back here in my arms

Now the day is done
It's time to face it all
Now it all seeps in
I'm crashing down
Darkness around
Chaos inside
I just need to feel alive

I found the needle it was gone so long
Now it's back here in my arm

I was told I'm alone and I guess you're fucking right
Here I stand with no one but the shadow to hold me
Slowly slowly going down
Slowly slipping giving up
Holding on, letting go
What the fuck is going on
Voices calling, spiders crawling
Scratch the skin, don't let them in
Overwhelming, shadows screaming
Nighty terrors haunting me

I was told I'm alone and I guess you're fucking right
Here I stand with no one but the shadow to hold me

Here I stand with no one but the shadow to hold me

Holding on, letting go

Tears are flowing
Incoherent screaming
Blood is dripping from my wrists
Everything is fading now
Pain is finally letting go

I was told I'm alone and I guess you're fucking wrong
Here I stand surrounded by the umbra I can't breath
Please just help me, slowly slipping
Going down, slowly slipping
Giving up, getting tired, letting go now
I guess I wasn't strong enough
I can see I'm not alone here in my bed
In the numbra I can't breath
Please just help me, slowly slipping
Giving up, quickly falling

Guess I wasn't strong enough

I've been waiting on a promise given to me
Folding all the corners and testing with my teeth
You wouldn't let a sparrow fall down
So how come I'm still testing my crown?
And ripping off the edges and crumpling in my hands
How often must I formulate my plans?
You wouldn't let a sparrow fall down

I don't know a thing about mapping my routes
A compass in my hand the only clue
So come and relinquish all my duties I have
They're weighing me down
And I can feel a canker spreading
Begins at my hands, and the feet is where I'm dreading
Perhaps I'll surrender it all
And you'll hold me real close

I'll follow you
Even when my limbs hang loose
Even when my body should refuse to
I'll follow you
Even when my limbs hang loose
Even when my body should refuse

You unfold the paper and with writer's pen you show
My understanding was not overgrown
You wouldn't let a sparrow fall down
So you begin adjusting my crown
Encrusting all the jewels and bandaging around the rim
Where edges previously cut through my skin
You wouldn't let a sparrow fall down

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know a thing about mapping my roots
The compass my hand the only clue
But then you relinquished all my duties I had
They were weighing me down
And then I felt a canker spreading
Begun on my hands and the feet was where I was dreading
But then I surrendered it all
And you still hold me real close

I'll follow you
Even when my limbs hang loose
Even when my body should refuse to
I'll follow you

Even when my limbs hang loose (Could my worry add an hour to my day?)
Even when my body should refuse to

I'll follow you (Feeling like a prophet and no longer like a fool)

Even when my body should refuse

High above the creaky staircase
Hangs the painting on the wall
In a house, long forgotten
The painting's left to rot alone
A lake so peaceful in the night time
The moon's reflection shining bright
A creeping shadow from the darkness
Approaches to the light
The moon's reflection starts to whither
From the wind that comes to life
A lightning flash, distant thunder
There she strolls in mind to die
This painting tells a story
A tragic death into the past
No one knows when it happened
Or how it came to pass
Every time the clock strikes midnight
The painting glows alive
The secret once that was forgotten
Has come to show into the light
The woman walks into the water
Slowly sinking to the depths
There she stays beneath the surface
No return, her mind is set
The painting then begins to darken
The wind slowly starts to drown
The water calms, a mournful sadness
A vanished moon, the painting stands
The secret once that was forgotten
Is not her death, but why she drowned
A failing marriage, a loved ones passing
Or a madness'ending now
This painting tells a story
A tragic death into the past
No one knows when it happened
Or how it came to pass

But I can't take that risk, I can't afford to lose my sunshine
Born in South Africa we never had much
But every time it hurt man at least we had us
Older brother, sister, mama, all I ever needed
Looking back I can say they're the main reason I succeeded
[Pre-Chorus]
They don't want the old me, they just want the new me
I just wanna be the motherfuckin' real me (real shit)
People say they know me, but I know they phoney
Second that I turn my back, they'll try to kill me

[Chorus]
They can't penetrate my heart, this shit is made of stone
So many nights I watched my momma cry when I was home
Man I can't believe I really made it, did it on my own
Miss me with that fake love, I don't fuck with silicone
They can't penetrate my heart, this shit is made of stone
So many nights I watched my momma cry when I was home
Man I can't believe I really made it, did it on my own
Miss me with that fake love, I don't fuck with silicone

[Verse 2]
Fake love so disgusting man it makes me vomit
Ever had a homie who just did some shit so outta pocket?
Can't believe you'd take it there
Said you'd never take it there
If I had a dollar for all the times you said it I'd be a millionaire
Before I was a millionaire
That shit is getting weak
So much bogus energy been saying it all week
I changed my number so many times man, I'd be outta reach
I can't be in these streets
That's why I'm always in the studio man I just need a beat
And when I hit record
Everything outside these headphones they just get ignored
I put my life on pause
And even family can't get a hold of me that's what you- damn
That's what you call a double edged sword
And lately man it's crazy
The dedication in my blood has got me feeling wavy
I put in work until this music shit was gonna work
That fan mail hit you different when you came up from the dirt
[Pre-Chorus]
They don't want the old me, they just want the new me
I just wanna be the motherfuckin' real me (real shit)
People say they know me, but I know they phoney
Second that I turn my back, they'll try to kill me

[Chorus]
They can't penetrate my heart, this shit is made of stone
So many nights I watched my momma cry when I was home
Man I can't believe I really made it, did it on my own
Miss me with that fake love, I don't fuck with silicone
They can't penetrate my heart, this shit is made of stone
So many nights I watched my momma cry when I was home
Man I can't believe I really made it, did it on my own
Miss me with that fake love, I don't fuck with silicone",rap

Are you the one to judge us all?
I'm getting scared and angry
We're closing in on our downfall
We need a new beginning
I'm tired of this mess
This road will lead us nowhere
I'm done with their fake promises

In line to prove their perfection
I'd rather walk in another direction

Nothing to prove
And everything to gain

There's nothing we can't do ('cuz we got)
Nothing to prove
And everything to gain
We got a mind of our own
We're the outcasts and the future of today
Welcome to mass confusion
Sit down the show will soon begin
With ears and eyes wide open
Are we expected to give in
I'm here to make a statement
I'm here to rise against
It's all a big illusion
Downhill goes the establishment

In line to prove their perfection
I'd rather walk in another direction

Nothing to prove
And everything to gain
We got a mind of our own
There's nothing we can't do ('cuz we got)
Nothing to prove
And everything to gain
We got a mind of our own
We're the outcasts and the future of today

One more thing I've got to say
You can reject us but you'll never take our voice away
One more step, moving on
Join the parade of better days and let the
Present future in
Nothing to prove
And everything to gain
We got a mind of our own
There's nothing we can't do '(cuz we got)
Nothing to prove
And everything to gain

And breathes so softly

She stares into the plane of glass
And whispers softly
Something's missing

Looks past the edge of photographs
Pictures blurring
No one's listening

You save the best but know there's never time
You hide the pain behind a liar's smile
But I can see the sorrows never end
Misplace the blame again

Misery begins when you stop believing
Is this your ever after?
Misery's the end and it's coming faster
Just remember I believe in you
Bows before the colored glass
And whispers softly
Can you hear me

She lives in castles made of sand
And she can't believe
She can't believe, can't believe
They crumble down again

You save the best but know there's never time
You hide the pain behind a liar's smile

Now, being that the fact is (uh), you was a fly New Yorker
You could of wrote me off as some kind of sick stalker
But I guess I was kind of a slick talker
Charmed you real quick, then made a mean offer
Now we livin like Mr. and Mrs. Walker
Cause even if we was stranded, we'd be hand and hand, Miss
Thing, body that bang, I can't stay away (uh)
I think 'em about to get this ring off layaway
And shine up this knee, it's been a little too long
We've Been ""Holdin Each Other Down"" just like the Alchemist song (hold you down)
So to not give you no props up on this album is wrong
When you put your soul in somethin, yo the outcome is strong
And them long nights on the road is torturous (right)
But every show is just another step towards our fort-a-ress
I see you doin your thang too
We could make beautiful music together with the way you sang, woo
So while I'm starin out my tour bus window (uh)
Rollin through Los Angeles and San Francisco
I'm thinkin about you buggin out, singin some disco (right)
And all that other shit that I miss yo
Cause listen up, I ain't tryin to be Jared at Subway
I want your arroz con pollo cooked for me lovely
You knew me from a scrub to today (uh)
The clubs that I play, make me glad I didn't meet you in one (hell yeah)
And when my people from the hood see me
They tell me that our shit would really make some good TV
But we ain't goin out like Jessica and Nick Lachey
Because people always be havin bullshit to say
And I ain't worried 'bout no number one hit today
I'm just writin this to say, good lookin out
Thanks for gettin my back even when I was actin whack (what)
All depressed, and talkin 'bout quittin rap
My fans don't know it but they owe a lot to you (uh)
Cause you reminded me, that a man's got to do, what a man's got to do
Truer words were never spoken (no doubt)
Without your help, I might have been forever broken
But now I got sublime rhymes, ready for prime time
When me and my dime shine, it's brighter than the brightest constellation (woo)
It took the tightest concentration and I'm a give that ass a demonstration
When I get home (uh), yeah, I got work to do
When I get back home to you (soon as I get home)

You're dying in vain, Pain

Did it all to avoid the war

Feeling unique don't sweat technique
Got Genjutsu you couldn't complete, not worth killing, easy defeat
Don't gaze my way, boy, don't even look at my feet

Stepping up to me is a valiant effort
But you might just get hurt, but screw it, right?
Kakuzu'll spit the terror, we're gonna be loving the way they're gonna screaming at the top of their lungs
It will not be making a difference, we're gonna be leaving you stunned
You're about to be bodied by the undead, hunted, multiple massacres from the rugged
Wanted, we'll slaughter a village leaving you gutted, busted when the Akatsuki leaves the building
We're leaving no trace, leaving everything maimed
Including your face, deformed and misplaced
Keep torn and you fakes were born to be waste
Reformed for mistakes, appalled by your own face
[Verse 6: Kakuzu (NightBreaker)]
I'm dropping bodies two by two, knocking you frauds just to spite you
Sowing a seed deep inside you, ripping it out with delight to
Brought shame upon my village when I failed to kill the First Hokage
Now I'm only in it for the money, think I'm greedy? I'll say
Cold as an icicle
Threads are deadly, run fast as a bison cult
Better ready yourself cause I might just go
Willy nilly, prepare for some fighting bro
Be aware when I'm ripping the hearts off, anyone challenging brutal, I'm such a cold-hearted dude
Watch your back when I hit up my boy Hidan, perform our Combo moves
A born and raised assassin, so watch out whatever you do, body parts are extending to Zombie Combo on you two
Threading them to Oblivion, some might say I'm a cruel dude, I am immortal so try to step to me and then you're screwed

[Verse 7: Sasori (IAMCHRISCRAIG)]
Messing with my squadron, you're destined to be a dead man
Out of Hiruko, I am Sasori of the Red Sand
Chiyo's descendent the realest contender who senses the fear in your sweat glands
I'm a tactical genius and vet, man, if you're trying me, you owe me debt fam
Put the Third Kazekage to death, me and Deidara we stay catching bodies
Opponents battle, I be having them stressed, with performing puppets I got hundreds applauding
You don't know about the core in my chest, the main reason I be killing a lot
I'm not human, these emotions lucid, so I'm quick to up and put you kids in a box
If you wanna battle I am not the man to mess with
You have all to catch a poison dagger in your neck quick
Shall we get right to it, it is time to pay your debt trick
Mess with the Akatsuki and it's time to grant a death wish

[Verse 8: Konan (Twisted Savvy)]
I can make a whole village out of paper
A couple tags for some Konoha haters
Time for you to meet the creator
OG of the three to cover you with plaster
Deadly S rank that's throwing blanks, Akatsuki's coming, better run em to the bank
Power gained, Toad Sage to thank for what's in store, every Ninja's gonna tank
Why won't you dance with a Shimigami? I wanna hear you scream
Drop to your knees and plead, reaching defeat, catch smoke from an angel you see
Surprise explosive tags
Butterflies for keeping tabs
Jutsu means we got it in the bag
Entered our land now there's no turning back
Inticing when I feel you attack
Sensory type I know where you're at
Just cuz I'm a chick I ain't cutting you slack
I'm about to show real life hacks
So watch my paper harden
Or the lake around you soften
My wings were made for arson
And this world has all been darkened

[Verse 9: Kisame (AfroLegacy)]
Listen cause a killing, all the blood that I'll be spilling
Shark, I'm hunting, this is thrilling, I'm one within a million
My presence is so chilling, got you feeling that you're dead
The best in the Akatsuki, gonna end with your head
Swinging my sword with a force, no remorse
It is par for the course, I'm sure this is war
I'm sure you messed up in this fight
Sure to be the last one in sight, say goodnight
The monster in the Hidden Mist
I'm way too strong, can't land a fist, I'm sorry, but my life's a bliss
It's your neck I will grab and twist, a boss you cannot mess with this
A Tailed Beast without a tail, stuck in jail, what a fail, missing hits
Drowning you out and I'm having no doubt
Cause the king is about and you're hearing me shout
And there's never a drought cause I'm going all out
When I'm striking the enemies and you're blacking out
Water controlling, through corpses I'm strolling
I'm rolling these clowns, they see me patrolling
The best in the team and my Chakra is golden
Hey Tobi, wanna go cut these chumps open?

[Verse 10: Tobi (Alltime Arcade)]
Cut em open? Why not explode em!
Got the great plain Jutsu reloading
But I'll hit with minefield explosions
And I got one eye to focus
Focusing my Mangekyo Sharingan
Rinnegan, what an arsenal
Rasengan, pathetic and gone
I left Kakuzu done, man, this is fun
A lyrical criminal, thinking little by little, a carnival of syllables
Killing the miracles, Itachi and Kakashi couldn't stop me
Now who else believes any Kage versus me
Would end in their defeat? Neat!
Got a Kumui flow on this beat
The real Madara will stay a mystery
Sorry if I sounded mean
But I'll bring it back like never seen
Sometime you can have a little fun
But it stopped when I set the best verse, done!
I been fooling everyone right until the end

I’ll come inside, the creator of your greatest ride
You captivate me
And you break me from my youth

Learn to see with my heart not eyes
When you look it’s not that hard to find
Feels divine when you see through my disguise
When you see through my...

My heart felt high last night
Couldn’t believe that it’s just you and I tonight
Burning through our veins, your light
Shed our fears
Lick our tears
Forever mine

Learn to see with my heart not eyes
When you look it’s not that hard to find
Feels divine when you see through my disguise
When you see through my...

Reconcile with your violent ghosts

Worst Regrets
Works of Progress
Such a tranquil fall from grace
Remember treading water in the spring
Time has gone passed away
Would you even recognize my face

From who we were
Still the kid I was back then
But stronger than before

I’m never settling
This is my life so it’s not your risk
So let me settle this

Thrive under burdens

In your head and too far away
You wanna wait for panic to subside
Cuz the maximal form is what we like

You wanna slake desire
But the feeling isn’t right
Stealing all that we can
To trade for time

Wanna know why
Wanna know why
Wanna know why
We all want to die

Getting over the grey takes sublime
Getting a word into chime takes a dime
When a flower falls from the vine
Will i be able to pull it up and find

That maybe i don’t know where to go
And will i hold to see where it goes
Every low seems to follow me, occupiеd
We are the cеnterpiece of the things we’re scared to deny
We wanna lace our doubt with time until the feeling is right
We are the lesser of either side when we choose to divide

We say we wanna love but we never reply
We never reply
We never reply

With debt up to our eyes
Tell us to fly
Tell us to fly
Tell us to fly

But there’s a ceiling in the sky
So nevermind

We say give it time

Practicin' your lines like recitals
Never asked for struggles

Now they lookin' at me like I’m cheesy
I love it how I hate it
But I hate it since I love it
All around the world is screamin'

Try myself positions
Fixin' all your problems like magicians
Never held back because I'm weird as fuck
It's not enough that I'm an outcast
Lookin' for a life thats-
Trapped, in an ocean full of normal people problems
I try to solve them
But their expressions are ""proud"" or somethin'
Fuck em! I don’t need em
Like some rich people attitude
Drop you like a sailor
Goin’ weaker than some dried loops
Poof! like exploiting your exes
Tools on the table, full of fake fuck niggas who just hate that shit
Split that shit, you with that bitch?

Keep it equal for the people but still disturb with words
I'm not concerned, I duck and dodge your views
It never seems to end a bad case of deja vu
I set the mood from the blues to the hyped tracks
I can't be moved, if I do I'll be right back
Might lack a little colour to the skin
No room for improvement, I move with the wind
Pull the pin, explode, got a short fuse
I'm bad news, get what you give and beggars can't choose
Run straight through, it ends up critical
Lyrically spiritual, out of this world that's metaphysical
Tools of the trade, I paint your pen
Tend to offend, live the life of the creme de la creme
Depend on no one, try bring me down
I got more tricks up my sleeve than a sideshow clown

[Verse 2: Optamus]
Check the elements, said I am just oh so eloquent
The veteran endeavour to summon up the adrenaline
Sweat trickling, magnificent emcees are impotent
Get rid of 'em, kick 'em out the door and then we're listening
To Drapht and Op' and after what I've got to say
People scream and understand the Syllabolical ways
We train our sword with the mic, we're laughable type of close
With Hunter heating up the crowd, we're liable to explode
On delivery, lyrically feel the Sylla-score festivity
Give me the microphone, I think it's in my vicinity

But it's about now, the sound surrounds the Sylla crew

Thriving on the dead bones and living on the passion
Adapting and grabbing anybody that wants to make it happen
I'm a captain, a corporal, let's keep this shit informal
Draphto, take it away and suck 'em into our portal

It's like before it starts I vanish without a trace
Never give you the chance to put the words to a face
I concentrate with a plan to conquer
You bite my bars like they were made by Willy Wonka
I'm on the ball and never sit on the sidelines
Every move watched like Jordan in his prime time
Evil Einstein, the future in my palm
Traits to take over the world fighting off Bush and Sadam
Heart be alarmed cause Drapht's a master of surprise
The illusion from the heat playing tricks on your eyes
I advise, it's liver than electrics
Don't wanna get too close 'cause I burn when this text hits
[Bridge: Optamus & Drapht]
The first thing's first, words hitting like sniper pot shots
I rise from the horizon knocking off the rock spots
And on this journey, take time to fucking study
This shit could turn bloody if you step to step-buddy
'Cause ugly scenes occur when you don't understand
An upper hand 'cause every word that we spit hits the fan
'Cause we began from this and that's where we started
I say goodbye to wack emcees and dearly departed

The tale of two titans enlightened, can't be silenced
On a higher level, the sort to resort to violence
We never settle, turn up the heat in battles
Always two sides to the story, mine and Scotty Babble's
No need for paddles, our flow will never end
Defend if you quick to diss my fam or my friends
If you lend your ear I can steer you the right way
If you turn your back, get fucked is what I might say
My way or no way, I never play fair
First one in the ring to swing a bat or a chair
No one-on-one, it's us against all
And we're not gonna stop till the last man falls

There I pulverize peasants, like I do this beat
Coming up to earth was kinda risky
‘cuz I rediscovered my love for big trees
The blunt be calling like hit me
I got enslaved to its peace like I’m a hippie
Feel like a tested on pig, guinea
Time to end this, time to get filthy
I’ll be invoking a slaughter
A cruel affair, don’t really care
No one is spared, not evеn your daughter
I’m the true hеir, I rule over there
He was so scared, was fun when I caught up
Should’ve seen him stare, wasn’t even fair
He couldn’t even bare that I looked like a monster
I made his death slow and painful
Now in hell he’s haunted
I got a compass that leads to weak ass bitches
And it's pointing to you, better tie your running shoes
I've become numb to the trees I'm hitting
So I'm hitting everything that moves
Included yo' mama, hit her with karma
She's a real bitch, but also my BFF
Spit hot shit at you like lama in the sauna
Anybody feeling this? 'cuz I am
Ain't no interfering with my pen
There ain't a single thing that I can't
What I do with the sentiment of a fan
I slit his wrists and I dance
Where are my manners?
Dancing like I do on a grave is just offensive
I’d hire a professional dancer
Make him do backflip if the guy had cancer
Laughing, when I know I shouldn’t
At least, according to Earth terms
In hell there ain’t a single demon that wouldn’t
I guess our morals are just reversed huh?
Give the first curse to a birth nurse
Make the babies she tends to burst burst
Hope it hurts her, like the third word
Refers to the verb I apply after I
To the dick to your mama, you heard?
The way I play with words is absurd
Skill like this only occurs
One in a million, still I’m the first
Demon to turn heads up on Earth
So take out your pen, take notes and learn
I am the king you will serve
And out of the 3 of us, I’m not even the worst

Down in hell, it’s a thing I do often
But up here it’s new and it’s fucking awesome!

Ain’t lust exhausting, I’d just forgotten
How much disgust I have for trust, it’s rotten
I must be softened by my dusty office
But let’s discuss stopping all this rushed talking
I’m as much a prophet as I am a dolphin
Caught Robin coughing, ‘cuz he wanted profit
But knowing Batman, that ain’t the way he’s rocking
So he’ll regret the day he dared to cross him
What am I spitting? I got distracted
Follow the rhythm and let him have it
Dare to say to me that I’m fucking average?
Your criticism goes in the fucking trash
Comes to lyricism, I’m the fucking best
Imma kill a rhythm like I do a guest
Ain’t no feelings in ‘em, put me to the test
I’ve been bitter sinning and it’s just messed up
Better get backup, Imma spit random
I’m childish, the reason is lamb trucks
It’s 'cuz I’m dreaming to be a fan of
A village that contains the last of
The demons inside of my head, hah!
This got me speaking like Kaelar
Accept my words are not unlike fine art
Let me tell you a vigorous tale
Of when they didn’t want to deliver us ale
I told ‘em that was an ambiguous sales strategy
And he started laughing at me?
I replied with a villainous stare
I do not, between us a difference, care
Slit his throat, drank his blood as liquor
He tried to fly high, like Icarus, fail
I’m picking apart clowns Pennywise
Sickest of all time, it’s terminal
Try to kill me, it’s like when Kenny dies
You won’t try twice, now it’s personal
She say I got a heart of stone, then she cries
So I removed hers surgically
Hold it up before her eyes
And performed on it the birds and the bees

Well I hope the money comes in someday

Under many of the steps that you take

I should be screaming out baby I'm alive

Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom
It's time for a holiday
Life is a cabaret, old chum

Come taste the wine
Come hear the band
Come blow your horn
Start celebrating right this way

What good's permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum
So come to the cabaret
I used to have this girlfriend known as Elsie
With whom I shared four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't what you'd call a blushing flower
As a matter of fact she rented by the hour
The day she died the neighbors came to snicker
""Well, that's what comes from too much pills and liquor""
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen
She was the happiest corpse, I'd ever seen
I think of Elsie to this very day
I remember how she'd turn to me and say
""What good is sitting all alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum
Come to the cabaret
And as for me
And as for me
I made my mind up, back in Chelsea
When I go, I'm going like Elsie
Start by admitting from cradle to tomb
Isn't that long a stay
Life is a cabaret, old chum
It's only a cabaret, old chum
And I love a cabaret",pop
4678,"Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.

It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of ""killed."" He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram, and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message.

She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a paralyzed inability to accept its significance. She wept at once, with sudden, wild abandonment, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.

There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.

She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.

There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.

She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.

She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed away off yonder on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.

There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and elusive to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.

Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will--as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been. When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: ""free, free, free!"" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.

She did not stop to ask if it were or were not a monstrous joy that held her. A clear and exalted perception enabled her to dismiss the suggestion as trivial. She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face that had never looked save with love upon her, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.
There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. A kind intention or a cruel intention made the act seem no less a crime as she looked upon it in that brief moment of illumination.

And yet she had loved him--sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in the face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!

""Free! Body and soul free!"" she kept whispering

Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhold, imploring for admission. ""Louise, open the door! I beg; open the door--you will make yourself ill. What are you doing, Louise? For heaven's sake open the door.""

""Go away. I am not making myself ill."" No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window

Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.

She arose at length and opened the door to her sister's importunities. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom

Some one was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his grip-sack and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.

When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease--of the joy that kills.",misc

I see the future in your e.y.e's so
There is no time for excuses and apologies
Just do your thing and shit work itself out
Just remember to keep the faith and never tap out
The only out you do is stand out from those who don’t Understand what you do for love
For the best way to live life is to live by what you love
Don't wait for Sundays just to talk to the up above
Though some days he doesn't respond
Know very well that all said was heard
When it’s all said and done
Take a look around at where you are how far you've came and where you going
Its important to keep in motion
For life is the journey and death is the terminal
That's the only thing that's a promise to man since birth
Life goes beyond the mortal world
The eternal life is where u seek to find the light
Sometimes you find yourself in a plight
Drowning life in a bottle or evaporating in a bong
But a painkiller is not the medication
Anastasia is not recuperation
For the soul you need meditation
Success is long process it takes dedication and a lot of patience
Stay true to yourself and believe in the  journey it's all I'm saying
It's all I'm saying to you in the mirror

In the end it wasn’t profitable
Depositing my time in goals is my mission now
Until that goal is scored there is no stopping the ball
It's me against the world and I’m twice as tall

Doing all this fraud got my computer on the back seat

Shoot a nigga in his face now he on the concrete

Took your bitch out to eat she just text me and said she's ready
Broke bitch tripping over some change, she's petty

Know this rich black nigga and he looks like P Diddy
Your bitch a little freak, asked me can I play with her kitty

I just wasted a fire ass piece buying a kitty
Busted a bank play up on 6 mile and [?]

I ain't bring my strap to the gas station, I'll be back

Now you're pissed off, that's why you never call me but
You're thinking ""is that another one about you""?
Don't boost your ego if you're about to
Your friends said ""you'll be better off without Scru""
Filling up your mind with your doubt but

[Hook]
Hey girl, tell me what's up
I don't know if you wanna fall in love
But right now I don't wanna hold you up but
There ain't no need, there ain't no need to rush
You're rolling up and you're going to see
If you wanna be down, you can roll with me
Just listen to the rhythm and flow with me
Girl there ain't no need, there ain't no need to rush

[Verse 2]
Uh, look, don't it ever pass your mind?
Maybe you're too good for me, are you asking why
Things are going this way? Maybe you'll go or maybe I will stay
I doubt I will change but I can make the thunderstorm rain
Doo-doo-dum-dum, I know you're stuck in your way but
You're feeling like you're smart again
Let's walk in the dark again and draw the art again
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
We're getting older, also getting wiser
Also getting smarter, so tell me am I closer
To your heart? I really should've know this from the start
Are you still stuck in the dark? Cause if you are
I wanna light your world up like I once did
Tell me baby, do you love me like you once did?
Or have you gone and run up to a dumb prick?
Tell the truth baby, I know that you want this but

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Woo! It's like this and like that and like this
Woo! It's like this, like that, like this
Woo! It's like this-
No need to rush, there is no need to rush
There is no need to, to, to, to
Like this

Couple figures and now all these bitches care for me
And fuck these niggas that was down and they ain't share with me
Soon as I started seein' money it was clear to me
These niggas not hungry for no money, that shit weird to me
Can't trust these niggas, so you know I'm movin' carefully
Fuckin' bitches three at once, that shit was rare for me
Critch got a few, I told him bring a spare for me
I tell my drummer come in air, he bring a snare for me

Niggas out of line
Tell me how you lookin' for us like we not outside
(Yeah, uh-uh)
Lucky we too occupied
.40 by the passenger, the FN by the driver side
So we put them shooters on you, then you got no time to hide
If you cross that line, I guarantee they leave you traumatized
You don't want them niggas kickin' doors out where your mom reside
[?], tyin' niggas up, this shit like I'm a Amistad
I remember when wasn't eatin', felt like Ramadan
Plate was empty, now we gettin' paid all the racks, so they envy
But my niggas was raised in the trap, they ain't friendly
So that boy could try to play and get clapped through his Fendi
Bro still gettin' paid skippin' states in that rentsky
I'ma make a play, put the block in a frenzy
Give my dog a plate, he made that to a ten-piece
Hood Fave, niggas hate, don't know what they got against me
[Verse 2: Don Q]
Black sweats I wore for days 'til it fade and it's linted
They throwin' shots my way, but it ain't graze me or nip me
If they kill me where I stay, will the parade like I'm Nipsey?
They always take away the greats, it's a shame how this shit be
Let's go flow for flow, nigga
I bet I steal a show if we go toe for toe, nigga
Pedicures on my bitch, she love to show her toes
And the extra girl suckin' dick goin' blow for blow with her
I got tints behind the burban and you can't see when I slide up
I got hints that you was workin', you ain't think we would find out
They been doubtin' in they dreams, they been seein' us die out
I'ma scout, you wanna be up on my team? Come and tryout
I got a startin' five of porn stars, I treat 'em like they all-stars
They numbers never stored, but they recent in my call logs
I keep my Spanish mami on guard, my white bitch play the small forward
My black bitch in the post, whoever miss, she grabbin' all boards

This molly got us zombie, got me feeling all sedated
White girl loving
With a van full of hippies
Who love us, so lovely
They didn't even hesitate to touch us
They love us, so we lust them
No one will catch them
No one can help them
Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
Yeah, I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo (Echo, echo, echo)
Echo (Echo, echo, echo)
""I heard he do drugs now""
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?""
""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

It swept beneath my feet and wrapped around my head
It resembled my frame of mind with nothing better to say
I was leaving it all behind to resonate through the years and crush me day by day
I could feel it pull break neck speed to say my last goodbyes
The discontent to let everything go
Hanging over my head like a noose around my neck
Cause you're not all that different, over everything
We're not all that different, after everything
True hell, is life, gone wrong
So looking back at these dreams, slipping down through my sleep
I couldn't tell you what the fuck was even happening to me
I counted rocks on the cliffs as I fell down to the sea
I could feel it all slipping away
I float on slick black water paralyzed neck deep as I drowned in sleep
Like Ophelia's last hour, unaware, drifting",rock

You got to slow this vehicle down now
Before we get too far

And as usual she is flanked by her husband and her brother
And she's dancing like there's no tomorrow

She's got the whole crowd in the palm of her hand
Singing a song that was written by her dad
And the whole crowd are singing with her

She's coming to a city or a town near you
In a polka dot dress and a pair of red shoes
With a flagon full of booze

So ladies and gentlemen, let's raise a glass for Lorna
She's a singer, she's a dancer
A party starter and a damn hard worker

Well she worked in an office, back when the band was formed
There was no way she was letting the boys have all the fun
So she took some singing lessons and she informed them she was joining

Now ten years later, they're still going strong
Winning hearts and minds wherever they perform
And they travel all over the land, the Skinny Lister family band
So ladies and gentlemen, let's raise a glass for Lorna
She's a singer, she's a dancer
A party starter and a damn hard worker
Let's have a round of applause for Lorna

Well as arrogant as it sounds I see myself in her
Did you know that we were born just a few days apart
Underneath the very same stars
We're both 1980s sagittarius
And she beats me at cards every time we play
She beats me at pool and at paper, scissors, stone
Or at anything mildly competitive
Oh I cherish our friendship

Ooh

Take it nice and slow
We'll make sure the mood is right

Look into each other eyes
And make love to our favorite song

The good times we had somehow strayed away
Let's put our love back
Put loving back how it used to be

Coming through the same window;
At the same time;
To wake you up to the same day;
Of the same pain...
Of the same extreme boredom...
Of the same frustrations; and you see where this goes...

Faded cause I always under dose;

Up till the sun-rises;

Today again I pray that you don’t

Uh

Back in early years envious towards my peers cause they all had fathers that showed em caring and left em, it wasn't good for me
Only mama would work for, fight for me, father for me, even though they both left me, I guess the company of loneliness really helped me
I watched the other kids grow up with a smile it me quite a while and all my childhood pain stung and scarred through my brain
No friends just a family misery is the only thing stored in my memory, a grown seed raised in this dying breed another grown seed
Raised in this dying breed

[Hook: Big O]

I'm just another lost seed in this dying breed
I'm just another lost seed in this dying breed
My thoughts and all my fears is what this pen bleeds
In this dying breed

[Verse 2: Big O]

In our times who can you trust friends wanna use you for your fame and dirty up your name so they live safe
Why I act notorious cause I need faith but I lost touch with God, always have a bible cause mama said
That's the weapon for survival I always fall but I never trip, always acting outta hand cause they raised me with no grip
Plus we never played outside, cause they killin each other or they robbin or they ride witnesses of homicide
My daddy had me caged burnt and abused so my mind only knew rage, family holocaust with no remorse bloodline full of greed
A product of the dying breed

[Hook]

Without family I love none, my own girl dumped me for the sun, I wonder if he'd grow to be like me if I Had a son
My cousins underground or in the pen, we learnt how to drink and commit ordinary sins where does I begins
To be beautiful you need to be a certain skin tone body of a shark but I'm just an average fish bone
Just a clown with no orange skin tone, too many seeds cause too many parents follow the Flintstones
They never made love just pleasure what they greed, and you wonder why youngin's pregnant in this dying breed

Never let me go from this place

For a break that would make it okay

To feel not good enough

Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
Storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees
In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here

Her note read ...so long savvy, I haven't gone away!

What? what went wrong?
I don't underst... I oh a

And I found her an' pulled my gun, an' fired point blank
The shot whistled right past that woman's head
An' I killed my hound dog, dead!

I will wait for you to come. I’ll make you happy one day
You’ll be sorry soon because I really hate you

Who'd come and take her down the mountain every Friday night
And let her dance 'til the Saturday sun come up

And every Friday night, you could see us at the diner
Havin' dinner 'fore the dance began
Slippin' and slidin' on a chocolate soda

I love that rhythm in her feet
Wild Millie, this mountain world
Is all you're ever gonna need

I took her to the carnivals and took her to the fairs
And took her to the altar of love
We got married, got a love and gonna share it
And we'll dance every Friday at the auditorium
'Cause I made her a promise on the tin cans strung
To the back of the pickup truck
That I'd take her down the mountain every Friday night
And let her dance 'til the Saturday sun come up

Soft-shoeing around on a walkin' cane

And we'd head down the mountain 'cause it's Friday night

As in a grave; but trusting, said:

Bloom from the ashes of the dead.""

With selfishness it longed and ached,
And cried: ""I have not half I need.
My thirst is bitter and unslaked.
But to the New Year's generous hand
All gifts in plenty shall return;
True love it shall understand;
By all y failures it shall learn.
I have been reckless; it shall be
Quiet and calm and pure of life.
I was a slave; it shall go free,
And find sweet pace where I leave strife.""

Never a night such changes brought.
The Old Year had its work to do;
No New Year miracles are wrought.

Always a night from old to new!
Night and the healing balm of sleep!

Morn of a festival to keep.

All I know is that I want to be with you
You turn your back on me
Crushing my heart and all of my dreams
But I don't care baby, you know it
Doesn’t matter what you do, baby I'll be loving you


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Doesn't matter what you do baby I'll be loving you

Doesn't matter what you do baby I'll be loving you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Doesn’t matter what you
Doesn’t matter what you do
I make my to you
Moving across the floor
You give me a look, now making towards the door
Out in the moonlight I see you
Being pretty as can bе
The look of want in your face
To bad it wasn't for me

Now your thеre by yourself
When I could be your someone else

I wanna hold you tight
Come on baby, hold on tight
We can make a life together
Here and now, in this weather
I know this is hard to hear, but can’t you see, don't you fear
Cause you know it doesn't matter what you do
Doesn't matter what you do

Stay with me tonight
I just want you to myself
And though it hurts to try
I don’t want nobody else
I don't want nobody else

Theres a smile on your face
And now I know this is fate
So when we plan our first date
Oh we're standing right here
Now we're shedding a tear
Now we're falling apart
But you know just what to say which goes straight to my heart
I wanna hold you tight
Come on baby, hold on tight
We can make a life together
Here and now, in this weather
I know its hard to hear, but can't you see, don't you fear
Cause you know it doesn't matter what you do
Doesn't matter what you do
Baby ill be loving you

Searching for the pieces, to my heart

Tunnel vision has worn off
Now that you're gone
I wish I, was more, honest, with you

Like telling you, how I felt
Instead of being distant, I didn't think
That we could grow, so I left
Before we had the chance, to know

Or waited on another day
I was working toward my future plans
And let my other future walk away

Had too much pride at the time
To let you know, maybe I
Did quit too soon

You did too, oh ahhh baby, baby

In vain to shed your skin
When your lonesome servant calls
Will you rise to let him in?

Throughout recorded history, philosophers have queried:
Am I a person, or am I a brand?
Luckily, in our modern world, we no longer need to choose between these two sublime options
But full coordination of your personhood and your branding can be... challenging
And that's why I'm here to help turn your humanity into your hu-brand-ity
Hello
I'm Hugh Brandity
Welcome to my seminar entitled ""Building Your Online Brand.""

[Sung]
A brand is your soul's own work of art
You can never go wrong if you follow your heart
Assuming your heart's obsessed with what is best
And what's best is anything that can give you a following

Your brand can range from simple to obtuse
Do you bake fancy cakes or do you rate hot moose?
It's not incorrect if you expect to always collect
Views when you stay on brand!
[Spoken]
You see a brand is much like a flower
In that it stinks and takes its own path
If you think you know how it will grow
Then you've never tasted nature's wrath

Say you've mentioned offhand that you enjoy
Ice cream sandwiches on a hot cruise
Expect some tweets about ice cream sandies every time they're in the news

People saying ""Sandies are on sale!""
""I love sandies, too!""
""Sandies in the mail!""
""Made some sandies, Hugh!""
There is no escaping from the

Ice cream sandwich din
Everywhere I go
When did it begin?
This pain that I know
Seems it has been shaping from the

Simplest of things
Didn't give a second thought
And the repercussions came too soon
And that's why you must contemplate building a brand
By musing in a brand cocoon
[Sung]
Let your brandity brand cocoon slowly accrete
Because your holometabolous is nearly complete
When you venture from here you'll know no fear!
Everything is clear
Your brand is all consuming once it has its premiere

So get ready, you'll soon be so much more
Let's hope your branded existence is not one you abhor
Open your eyes!
And arise!
Make a stand!
And reveal your brand

[Spoken: Karen & Brian]
I teach rodent fitness classes on Periscope now
Another brand successfully built
I do unboxing videos for past a brands now
I do wholesome pranks on my elderly neighbor now
I do equine fashion reviews
I take artistic photos of myself spilling cans of beans now
I knit scarves for ferrets now
I respond to tweets from elected officials with pictures of my son bowling now",pop
2128,"These things that you say never come to pass
And you blow it away with every last laugh
It's not worth knowing
I really must be going now

This time you really let me down

The things you don't do or just never come through
And you piss it away each and every day
Something is showing
But it's not worth knowing now

This world must be destroyed
No time, no place, and no human race

An enthusiast error beats silent knowledge
You're quite intelligent or so you've acknowledged
Nothing's worth knowing
But that still isn't showing now",pop

Tripping up over words, falling

Still love me a little

I hate the words that you say
When you're wishing me well
Like I need some time to be on my own
But it makes me sick to think of you with somebody else
And darling I wait for you coming home

Tripping up over words, calling
And I can't take it anymore

Telling life can't always be that easy
The things that I must do
Jeopardise my life with you

Once the screens have fed the masses
Spread the secret that limits their lives...

Lights ahead, I failed the mission of my life
My skin dissolves, my soul will last forever
Lights all around, I feel serenity
But something's hunting me from inside
The torrent is on I will play their game

I am your angel here to guide you
Come with me, you're not alone!

Life flash before my eyes
Until my last endeavour
Failed me
I've come to realize
I have to rectify
Searching for redemption still
Until my final victory
I'll haunt them in their sweetest dreams
Screams echo in silence
Lights all around, I feel serenity
But something's hunting me from inside
Hunters and hunted I'm one of them

And so I search the night
To find their evil faces
Ending me in the best part of my life
Will haunt you endlessly

You turned your face from love to evil
Time to see your family

I see the teardrops falling gently down their faces
Our story ended all too soon, oh no
And it's all because of lies

Mother's hand on son, telling life can't always be that easy
I too wish this undone
But we have to get through

See the world from after life, I'm flying
Mystical life!
I have a vision that pierces all lies
I see the puzzle to our life
World in my eyes!
Emotional impact, departure of love
How I crave for revival
To hold my loved ones
And keep them away from the wolves

I keep calling your name in despair
Hoping answers will appear
Tell me, how did we get lost inside this maze?

Five to three
Both the rifles in their position
I go down
Two to three
I have reached my final decision:
I will make the call
When I pick up the lobby phone
My wife appears
She approaches a smiling face

As I gaze upon my love
All the light has made me blind
My angel cries and fights for my life
Memories unfold

I was traveling through great dimensions
While people were gathering around me
The attention was won
But all I had worked for was gone
See the world from after life, I'm flying
Mystical life!
I have a vision that pierces all lies
I see the puzzle to our life
World in my eyes!

Look out the window
Look at the stars
Will you ever find an answer there?
Look at my picture
Look in my eyes
Will you wish upon a star to make me strong?

I search Lou Cypher
Offering souls of evil
For redemption
When I'm back
I need my life

Now with demonic force
I have the face of evil
Agony, with the last breaths of their lives
Has been their destinies

Come back to us
We need you so

That the unreal
Has happened anyway

Looking at their faces

6714,"About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.

“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.

“Why — any statement to give out.”

It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”

It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right. Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the “underground pipe-line to Canada” attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say.

James Gatz — that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career — when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people — his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God — a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that — and he must be about His Father’s business, the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.

For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorbtion he took for granted.

But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing.

An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.

Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid sub-journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little Girls Bay.
To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody — he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.

He was employed in a vague personal capacity — while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.

I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a gray, florid man with a hard, empty face — the pioneer debauchee, who during one phase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.

And it was from Cody that he inherited money — a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.

He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.

It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.

They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.

“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’m delighted that you dropped in.”

As though they cared!

“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.”

He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . I’m sorry——

“Did you have a nice ride?”

“Very good roads around here.”
“I suppose the automobiles——”

“Yeah.”

Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.

“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”

“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering. “So we did. I remember very well.”

“About two weeks ago.”

“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”

“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.

“That so?”

Tom turned to me.

“You live near here, Nick?”

“Next door.”

“That so?”
Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.

“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested. “What do you say?”

“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”

“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think ought to be starting home.”

“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.”

“You come to supper with ME,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both of you.”

This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.

“Come along,” he said—but to her only.

“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”

Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go, and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.

“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.

“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.

Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.

“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.

“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, but I’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute.”

The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.

“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?”

“She says she does want him.”

“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” He frowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”

Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.

“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.” And then to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”

Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door.

Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.

They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.

“These things excite me so,” she whispered.

“If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I’m giving out green——”

“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.

“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvelous——”

“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”

Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.

“We don’t go around very much,” he said. “In fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”

“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.

“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.

“The man bending over her is her director.”

He took them ceremoniously from group to group:

“Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan——” After an instant’s hesitation he added: “the polo player.”

“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”

But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby, for Tom remained “the polo player.” for the rest of the evening.

“I’ve never met so many celebrities!” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”

Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.

“Well, I liked him anyhow.”

“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”

Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In case there’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”

Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” he said. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”

“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.” . . . she looked around after a moment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew that except for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.

We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.

“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”

The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.

“Wha’?”

A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club to-morrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:

“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone.”

“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.

“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’”

“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude. “But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”

“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled Miss Baedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”

“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.

“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your hand shakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”

It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched him stoop to one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.

""I like her,"" said Daisy, ""I think she's lovely.""

But the rest offended her-- and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ""place"" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short-cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand

I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. sometimes a shadow moved agains a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, that rouged and powdered in an invisible glass

“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some big bootlegger?”

“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.

“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.”

“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.

He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.

“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.”

A breeze stirred the gray haze of Daisy’s fur collar.

“At least they’re more interesting than the people we know,” she said with an effort.

“You didn’t look so interested.”

“Well, I was.”

Tom laughed and turned to me.

“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?”

Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.

“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she said suddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”

“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.”

“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drug-stores, a lot of drug-stores. He built them up himself.”

The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.

“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.

Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where THREE O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING, a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.

I stayed late that night, Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest-rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.

“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.

“Of course she did.”

“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”

He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.

“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make her understand.”

“You mean about the dance?”

“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”

He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: ""I never loved you."" After she had obliterated four years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house-just as if it were five years ago

""And she doesn't understand,"" he said. ""She used to be able to understand. We'd sit for hours-""

He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers

""I wouldn't ask too much of her,"" I ventured. ""You can't repeat the past.""

""Can't repeat the past?"" he cried incredulously. ""Why of course you can!""

He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand

""I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before,"" he said, nodding determinedly. ""She'll see.""

He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was.

. . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees-he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.

His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.

Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something-an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.",misc

Each joy thou couldst double, and when there came sorrow
Or pale disappointment to darken my way
What voice was like thine, that could sing of tomorrow
Till forgot in the strain was the grief of today!
But when friends drop around us in life's weary waning
The grief, Queen of Numbers, thou canst not assuage;
Nor the gradual estrangement of those yet remaining
The languor of pain, and the chillness of age

'Twas thou that once taught me, accents bewailing
To sing how a warrior I lay stretch'd on the plain
And a maiden hung o'er him with aid unavailing
And held to his lips the cold goblet in vain ;
As vain thy enchantments, O Queen of wild Numbers
To a bard when the reign of his fancy is o'er
And the quick pulse of feeling in apathy slumbers --
Farewell, then, Enchantress I'll meet thee no more!",pop

Where she just can't stop
Takin' me places I've never been

That she don't even owe me the time

This is no way to be in love
No way, this girl is driving me crazy
No way to be in love but I stay
And there ain't nobody makin' me
Can't sleep at night, no apetite
Which way is up, which way was right
No way to be in love

When I heard you say take the good with the bad
But I'm not sure I know what that means
And I know that it's wrong but I still go along
When she's takin' it all to extreme
When I make it up my mind that I'm not gonna take it
She whispers I love me again

Listen mami, love the way we stick together
Face the weather, down for whatever
I need a girl like you, you make it better
Cause you a dime & a half of pure treasure
Me and you like one with each other
And you and me will equal none without the other
Cause you're the one I call my own
With you I'm home, I'll never leave you lonely
Stuck in the zone, baby girl just the best to me
We ecstasy, and its Y like an X to me
My destiny, wonder what the paint would be
She keep it real, keep it straight with me
Just the way it got to be
You know you mean a lot to me
Got my back ain't no stopping me
I'm just hoping that you know that they could last forever
So we can sit and reminisce about the past together
You're just a down as girl

Since we been together it's been like a dream
Too good to be true, me and you we made a good team
From the day we met I like the way you made me feel
So weak at the knees and baby I'm for real
And I looked at you and you looked at me
I knew right then and there that it was meant to be
The perfect match, you take my breath away
You on my mind all the time, every night & day
I reminisce about all the moments alone
The long talks on the phone, a love of my own
I like the way that you hold me, the way you touch me
The way you share your thoughts means so much to me
You got my love it's yours I won't doubt you
When we're not together I'm thinking about you
So lets do it right so we can both stay true
You got my friendship and heart boy
I'm down for you

You were the hand I'd hold when my days were cold
You meant so much to me when you touched my soul
Thee other half that made me whole
The beginning of a story that's yet to be told
Love the nights when we lay together
Love the way that you helped through the rainy weather
At the rate that its going couldn't get no better
The time that I met you I'ma always remember
No matter what you do and I'ma always be there
I cherish your love and the things that we share
Together you know we a perfect pair
You know that I like it when you all in my hair
I love your eyes, you smile, your stare
I'm knowing what we got together is so rare

You know you'll always have a light in my heart

The Look, of Love, Is in, Your eyes, so I look, I look, oh I look, I look
The Look, of Love, Is in, Your eyes, and I look, I look, yea I look, I look
And you in me in for a good night
This must be what love looks like

[Verse 1]
Only if it’s fine, I’d like a moment of your time
For an attempt to convince your heart’s Spokesman to resign
As a matter of fact this isn’t a letter of acquisition
Or act or mission, I just feel I’m better for that position
Me bringing back that tradition, of opening all your doors
See when your love is my allowance then chivalry in a chore
Don’t mention me with before, cause my tendencies will restore
Dating in this dark world is different when you’re with Thor
And I’m sure, hello could’ve been better for a greeting
But if you like her like a simile you met her for a reason
That’s reason’s to see if your heart’s open, and can I sneak in
So you’ll come home to a house of balloons and think it’s the weekend
I know you're scarred, your guard's protection I salute ya
But It’s hard to see errors in our future
The chapter filled with laughter in ya book has arrived
And I know you’re took by surprise, I see that look in your eyes
[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
See I’ve been campaigning for the chance that you would notice me
So when your heart’s up for grabs, I hope you vote for me
I had to audition, I wanted the part
Been searching for my Patty Mayonnaise so I dug in your heart
In an era where social media’s the new boyfriend I feel like
You’d value the importance of a real like in real life
I admire your class… I come prepared.. I don’t complacent
No truancy, til I fluently speak your love language
That smile deposited to my memory bank
Has me falling for you like Trevor for Hillary Banks
Now you’re my mind’s vacation, the thought of you I resort to
That’s why I ought to, be the plaintiff and court you
You thick as Velma, a cutie too, I’m Scooby Doo if the Snacks free
Tho my beard is Shaggy, I’ll clean up like Fred if you’re Daphne
Cause like Jamie I fancy, the thought of seeing you happy
So I’ll be Martin for Gina until our Seasons finale

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Your former service provider ain’t give it all he got
& now I’m in your reception since his call’s been dropped
One Man's lost is another mans Treasure, you forgot?
I've been digging you for a while, but your Ex marked the spot
Storms hope our Days of future pass, spewing the wind
Amusing, ya  Ex men suggesting you mess with mutants again
Like you’ll rekindle that old flame. We both smirked, he stupid
That nintendo, his old games won’t work, he blew it
See I don’t claim to be Honest, and live with lies to prolong
Cause running game is for Sonic, Tails will only fly for so long
I’ll go on, your ex position ain’t led chapter 2
So of course I’m plotting your climax, I’ve read half of you
And whenever you want the Diddly? I’m Ned Flanders boo
If that junk in ya trunk’s my business, I’m Fred Sanford too
Yea I said that to you, let’s share a magical, fun good night
Then stare at the moon imagining what love looks like

And these streets are full of faces
Everywhere that I go
I might even walk past
Someone that I used to know

And my worn down paths they're cold and they're cracked
And they're all painted grey
Whereas my streets they always stay the same
But I feel this change in me every single day

A change in me every day

Storm clouds surrounding my head
Water pours on my desk
That's why I'm always on edge
Everything ends up dead (Everything ends up dead-dead)
Sunlight in my eyes, can't see through the fog
I wish that I missed when we could still talk
Now it's all amiss, I dismiss the fall
When I reminisce, I tear down the walls
That I built to hide from you
I've been too caught up in making the most of my time with you
I've been alone
See the devotion I covet is flying away with the crows
Nobody knows what you meant
Wasting the time that I spent holding my chest
Losing my breath, but there's not a sеcond that I don't regret
I wish that you matterеd less

Going back on my word 'til I'm laying in the dirt again

Your bloodshot eyes
Just can't look away as you take my life
What once was always passes by
All passions fade into some lies
Sunsets hide in the rocky cliffs
I'm paralyzed, my limbs are stiff
Reflection won't look away from the window
Not quite here or gone, just stuck in limbo
I can’t swim in the freezing waters
Find your heart in an empty coffer
All torn up, like mine
It’s often we find ourselves here
My tears, they always disappear
Your tears, always smear
The paintings that we created together
Constantly feeling just a little bit under the weather

Rain on the windshield, pain that a kid feels
Getting involved and moving on
Going back on my word 'til I'm down on my luck again

I'm been giving music my heart and I will until I'm dead
When they put me in this box with my voice inside their head
They'll remember my name too and the legacy I left
My name is Blindsight, my vision is fading with time
The needle's in my eye, one day I will be completely blind
Like fuck it I'ma keep driving, fuck a crutch
Clutch on my dreams, there's nothing I want more
Nothing that I can't see in the crowd everybody want to stare at me
But when I open my mouth nobody's cares they just glare at me
Like 'cause he's blind I just can't be your friend
Like there's nothing I can do so you stop it before it begins
I swear I don't want this but the stigma is on me
When they see me they pause but they do not acknowledge me
They dodge and keep walking it's obvious they saw me
I'm positive they're watching but they never stop to talk to me, no

I can make it even sightless I believe in my sound
My worth is priceless and I don't need them keeping me down
I won't, a little fish swimming in the swamps with the gators
Got piranha's on my tail trying to slaughter Crusaders
I keep looking forward as the water swallows invaders
I just follow the waves and hope that God be my savior
I am grateful for the people the I have met along the way
Crypt, Hi Rez, Duanetv, Chvse, and Vin Jay
And Upchurch your music has been lifting me upward
All of you have been part of the reason I won't give up, word
Everyone wants to leave their own legacy behind
But not everyone makes it slowly, forgotten memories die
Lost in a matter of time put in a box eternal life
Dust on their stone and not a single rose in sight

Did you accomplish what you wanted, did you make your dreams real?
Did you stop making excuses and start making deals?
Did you ever take a chance? Did you ever the roll the wheel?
Was your life too much of a challenge for you to continue fighting?
Was the booth too big for your voice to cut through all of the silence too quiet
Were you tired of being flat? No spares in the back
Be aware of these facts homie where you at?
I'm right here as a matter of fact
I did, I have an amazing life and I'm proud of my kid
Brightest of minds, I'm making music all of the time
And I changed a bit, never quit, never say I didn't try
I have no regrets to my girls I'ma legend
I'm living in their hearts, only place that's feels like heaven
When I'm old and grey and I take my last breath
There's no questions I lived my life the best that's a blessing (Blindsight, Blindsight)

I would post it
So i am
Once again i'm the youngest
The only one that keeps his word
I wrote u an album
2014 came around
I stopped writing
It got to hard
I gave up
(i gave up)
[Chorus]
SEASONS CHANGING LIKE THE WIND
WERE IT STARTS IS WERE IT ENDS
LIFE WAS BETTER WITH U IN IT
MEMORY'S ARE EVERYTHING
SEASONS CHANGING LIKE THE WIND
WERE IT STARTS IS WERE IT ENDS
LIFE WAS BETTER WITH U IN IT
MEMORY'S ARE EVERYTHING

[verse 2]
Aye
Time flys
I was ten
Time flew by
Now look at me
Its 2018
I'm 15 going on 16
I got a G.F
Now i don't
I lost her
I'm 15 going on 16
Time flys by fast
But it dont matter

[Chorus]
SEASONS CHANGING LIKE THE WIND
WERE IT STARTS IS WERE IT ENDS
LIFE WAS BETTER WITH U IN IT
MEMORY'S ARE EVERYTHING
SEASONS CHANGING LIKE THE WIND
WERE IT STARTS IS WERE IT ENDS
LIFE WAS BETTER WITH U IN IT
MEMORY'S ARE EVERYTHING

[verse 3]
It don't matter
How fast time flys
I will never give up
Its like a race
I won't give up
Evan tho i might be losing
I won't give up
I won't forget him
I still miss him
Its 2018
I'm cleaning my room
Dumped out a box
Found my book
I open it up
I can see the past
All the songs i wrote
I turn the pages
I see his album
Its unfinished
I look
I see my past
I remember the promise i made
(the promise)
That i would finish
Stated editing
Started writing
Wrote six more songs
Started with seven
Now i got 13 songs.time's flying by
Its flying fast
Now i'm waiting
Yes i remember my promise
To find a way to post it
Time is flying by
I know ill see him soon
Time is flying by
Time is flying by so fast
I will see u soon
Untill then
I guess this is goodbye
But i promise u this
I will see u soon
Rest in peace buddy

Freedom burns forever in the holy sun
It leads us into a battle that's never won
Whatever I take
Or whatever I give
Doesn't seem to matter anymore
When there's no

(Chorus) Justice in the world
No justice in the world
You feed the fire when you say it's all over
No justice in the world
When you realize that the devil's got your number
It's your decision
To walk the mile when the road is long
It's like religion wasting our lives on a
Worthless cause
Whatever I take
Or whatever I give
Doesn't seem to matter anymore

Love hangs herself
With the bed sheets in her cell
Threw myself on fires for you
Ten good reasons to stay alive
Ten good reasons that I can't find

Oh, give me a reason to be beautiful
So sick in his body so sick in his soul
Oh, give me one reason to be beautiful

I live my life in ruins for you
And for all your secrets kept
I squashed the blossom and the blossom's dead

Oh, and I will make myself so beautiful

The day that we never see

Dead body on scene can't rise em

Safe I'm on major things
Maid with the faithful brain

Talking shit & taking names
Daily how make it slang

Pray for me

Business oh mind yo own business
I minister mine with the sinners

Being emotional

That's when I fall

Of being wrong
I put it all together
That's when I crawl
Saying things
Praying for change
Seductively hoping
To make him my thrawl
But to look down
Is to say that they've won

I answer the call

Of chess they made
Watch my step
It all works the same
Forfeit my chances
Forfeit my loss
Forfeit my rights
And forfeit my wrongs

I still envision though
When I get done
I reap what I sow
Can't make magic
With things that won't last
Do me a favor
Do what I ask
Simple tasks
For simple people
It can't be that hard
Don't come creeping
Gotta get over
This ache in my heart
Because if I don't
It might tear me apart

Forfeit this game
Of chess they made
Watch my step
It all works the same
Forfeit my chances
Forfeit my loss
Forfeit my right
And forfeit my wrongs
Will you forgive me
For the things I've done
I can't see another way
To get through this
Will you forgive me
For the things I've done
I can't see another way

1283,"On top of spaghetti
All covered with cheese
I lost my poor meatball
When somebody sneezed

It rolled off the table
And on to the floor
And then my poor meatball
Rolled out of the door

It rolled in the garden
And under a bush
And then my poor meatball
Was nothing but mush

The mush was as tasty
As tasty could be
And then the next summer
It grew into a tree

The tree was all covered
All covered with moss
And on it grew meatballs
And tomato sauce
So if you eat spaghetti
All covered with cheese

A moment to reflect
A broken crown bearing down
Upon a weary head
Look in his eyes, you'll see
A lifetime of regret
The signs of stress
The emptiness
The lack of self-respect

Bjorn: I want to ask you something...what is a blood eagle?
Ragnar: The offender gets down on his knees…and his back is opened with knives. And then, with axes, his ribs are chopped away from his spine, and then his lungs are pulled out of these huge bleeding wounds, and laid upon his shoulders so they look like the folded wings of a great eagle

[Verse 1: Bigg Limn]
What you gonna do with a cold-blooded killa on the loose and running at yo grilla
Maybe with a knife, maybe with a gat, only thing you need to know is I'm a mad dome peeler
Is that yo villa? Is that yo home?
Is that where yo wife and your kids is all alone?
Is that where the scene of the gruesome murder was?
Yeah, I raped and murdered and what I screamed on the phone
Man these voices won’t leave me alone
Got me armed and loaded, Ruger put three through my dome
But instead I just take out all of my frustration on the population when I'm in the zone
Only woman that I love is my chrome
And that Mary, gon' never leave ’em alone
Cause they always there for me whenever I need 'em
Never have to beat 'em just to get what I want
And you know I spit that syphilis funk
Give a fuck if you already heard it, get in the trunk
Let's take a ride for a little while, and in a while and it's gonna end with you getting fucked
But you won't be alive for that so don't worry
And when it comes to killing I ain't in no hurry
I’d rather take the time to mind all the details
Killing’s 'em a reset, playing with the organs
All you rappers boring got me storing up in the studio every time I see you bastards recording
And believe me it’s even worse when you and all your homies on stage stumbling around performing
Taking all of these records into the forest to give 'em all a blood eagle
First rip open they back and then chop out the ribs with an axe
Then pull out their lungs leave 'em draped on they shoulders
[Chorus: Bigg Limn]
Ugh, give 'em-give ’em all a blood eagle, eagle
Give 'am all a-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
G-g-g-g-g-g-give 'em all a blood eagle
First rip open they back and then chop out the ribs with an axe
Then pull out their lungs leave 'em draped on they shoulders
Ugh, give 'em-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
Give 'am all a-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
G-g-g-g-g-g-give 'em all a blood eagle
First rip open they back and then chop out the ribs with an axe
Then pull out their lungs, leave 'em draped on they shoulders

[Verse 2: Donnie Menace]
All I do is see people that walk around like they don't wanna live and it's making me wanna start torturing and slaughtering
State to state and continent to continent
Even pregnant women can get it, killing babies like an abortionist
I'm mangling their corpses and I'm playing with the organs and I watch 'em dangle from a tree and hang 'em like an ornament
Kidnapping hookers and strippers and chain 'em inside of my basement
Enslave them and rip 'em when I'm horny bitch (This is Hell's pit)
I'm gonna make you fall in it, skinning your body making a suit and sporting it
Hook in your eye or a sword in your spine, you're a target of mine and when I'm aiming son I hardly miss
I'm not the one you want it with
I love the face when families found
Cannibals stabbed you in and out, then eat you animal style
I'm a vessel for the devil like the end of all doubt
So get to running for your life whenever this man is around
And if I catch your bitch pissing while her panties are down then I'ma fuck her with a knife so she can't have a child
Bitch is screaming for the life, I like to sample the sound
Then make a beat, rap to it and sell the track to my crowd
Dressed like a hipster then run up in Starbucks and start stabbing everybody leaving them all scarred up
It don't matter as long as people are bleeding and dying
I even squeeze the iron at a fucking retard bud
Get your heart cut out then I play with it
Sucking blood out the aorta cause I'm loving the taste of it
Taking crazy to another level while being a fatalist, my brain is sick and I'm not denying and I'm embracing it
I'm sick as Ebola and anxious to give you a blood eagle
Open your back then I'll chop up your ribs with an axe
Then pull out your lungs, leave 'em draped on your shoulders
[Chorus: Bigg Limn]
Ugh, give 'em-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
Give 'am all a-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
G-g-g-g-g-g-give 'em all a blood eagle
First rip open they back and then chop out the ribs with an axe
Then pull out their lungs leave 'em draped on they shoulders
Ugh, give 'em-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
Give 'am all a-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle
G-g-g-g-g-g-give 'em all a blood eagle
First rip open they back and then chop out the ribs with an axe
Then pull out their lungs, leave 'em draped on they shoulders

[Verse 3: Twisted Insane]
Mmm, walk up in the front but I'ma take 'em in the back
Make 'em wish they never woulda diss I'm 'bout to miss so they can bitch about it, I'm still gonna hit them with the MAC
I'm loving, don't wanna be off in the middle of bullshit, I push it to make 'em take a doodoo in their pants and run away
Before I bust and make amends and put your flesh up on a plate
So quit your stressing and be besting, millimeters seal your fate you puny human
Duck cause hollow tips'll be zooming
Past you moving so fast you would think it is fucking shrooming
Fucking bust watch 'em duck, I'ma peel 'em when I be looming
Happen to get away, that's that shit that would get me fuming
Big roof then in a haunted house I feel I'm cooped in
Making sure I'm loaded before I begin to shoot and loose then
Hitting you, might hide before I'm booting
I'm coming around the mountain and I'm 'bout to kick the two in
Fuck it I'ma get my ego bloody and my buddy with me ready to put you up in the dirty when you get funny with me
Got the fifty cal to make you nervous, fuddy duddy with me
Watch your melon if you telling goons you getting money with me
Shit I be creeping like a spider in the darkness
If you looking for some stupid beat bitch I am heartless
Laugh every time these people tell me I'm a roll model with my Olde E bottles scattered on the carpet
I ain't finna stop until these motherfuckers crunch
Time up and superglue his nuts to the bench
What's that, you're screaming? Nigga you're bleeding?
Somebody gotta hurry up and hands me the wrench, I'm a goon
March you motherfuckers to the tomb
Buried them up in the dirt and get away up in a Regal
Evil surrounds me every single day up in my life
I might just pull the knife or better yet the bloody eagle (Eagle)

Ugh, give 'em-give 'em all a blood eagle, eagle

To pave a better route

It can save yours too

Slicing through the forest just make it out alive

Except some fame
I ain't to blame
Never wanna change
No, you wanna stay the same

A lot of people gonna try to steer you in the wrong direction
They gonna try and pass judgement on you about what you should and shouldn't be doing
But at the end of the day, you, yourself can decide that
Take me, for example
I blocked out all the noise, locked myself in my room for a couple years and just look at the goddamn music I'm making now
And that's thanks to myself
So remember, at the end of the day, you can do any of that shit
Follow yo' path, do what the fuck you wanna do
Fuck what everyone else has to say
That's when greats are born

I was living in a run down town in the far east side of the city

Got used to feeling alone, couldn’t feel nothing else then

I was reminiscing of a way back when – time and time again



Luck be on my side, even when swimming against this tide of mine

You can leave me then, never needed any and I’m doing just fine tonight

Thorn in my side, only when I’m running into this storm of mine

You can leave me then, never needed any and I’m doing just fine tonight



Would be nice this time, would be nice if I
I could climb baby I could climb baby I could climb out of this hole of mine



Luck be on my side, be on my side tonight

Could really do with a little good will to get me through the night

The sunshine walks beside her but I can barely see

Tell me baby is it gonna get better when the worry doesn’t follow me



Luck be on my side, even when swimming against this tide of mine

You can leave me then, never needed any and I’m doing just fine tonight

Thorn in my side, only when I’m running into this storm of mine

You can leave me then, never needed any and I’m doing just fine tonight



Would be nice this time, would be nice if I
I could climb baby I could climb baby I could climb out of this hole of mine

For being patient and being faithful to me

People nowadays lookin for a handout
They’d rather have it given than be different and stand out

Wanna ruin the success that everyone is seeing

- ""The seas, they're... they're whispering!""

The black sun rises over the northern sky
Our prow breaks the ice before us
The sea below lies stagnant, its foetid breath the air of dead men

Their eyes stare up at us, pleading to join them
The icy grave melts under the foul mist, poisoned wind from the east
The final judgment of dead races past

Ravens bite at their flesh, and spit it back out into the mire
To join their parasitic host again

Worse fates await those who defile their blood and honour
Look to the farthest northern shores
Beyond Cronia, beyond the sea, beyond your dreams
To the frozen throne, where he awaits

""And they passed the Scythian archers, and the Tauri who eat men
And the wandering Hyperboreai, who feed their flocks beneath the pole-star
Until they came into the northern ocean, the dull dead Cronian Sea.""

5228,"Here's my love song, I know it won't seem long
So what do you want, a great big story
With lots of pretty phrases and accolades and praises
Well here it is in all of its glory

When you say you love me I'm sitting on the top of the world
There's nothing above me sitting on the top of the world

Passing my time trying to find a rhyme
That says it all like it's never been before
Pushing my pen round's bringing my head down

(Las plagas de la mente
Yo soy a quien temes, ha ha ha)
They call me Sherlock Bones
Hellhound for the devil's throne, uh!
I’ll kill every last one of you
If it means I get to feel something
Hail to the king

[Verse 1]
Hell walks this earth
And it dwells beneath my skin
Born of a dying mother and violent father
I'll do my best to snuff out your existence
I was there when the rain fell
When the reaper screamed fear me
And helped him out as well
That boy did well, but I could've done better
So if you hear me coming
Don't run, you won't get far
[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what it's like, tell me what it’s like
Tell me what it's like being me, motherfucker

[Chorus]
It’s like kicking rocks in the yard with intentions to harm
If death's on your heels, you won't get far
The devil's on my back
The target's on my head
Humanity's on my chest constricting my breath
Disdain, with a foul taste
Noose as a necklace
I can't praise God while keeping a straight face
Laughing away at his fucking mistakes
I'm not psychopathic
Just a little misanthropic

[Post-Chorus]
Narcissistic to the bone

[Verse 2]
So crawl, crawl on your knees
Beg for forgiveness
For all your dirty deeds
And your dirty needs
On your dirty knees
In this house of wolves, no one hears your pleas
No one talks, not even Jay says hi
Just because he never got to kiss his lover goodbye, huh
Just 'cause I was the one that kicked out her chair
It was funny watching her dangle though, gasping for air
Well, this whole shit show is ruled by an iron fist
I’m not surprised that dick made a hit list

[Chorus]
He kicks rocks in the yard with the intentions to harm
If I'm on your heels, you won't get too far
The devil's on my back
The target's on my head
Humanity's on my chest constricting my breath
Disdain, with a foul taste
Noose as a necklace
I can't praise what's not really there with a straight face
Doctor please, don't mishear me
I'm not misogynistic
Just a little misanthropic

[Verse 3]
I was left outside the devil's gates
So I overthrew him, and now the demons bow to me
Not even God will save me now
Don't you know
(God abandoned me)
[Pre-Breakdown]
Each case comes another kill
47 down, 47 to go

[Breakdown]
Bow, bow, bow down
I'm a bag of bones
For the bad Luck hellhounds
Iron cuffs, slapped on your wrist tight
Spit blood, standing on your windpipe
I'm that guy that brings a knife to a gunfight and wins
(Only evil within, like a knife blade under the skin)

[Verse 4]
A kill a day keeps the demons at bay
But what happens when the only demon left is me?
Choir, tell me, tell me, tell me
Fucking tell me

[Bridge / Chorus]
Burning down your yard with intentions to harm
If he's on your heels, you won't get too far
The devil's on your back
The target's on your head
Humanity's on your chest constricting your breath
Disdain, with a foul taste
Noose as a necklace
You can't praise God with the devil in front of your face
Laughing away at all your mistakes
I'm not psychopathic
I just don’t give a fuck what you think

Fuck you

555,"Carlos Zaragoza left his home in Casas Grandes when the moon was full
No money in his pocket, just a locket of his sister framed in gold
He rode into El Sueco, stole a rooster called ""Gallo del Cielo""
Then he crossed the Rio Grande with that rooster nestled deep beneath his arm

Well, Gallo del Cielo was a warrior born in heaven, so the legends say
His wings they had been broken, he had one eye rollin' crazy in his head
And He'd fought a hundred fights, but the legends say that one night near El Sueco
They'd fought Cielo seven times and seven times he'd left brave roosters dead

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars and the good luck of your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo del Cielo
And Then I'll return to buy the land that Villa stole from father long ago

Outside of San Diego in the onion fields of Paco Monteverde
The Pride of San Diego lay sleeping on his fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Zaragoza pulled the one-eyed del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Zaragoza walked away with a thousand dollar bill

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Barbara
I have fifteen hundred dollars and the good luck of your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all on the fighting spurs of Gallo del Cielo
And then I'll return to buy the land that Villa stole from father long ago
Now the moon has gone to hiding and the lantern light spills shadows on the fighting sand
Where a wicked black named Zorro faces Gallo del Cielo in the night
But Carlos Zaragoza fears the tiny crack that runs across his rooster's beak
And he fears he has lost the fifty thousand dollars riding on the fight

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in Santa Clara
Yes, the money's on the table, I'm holding to your good luck framed in gold
And everything we dreamed of is riding on spurs of del Cielo
I pray that I'll return to buy the land that Villa stole from father long ago

Then the signal it was given, and the roosters rose together far above the sand
Then Gallo del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly but they rose and fought each other thirty seven times
And the legends say that everyone agreed del Cielo fought the best

Then the screams of Zaragoza filled the night outside the town of Santa Clara
As the beak of del Cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Zaragoza screamed a curse upon the bones of Pancho Villa
When Zorro rose up one last time and drove del Cielo to the sand

Hola, my Theresa, I am thinking of you now in San Francisco
There is no money in my pocket, I no longer have your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening with the bones of my beloved del Cielo
And I'll not return to buy the land that Villa stole from father long ago

Do the rivers still run muddy outside of my beloved Casas Grandes?
And does the scar upon my brother's face turn red when he hears mention of my name?
Do the people of El Sueco curse the theft of Gallo del Cielo?
Well tell my family not to worry, I will not return to cause them shame",country

But how can they know 'bout love thats truth
They've never been in love with you
The clocks ticking on the wall
I fear you won't come home at all
But I stay waiting by your door
I just want more and more and more

The only thing that I ever wanna do
Is to get strung out over you
No there is nothing in the world
I'd rather do than stay strung out over you
My heart's a blaze I'm in a mist
I've never been in love like this
Your presence liquid like the sea
Embracing me eternally
So please take some time to face the truth
I am so strung out over you

Baby don't disregard the fact
You'll always see me running back

Keeps me strung out over you

1109,"Blue neon clock fingers sneaking past the stars
Extinguish the last fuse of day
Through black rain-wet streets rush bleary-eyed cars
Stuffed with revellers drunk and blasé

In Soho stained waiters bang dustbins around
Commissionaires yawn into tweed
As empty and echo hose yesterday down
The night people slide inbetween

Sallow dudes with spotlight eyes
Pour laughter sauce on ice
Velvet dolls with brandied smiles
Lean close with mouths of dice
The tunnel band plays studded drums
And spits electric spears
As the dancers kick like marionettes
Through the smokescreen atmospheres
Dance on pale harlequins of night
Lest you scratch your gilded fears
The paint peeling tea stall by Charing Cross bridge
Attracts lonely moths to its lamps
In corners of archways on a benches oak ridge
Lie newspapered wine-softened tramps;
Pushed on by policemen and queueing for soup
Evading the world's outstretched glove
But one pain they share with the jewelled ghost troupe
Both searching for some kind of love

Gargoyles chewing on dead cigars
Stack chips in crystal halls
Sequinned starlets scent their breasts
Till the single finger calls
Rhinestoned strippers strut and peel
For the cochineal stockade
The gangster roars his crew applauds
At the punter's fun parade;
All worshiping the jaws of night
Where the piper is never paid
Champagned freaks in denim shirts
Snort energy in spoons
Laughing girls ask zodiac signs
But their eyes sing lonely tunes
It's four o'clock the wine is flat
The coffee has long gone cold
The rustlers pay their last respects
Then drive away blindfold…
Dead the hollow dreams of night
Turn grey dissolve… dissolve…

Leaves dervish dance on the coiled wind of dawn
Whisper… The curtain lifts… Day
News vans and lorries with oranges roar
From Fleet Street to Ealing Broadway
The first bus with charladies stops in the Strand
Milk vans and post vans cruise by
At Euston commuters, shop girls and striped suiters
Are jostling and milling, cars hooting, brakes shrilling…",rock

Under stark Montana skies

In our small-time college town

What a campus clown
His jokes hid deep rivers
That bubbled far below
And he rode the current west
Where the rapid waters flow

And share the balmy freedom
Of San Francisco nights

Well you know that that's unfair
She said I wasn't there for her
Well I never would have been there, no sir

Summer comes around
And I miss that woman more
I guess I'll get me somewhere by the fall
When the rain comes
Well I'll just let it pour

I'm a hurting kind of guy
Why'd that woman leave me for a lesser kind
If you don't know now, then you never will

Almost got through the door but they put it on latch

If I follow that nigga it'll be to his house
Cock back my ting, put it in his mouth
Look him in his eyes, nigga talk tough now

1824,"Are they smiling as their fabrics of death are received?
Do they welcome our apathy?
Are we feeding on their violence as we borrow our voice
To a consented tyranny?

Every step from here is a step too far but it's far enough to ignore
Have we already made our peace with the furious forces of war?

Export, expand, accelerate, exteriorate the collapse
We accept that they kill the distant innocent in our place
There's nothing you can see here that's not payed for in blood
Are we blinded or are we ashamed to face the utter disgrace?

We are the beating heart in the body of the monster
We are the inertia at the center of the confounded eye of the storm
We are the blind spot in a pastiche of destruction
As long as we stay silent for nobody there will be calm
There is no place we are given to elude the fingers of corruption

Chaos is not caused by subversion
It is a force from above
Terror is not the path of rebellion
It is a function of domination
Domination

Terror is a measure of maintenance
Why don't we see that this system is fouling from the inside out?
It's hollow yet, the fraud is getting old
This is the land where peace is bought and war is sold

Hostage

Hostage to the empire
We believe we are alive
But we are hostage to the walking dead

We are the beating heart in the body of the monster
Hopelessness is sold as privilege of the rich
Our cynicism is our daily bread
We believe we are alive
But we are hostage to the walking dead
Life is bought and death is sold

We are the beating heart in the body of the monster
We are the inertia at the center of the confounded eye of the storm

Every step from here is a step too far
Have we already made our peace
With the forces of war?

Hostage to the empire

Trapped in hyperspace
Motionless we stay

Still, we climb these ceilings, walls, and trees
And we can't stop clinging on our knees

Dreaming of green skies
Burning with hindsight
Eerie with mean eyes
Solice the moontide
This doesn't feel nice
Burns like the light

On this goodnight

Frozen in a lake
Mystic covered space
All true thoughts erased
This will soon be over, old and new
You're the four leaf clover that guides me through

Look at this new size
Gross and divine
Now I finally realise
All that is mine
So we'll keep on breeding this huge woe
Because our wounds quit healing long ago

Now you sit on your throne

Hesitate to change the station

The years pass by
The stitches plucked from all the seams

The constant panic makes me feel awake

Hey

[Verse 1]
You would think I’m an early riser
The way that you see me up in the morning
Truth is I ain’t slept
I try have an early night but nah I gotta deal with demons calling
In my brain at war
I can’t be falling short cause that’s not my calling
Yawning when I see fake yutes spawning
Come for more than a portion
My minds parked off, ain’t linking dots and my skin keeps crawling
Bass make you shake like ketamine
I need loot, I run to the chest like Bennington
Long live
This flow is appalling
Forcing the door, I’m getting in
Me and the game ain’t on no chalk and cheddar thing
Made for this shit like andrex, wipe that grin off your face mans peppеring
Any song, any genre, anything
Ain’t tryna mess with thеm kids, they’re meddling
I call man out and they act like they ain’t got a Scooby don’t say anything
You’re pussy, it’s evident
My posse, we get it in
Get you lit like adrenaline
Ay ay
[Chorus]
Where did the time go?
Live life on a tightrope
I watch time pass by in the sky
Bro, birds eye view got a eye full of them
Man tower above this is my world
These grey clouds going where I go
Don’t pree it cause I don’t
I’m always up for the dates like iPhones
Rocking the stage like psycho
Vital vital
Thrilling and feeling like Michael
American Idol
Peppering rivals
Set going viral
You see the smoke clouds from my arrival
Swear life is a vicious cycle
Head spinning like vinyl
Primal mind, I’m seeing the light on the dial
Gimme my title

[Verse 2]
I should take my own advice
Stuck in a loop
I heard they’re wanting the truth
Motivation get gone when there’s nothing to do
Still man are up ’til stupid o’clock in booth
Send the stems up at quarter to
Get my shit mobile, that’s portaloo
Get the munchies order food
Jump barriers at Waterloo
Mans more than crude
Don't know who you think you’re talking to
For a piece of the pie pitchforking youths
If I die, come back from the dead then haunt them yutes
And true say next year, we outsource man already out sauce these yutes
Check
Fuck anybody who hated the kid
Fuck you if you ain’t believe in my art
I came from the dirt
My brudda I got heart
Grind from the mud with the gang work hard
They said that I’m taking a risk with Go Yard
I said fuck that shit, I’m an artist
Yo
Lemme just lay my craft
My teas gone cold, my joints gone out
Fuck this life, I just want out
I don’t want die, I won’t lay down
I got my team, I hold it down
Look
Fuck laying down for a next man
Tryna get my head around the next scam
And without the music, I’m a dead man
So I’m gonna do it ’til I’m dead fam, test man
[Chorus]
Where did the time go?
Live life on a tightrope
I watch time pass by in the sky
Bro, birds eye view got a eye full of them
Man tower above this is my world
These grey clouds going where I go
Don’t pree it cause I don’t

I was racing in line now I'm pacing the climb

Baby, life could be sublime but you still wait in line
You're still waiting to shine
You're still biding your time
Been lookin in between but I've been living in extremes
I've been ripping all the seams
Never stuck inside a box but I've been stuck in my routines
I been stayin' out the scene
I been lost inside a dream
Been traveling my mind, more lucid than the world seems

A humble man breaks when he can't make certain guarantees
Selling rock on the block got him locked up for life

Ever since I was about yea high
I always wanted to go-
I always wanted to go to the town of Hollywood
Just so I could see all the motion picture stars
Up close in person, huh?
And I'm sure if everybody in the audience
Wanted to be real honest
Well, you'd admit that at one time in your lives
You kinda really wanted to do the same thing
So if I may
I'd actually like to take you on an imaginary trip
With a fella who comes from, uh
From a small town in the States

[verse 1: mr. master]
The day started like any other
With the sound of tires screeching and metal folding
Cars always crash at this intersection
Accidents always happen
Something you can't ever forget in this line of work
Everything was business as usual
Until I saw that twinkle in the boss's eyes when I walked in
“You are one lucky man,” he says
Reaches in his left drawer, pulls out a picture frame
And puts it on the desk, it's me
My official portrait
The one they hang on the wall
So the new guys know who not to fuck with
Eight years of wiping blood off my hands
And I'm that close to finally calling the shots around here
But it's never that easy

He reaches in his right drawer, takes out a second frame
My wife. My kids
I don't remember taking this picture
He says, “Luck will only get you so far,” and stands up
Walks toward me, eyes locked on mine

He says “You have until Friday
By then, only one of us will have this job
And if you want it to be you
You're going to have to take it from me.”
And he shoves me out the door
One guy, one job, only one way to make sure
Let the games begin

3:42 in the morning
I’ve been staring at the world through my sniper’s sights
For the past five hours, waiting
Staring at the world
The whole world in my hands
Just a flick of the finger, a pull of this trigger away
From the whole entire world…
Staring at the world through his apartment window, waiting
For that dot to land
On the head of that body
On that obstacle in my way
This whole organization won’t know what hit it
Sitting, staring, headlights, he’s here
Staring, waiting. His head, trigger, bang
Hero

Imagine an irresistible force encounters an immovable object
Equal magnitude, exact opposite directions. Imagine the result

The thoughts ricocheted around my brain
The glory, the responsibility
The inhumanity, the savagery. The ceaselessness
The cycle
The success
The position was mine and I asked for everything that came with it
Speeding down the highway
With all the confidence of a newly crowned king
Until
That all too familiar sound

That's the trouble with this town of Hollywood

Give me a kiss to build a dream on
And my imagination
Will thrive upon that kiss
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this
A kiss to build a dream on

Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
Will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on

When I'm alone with my fancies
I'll be with you
Weaving romances
Making believe they're true

Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination
Will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on
[Chorus]
Give me a kiss before you leave me
And my imagination
Will feed my hungry heart
Leave me one thing before we part
A kiss to build a dream on

When I'm alone with my fancies
I'll be with you
Weaving romances
Making believe they're true

Oh, give me your lips for just a moment
And my imagination
Will make that moment live
Give me what you alone can give
A kiss to build a dream on",pop

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green

Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long

6591,"Science! thou fair effusive ray
From the great source of mental day,
Free, generous, and refin'd!
Descend with all thy treasures fraught,
Illumine each bewilder'd thought,
And bless my lab'ring mind.

But first with thy resistless light,
Disperse those phantoms from my sight,
Those mimic shades of thee;
The scholiast's learning, sophist's cant,
The visionary bigot's rant,
The monk's philosophy.

O! let thy powerful charms impart
The patient head, the candid heart,
Devoted to thy sway;
Which no weak passions e'er mislead,
Which still with dauntless steps proceed
Where Reason points the way.
Give me to learn each secret cause;
Let number's, figure's, motion's laws
Reveal'd before me stand;
These to great Nature's scenes apply,
And round the globe, and thro' the sky,
Disclose her working hand.

Next, to thy nobler search resign'd,
The busy, restless, human mind
Thro' ev'ry maze pursue;
Detect Perception where it lies,
Catch the ideas as they rise,
And all their changes view.

Say from what simple springs began
The vast, ambitious thoughts of man,
Which range beyond control;
Which seek Eternity to trace,
Dive thro' th' infinity of space,
And strain to grasp the whole.

Her secret stores let Memory tell,
Bid Fancy quit her fairy cell,
In all her colours drest;
While prompt her sallies to control,
Reason, the judge, recalls the soul
To Truth's severest test.
Then launch thro' Being's wide extent;
Let the fair scale, with just ascent,
And cautious steps, be trod;
And from the dead, corporeal mass,
Thro' each progressive order pass
To Instinct, Reason, God.

There, Science! veil thy daring eye;
Nor dive too deep, nor soar too high,
In that divine abyss;
To Faith content thy beams to lend,
Her hopes t' assure, her steps befriend,
And light her way to bliss.

Then downwards take thy flight agen;
Mix with the policies of men,
And social nature's ties:
The plan, the genius of each state,
Its interest and its pow'rs relate,
Its fortunes and its rise.

Thro' private life pursue thy course,
Trace every action to its source,
And means and motives weigh:
Put tempers, passions in the scale,
Mark what degrees in each prevail,
And fix the doubtful sway.
That last, best effort of thy skill,
To form the life, and rule the will,
Propitious pow'r! impart:
Teach me to cool my passion's fires,
Make me the judge of my desires,
The master of my heart.

Raise me above the vulgar's breath,
Pursuit of fortune, fear of death,
And all in life that's mean.
Still true to reason be my plan,
Still let my action speak the man,
Thro' every various scene.

Hail! queen of manners, light of truth;
Hail! charm of age, and guide of youth;
Sweet refuge of distress:
In business, thou! exact, polite;
Thou giv'st Retirement its delight,
Prosperity its grace.

Of wealth, pow'r, freedom, thou! the cause;
Foundress of order, cities, laws,
Of arts inventress, thou!
Without thee what were human kind?
How vast their wants, their thoughts how blind!
Their joys how mean! how few!

Sun of the soul! thy beams unveil!
Let others spread the daring sail,
On Fortune's faithless sea;
While undeluded, happier I
From the vain tumult timely fly,
And sit in peace with thee.",misc

9,"[Verse 1: Hons]
Check it out
I've been busy this year, in my room mining bitcoins
To repair the ship so I can pilot through this shitstorm
Overplayed like top pair with decent kicker
I'm just trying to double up so I can buy some decent liquor
Sick with a pen like a hentai animator
Only difference is you ain't fapping later
Now the crew back together, lay it down for the posse cut
We make noise while you back up like lorry trucks (Beep beep)
Safe to say no stopping us
We stand tall poppy while they looking for a crop to dust
He's in the Oars, right? (RIGHT) Yeah, that poor guy
Local on a Saturday crying into form guides
Body hates me, problems in my back again
It feels like it went through the damn car crash again
Call me 'Farmer Hons', I'm in the parking lot
Scavenging for coins to fill a script for my barkin' dog

[Verse 2: Briggs]
Yeah, I slept, I never left, ya felt abandoned
So I’m back with a gang of cannons, Afghanistan 'em
Wiped the floorboards with war lords
I'm carpet-bombing any problem and going at the world tour
Certifiable hand up on the bible
Stand up in the churches man there'd be a fireball
It's the maniacal and I'm going Michael
Buble, Bolton, J Fox, I am so
Effortless I'm effin this, I'm everything they ever wished
I get it off technically, like messing with the evidence
Divine intervention, the messenger was heaven sent
Burning anythin', getting next to me like effigies
Torture connoisseur, not afraid to water board
Get your head down like walking out the porno store
S'all the same if you're in the game or on the force
Golden Era gonna run a train like ""All aboard!""

""Everything around me"" ""[?] yeah""
""In case you didn't know""
""No matter the weather you'll find me out doin' whatever""
""Everything around me"" ""[?] yeah""

""Set it off, get it off, let it off""

[Verse 3: Trials]
I gotta make sure they get it right
Trials got them leaving in a stretcher like
Petrified, running fucking low on their electrolytes
I bring it hardcore, like slipping in parkour
And got them all convinced that what I'm doing is an art form
(Word) That's an everyday Oars thing
So many people stuck to the pipe that it's exhausting
Got you shovel in the rubble trying to bury facts
Till I'm back, then you're sucking on the urinary tract
Nice try, wanna help me to rhyme
But with that new fancy watch you couldn't tell me the time
(You'd better check in) I'm the boss figure last level
Turn your wines into weeds, flower petal into sharp metal
Had to settle myself from getting drunk
When they told me life is short, but it's the longest thing I've ever done
(SON) Standing like you're holding handlebars
You can get your car keyed while I'm wearing camouflage
[Verse 4: Vents]
Cynical since the prenatal, every birth is painful
Each breath I take is a gift be grateful
Trying to find a female who'll stay faithful
Know how to cook, look good and stay stable
Living like a 8-ball, strapped to my naval
Sniffing up a plateful of rack up my nasal
Awful enough to kill a mere mortal
People get high so we can feel normal
I'm real thoughtful, my mind move a million
Miles every minute, I blame the reptilian
Brain that's killing the pain with aggression
Love is the answer, hate is the question
Fuck all the drama, just like my father
Try, but you'll never find a chink in my armour
Been through the karma and came out harder
Open my mouth and it rain out lava

Cheah, ayy
Wanna step? Make it worth my effort, I got a
Perfect record of making all these perfect records
Best yet to hold the mic
Drop science on meth heads: Walter White
Assault the mic, we rule the court
You get expelled from my school of thought (This is it)
Ayy, read my palm, leads to the middle finger
Rhymes lead to the middle of the sphincter (I'm the shit)
You sound like Chewbacca screwin' two fat goats
With a mouth full of chewing tobacco *Chewbacca vocalisation*
You sound like you're beating your palm
While I'm the pack leader: Cesar Millan (Tsch tsch)
When me and P in the booth
We don't plagiarise like Shia Lebouf
And these beats are like coal whenever we be rhymin'
We put 'em under Pressure and he turns 'em into diamonds

[Verse 6: Pressure]
I smash tracks like freight trains collide
Unbreakable maintain a mic
Brave take a ride, vacate your mind
I dunno how a single brainwave survives
Got suitcases, train stations, flights
With this family spending my vacation high
It's painstaking and may take your life
Kurt Cobain say today it's a great day to die, uh
Where the track that the bass shake the jive
Don't skip a beat I'm the pace making type
(P be good) While my mates save the tribe
But they say a tiger ain't change its stripes
Wanna break in the game wait your time
Don't get desperate, giving off date raping vibes
You a sheep in the light, the place ain't finite
I'm the beast to the right at the great Satan's side

Check
It's K, I get away with murder a massacre like September
Cannibals aren't this famished, a rapping this when I enter
Wrecker, left the sector flatter than a placenta
Avenger, set to destroy more when I vent, mo'—
Fucker, it's Aussie rap expecting more then a barbie
Or an opinion from me, unless its forced into your ass cheeks
I'm as nasty as Nas be, hurling tsunamis
At your personal army, with a sweet burn like some sake
Picture me trollin like Dolan, putting work in like a sparky
Holding a spliff rolled till I light up the house like a Griswold
Cookie crumble and take your milk and your Monte Carlos
Shoot rappers down like rabbits, frankly, you're a bit Donnie Darko
So I wouldn't give you a stinking bucket of piss
To put you out if you're on fire and think your fuckin' with this
Never learn stop, till I earn stock to buy out Murdoch
While the earth rots and let a jerk flop when he turns [pop]

[Verse 8: Sesta]
Peep the baddest, I trimmed the fat off of each rapper
Single-handedly defeated famine
You can thank me later hater, feeling forsaked and violated
Gimme two shakes I will annihilate 'em
See, my crew has two Dans, two Matts two Adams
One Baz, Adfu and that's Joe a loose cannon
Plus my brother 21 who refused to defuse the bomb
Buddy hose your blood outta the gutter
(WHAT IT LOOK LIKE!)
I'm feelin' about as reasonable as Pac was
Slap your hat backwards, feel it in your chakras
Should have read the fact bruz and you would have seen
The fact that I can ruin a scene like bad actors

First eating ravioli in my ninety dollar white shirt
With my holier than thou frown
Putting it down, now they found dead, holla",rap

I don't wear ice, but I hit a Wayne Gretzky groove
Mixing up the juice, they be watching how I move
How I pop a pen and paper trying to copy what I do
Praying that I lose
Now I'm swerving out the groove
I've been working for a minute, promise this ain't nothing new
I don't ever focus on the past
Got these haters in my dms and they saying this and that
I'm just sipping out the glass, am reading for a laugh
I can't let it slow me down, hella busy with the craft
Got my windows all black, never see me when I pass
When I quit my nine to five, now my life's a fucking blast
Got these ladies shaking ass, with my music in the back
Going zero to a hundred how the hell I never crash

Checking off goals, but it's still never feels right
Life on the road swerve past all the real lights
I don't need breaks, I just switched it in gear like, (skurrt)
I celebrate the drive tourette with number five
I've been feeling more alive
Money doubling his size, she got trouble in her eyes and it got me hypothesized
I can tell she down the rise, so we hit the nine to five
Had to step back fuck where the checks at
Living at my worst, just to find out what I'm best at
Had a minor setback, now they want the quest pass
Working while they party, no they never would invest that, (never)
Turn it up till they notice
I'm never losing the focus
I swear this year's been the coldest
I use the music to cope with all of the stress and the worry and all the people that hurt me
I'm waking up hella early, just to get rich in a hurry
And that mission never wasting any minutes
Y'all been telling me it's fiction
I'm just showing my depiction
Used to hate but now they switch and really do this for a living
Making friends with competition
Building something from a kid a buddy vision

Pets dont know they're your pets
They spend their whole lives confined to those houses, they've got nothing to compare it with

Hipsters don't know that they're hipsters
Bad guys don't think that they're bad
People don't know that they're teaching eachother
To want only what they can't have

So what don't I know that I am?
What don't you know that you are
I feel like driving, all night with my brother
In a car that doesn't know it's a car

And the sun doesn't know it sustains us
And the clock doesn't know it's on time
So every 29th of february, every four years
Somehow it doesn't feel like much in our minds
But this song doesn't know that its empty
And this room doesn't know its a sign
And people keep driftin' in and out of my life
They don't even know that its wrong
Only a fool speaks in absolutes
They never know that they are
What if tonight we just all cleansed ourselves
In stars that don't know that they're stars
Cause what if it's really that easy?
We only think that we know that it's hard",pop

Believing it would be different when you probably would've lost her anyway
You never stood a chance but I know you’re way past convincing
'Cause she gave you hope once didn't she?

On her couch, In a bar in New York City
And the crowd just stopped for broadway
She fell into step with you

It’s pretty simple just an honest decision
We usually found all you ever want is missing
We could do this, say ""I love you""

We're still young and we're still learning lessons
I still act like I'm the baby that's just something that I'm stuck with
If you think so say ""I love you""
Say ""I love you""

You lose yourself unless you choose to loosen up pretty quick
Just hope she comes around but know that she was never yours to begin with
It only took a glance for every firewall to break down
Maybe you'd learn it's a good sign by now
At her house, on the phone it’s just as scary
For the hundreth thousandth time
She falls into step with you

It’s pretty simple just an honest decision
We usually found all you ever want is missing
If you do then say ""I love you""

We're still young and we’re still learning lessons
I still act like I'm the baby that's just something that I'm stuck with
If you think so say ""I love you""
Say ""I love you""
Say ""I love you""

Can you both try to do our best to keep this
Just how it is and do our best to act like no one sees it
And just know I know I love you",pop

Hammering my brain at paces, up n under with em
Stress is eating at my wisdom, what u fathom at?
Might just have a stroke and pass n live in endless black

Take me somewhere away where i'll lose this start
BB cuz so much of humanity is spreading far
Contradictions felt on edge, on end, begin to scar
And u end up in your hole like another oilless spark

Somehow all of us act so fucking ""civilized""
Hate to burst it, revolution will be televised
First thing to it, god is pushing blades into your eyes
Leave ya shit unrecognizable for my despise

Just leave that shit alone

Sippin on the chlorine, shit-cleaned, bullshit

With the stars strung for a rattle;
I cut my teeth as the black racoon--
For implements of battle.
Some are swaddled in silk and down,
And heralded by a star;
They swathed my limbs in a sackcloth gown
On a night that was black as tar.
For some, godfather and goddame
The opulent fairies be;
Dame Poverty gave me my name,
And Pain godfathered me.
For I was born on Saturday--
""Bad time for planting a seed,""
Was all my father had to say,
And, ""One mouth more to feed.""
Death cut the strings that gave me life,
And handed me to Sorrow,
The only kind of middle wife

And she remembers
Grey days – skies of cloud and thunder
It's beautiful to her

Do you ever wanna see it in someone
Or feel it somewhere?
Just a glimpse of an unfettered moment

But no matter what you just gotta keep going
So i wanna thank you for joining me on this journey
It's Ill Motion

[Verse 1]

Raise your fists for the heavily departed
I just wanna live and get through life untarnished
Debut release now i'm just getting started
See im the artist let me show you what my art is

Call it catharsis, I'm no longer dormant
Larger than life i wanna live mine enourmous
I saw this in my dream in pursuit of the cream
I do this for my squad, entourage the whole team now

Never forget where i come from, i rep the city of Bruma and thats the 0121
Cuz growing up we never had much
I remember window shopping we could look but can't touch
Mom's did the best for me and the family played both roles so we could all just live happily
With no role model, no pops to follow
Everyday im hearing mum wish to win the lotto

A real brother trying to make his own way making music for a living trying to earn that motherfuckin' pay
First i was broke but now i got alot, almost lost all hope man life was feeling like a slope

I won't lie things were not sugar coated who ain't had a hard life mine weren't full of roses
But i suppose one door closes another one opens bare witness the path that i've chosen

Fuck where your at it's about where your going
The key is to elevate your mind and keep growing
See i can do this till the day that i collapse
On my grown up shit avoiding all the traps

As the rhapsody unfolds I can't live my life with a story untold that's why i'm going for gold
Everybodys got the strength to be a winner, i stay iller than your common cold, please hold

And take a second to think, if you dont act now life will pass you in a blink
I'm the missing link, that's real
The fact is you lack practice computer codes can't even crack this

I'm unsigned and fully independent
Never pretending cuz i'm living in the present
Im not trying to be stuck in the same place
Im steady making movements, steady trying to elevate
Cuz i'm going for mine before it's too late
I give God thanks for putting food on my plate
Recognize my Ill Motion now that i've spoken
I fear nothing, I live life like it's golden",rap

Candles are burning, my mind returning
From hell
Thoughts are out, I go off route
Into my shell, oh

Yesterday all felt great, now I'm back
Circling around, falling down
This is my fate, oh

I thought I could be better
Could say whatever
But I'm still here, scared, anxiety creeping out
Stuck, honestly still freaking out
Stripes down my face
I can't move from my place
Laughs are echoing in my head

Diss the dismay, release the bliss
I know what I'm supposed to do

Take another swig
One for every promise I renege
Everything is my fault
Though I know it's not

Can't believe I just sat
Can't believe I just left like that
What is this?
Things I never wanted to miss

I thought I could be better
Thought I could say whatever
But I'm still here, scared, anxiety creeping out
Stuck, honestly still freaking out
All of these people feel foreign
I'm neither sinking nor soaring
I'm either joking or boring

Free the sun, feel the fun
I know what I'm supposed to do
Diss the dismay, release the bliss

So many things, they just think you forgot
Who you are, and what you do, and where you're coming from

No bad body language can start to rub off
Till we're choosing weapons and hatred, not love

Everything they said that I couldn't be
Everything that I said I would be, when I picked up a pen and I started to speak

I just poured all of my heart in these sheets
I could not just be a star in the street
Man, I knew I was different, I had the belief
Nowhere to live, nothing to eat
You were so hungry that you couldn't sleep
You couldn't breathe, how could it be
All of this shit was happening to me?
I would do drugs, I was a thief
Still on the run from the karma police
You were the mission that's given to me
By the powers that be minus Devil, G-O-D

Earth stood hard as iron
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen
Snow on snow

May have gathered there
Cherubim and Seraphim
Thronged the air;

In her maiden bliss
Worshiped the Beloved
With a kiss

Oh, What can I give Him
Poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd
Would I bring a lamb?
If I were a wise man
Would I do my part
Yet what I can I give Him -
Give my heart

Thanksgiving at the prison, surrounded by families
Road weary pilgrims who show up faithfully
Sometimes love ain easy, sometimes love ain free

My grammy looks so old now, her hair is soft and white like the snow
Her hands tremble when they frisk her from head to her toes
They make her take her winter coat off then they frisk her again

Everyon'es Been Hurtin' in these times
But it's like I've been Doin' Fine
I've been prepared for these times took the time to read the signs
So now I'm Coastin'
While people's false sense of security, shatters and crumbles
It Humbles, welcome to reality
You weren't worried about me and mine, so fuck you and yours
Commit suicide while I slide in a Six Four
Plus it's JFK, I mean the brains blown out, sayin' the top goes down
God makes the world Go 'round
Got plenty room to hustle Haters evaporate and keep hatin'
While I go my way I'll be minding mine and marinatin'
That's right, I'm buttered and sauced, I'm from the land of the lost
I heavily floss and honeys get tossed
And I ain't gotta lie, and I ain't gotta try
And I ain't gotta do a lot because I'm naturally fly
I'm like a cool breeze invisible and passin' you by
But it's me, fool, it isn't you
Quit wondering why
Chorus 2X:
Ayo it's F R I Z Z O
Oh no, Yeah Here I go again
It'd be a sign of the times if I get famous off of this shit
Yeah, it probably means it's the End



Second Verse:
And what you're seeing is what happens when you're good the game
I'm hella laced putting simple motherfuckers to shame
I'm hella shameless on this earth I hope you all know my name
You'd all have to suck my dick to figure out why I came
I got my set on my wrist I got my state on my chain
Getting brain from bad bitches and got digits on my brain
Living this thang called life like it isn't no thang
Middle finger in the sky and I'ma let it just hang
My kicks are clean my tees are white
Yo Check my itinerary where will I be tonight
Yo I'ma be wherever I please
With whomever I please
Fitting twins in the two-seater I don't care if it's a tight squeeze

Chorus 2X:
Ayo it's F R I Z Z O
Oh no, Yeah Here I go again
It'd be a sign of the times if I get famous off of this shit
Yeah, it probably means it's the End
Third Verse:
So you can break with all your negative shit
Watch me hit switches and dip Witness a miracle get a whiff of this grip
And all I ever wanted was to be the one that was hip quit hating on my lifestyle
Because you know you love it
American trendsetter rep the twenty-third letter Stick around
Because I'm only getting better
From being on house arrest and rockin' a federal tether
To being in the air networking with other go-getters
That's how I'm living now Take my threats literal
I'm living it up you suckers can never live it down
Bringing back quality ra like it's 95
Because I'm too saavy to slip and too savage to die

Chorus 4X to fade:
Ayo it's F R I Z Z O
Oh no, Yeah Here I go again
It'd be a sign of the times if I get famous off of this shit

8276,"Even if you have eclectic tastes, if you're under 30, chances are good you listen to little or no classical music. This isn't an admonition; it's a fact, and one you've probably heard before in an admonishing tone. For decades, classical music has been in lugubrious decline. This trend has become a grave concern for people whose livelihoods are built on the music. Later this month, the League of American Orchestras is convening a conference to kick-start an ""Orchestra R/Evolution."" Whatever innovations they devise, it's likely that, barring some unforeseen revival of interest, this decline will continue.

That's where this essay comes in. Though I belong to that generation putatively responsible for the decline, I enjoy 300-year-old fugues. I was weaned on Outkast and the Kinks. And, weirdly enough, Prokofiev and the Pixies. I feel lucky to know the big secret: there's no trick. It's just music. It shreds, yearns, mourns, trills, rages, and smiles. The music is spine-tingling, angry, delicate, vulgar, snobby, bumptious, and transcendental. Anyone who loves music should feel comfortable pulling Messiaen into their mixes.

My thesis is that people aren't listening because they haven't had the right introduction, and because of the image. In today's world, the lovely words ""opera"" and ""symphony"" are redolent with snobbery. (If you want to signal a movie character is a pretentious aesthete, make him a lover of Verdi or—horror!—Wagner.) As I know too well, liking the music is seen as a bit eccentric, if not geriatric, pretentious, and politically reactionary: a bit like wearing furs or an ascot as a twentysomething. It's reasonable, if wrong, that many people share this 24-year-old New York man's view that it's ""millionaire music.""

I hope we can get past that. Classical music is old, but it isn't for old men. The music survived because it is some of the best work humans have done in four centuries. For the thrill of a late-Beethoven trill, it's worth getting past the admittedly stuffy, stagey conventions. (This is already happening in New York, where classical performers saw on nightclub floors.) Besides: the post-modern mind has a genius for stripping things—whether mutton-chops or sitars or kheffiyehs—from their context. It's time Bach, author of the most face-melting harspichord riffs known to man, came in for his turn.

So begins this series of posts meant to introduce my generation to classical music. It wouldn't dream to replace, but bows modestly to very fine precedents from Leonard Bernstein and Benjamin Britten. I will start next week with a starter-kit post on ""How to Listen."" Please share any ideas, questions, or suggestions you might have; the purpose is to enjoy.",misc

I can make you dance if you want me to
You bustas talking trash but ain't making no moves
We live that Long Beach life, so we don't give a fuck
So when you bustas ready we can crank this beat up

[Tray Deee]
Put your brownies in your back pocket grab your strap
We banging once again cause the West is back
It's the Long Beach finest, king of Eastsidaz
Hard as a rock and raw as vaginas
I brought Snoop back to these gangsta beats
Off the No Limit tank to the turf with heat
Search the streets, the whole city heard me speak
Got flowers every hour I conserve the D
Slang dope from the throat with these vocal quotes
Only loc roll these spokes blowing notes to folks
I ain't tripping, catch me hitting six tre switches
Or dipping in the coupe with a group full of women
Dogghouse banging, all out spraying
Strategic position of power and no delaying
Crip hop this not the average rap
Get you hyped up have that ass grabbing your strap
Like a G do, we who the bustas fear
Killa Cali, big daddies only come from here
As you lying, mega don living life to roll
With them hot girls with them pretty nails and toes
From Long Beach to Crenshaw, Promona to Compton
Dirty South, Midwest and why it's popping
Tony Touch only what I rap is the truth
So keep the beat bumping while I'm up in the booth

Never leave no evidence, most of us hesitant
I keep it cracking like cocaine
Stay doing the damn thang and let my nuts hang

V-12 stomping, grip riding non stopping
Make these marck niggas fear the led more often
Snatch niggas ice cause it's too much flossing
We up to the crack of dawn
Sipping on Sattin till the Sattin all gone
I smoke so much they call me Hickory D
And fuck so tough they call me Dick-Em-Down-D
I bring muscle game, cause these bustas got rained
Talk too much then a sucker got claimed
I pick the game lock, and keep the thang cocked
And shake a nigga brain like Biggie and Pac
Kadafia the Mafia and LBC
When I spit it homies listen to the profit in me
All black call that what the ladies respect
And those who disrespect done lost state to the left
What you thought, since you heard me rapping I'm soft
Last thang see the flame and the gat as it cough
Revelations in the making best to make your peace
Cause the soldiers don't control from the West to East

7450,"I went for a midnight ride
And I ain't comin’ back
I took all the life in me
And I never regret
Kept walkin' eagerly
To reach the Waters
To find the Man
So I went for a midnight ride
And I ain't comin’ back

It's now or never again!

I got to the last city on earth
Where all desires melt
And the sky pours into the ocean
And all that's left is death
Made my way to the worst of bars
And met the son of man
And i said:
""He gave you wood and nails
But I got only regrets""
""And holes in my hands to feel sorry for what I take
And a punch in the belly for every crying step I take""
If you can make me forget my name
And grow the Man outta these tired ways
Push my head now under the Water or never again!""

Down the Water

In the water

Down the Water

Better than this
Brighter than this

You'll find a life
Better than this
Louder than this

I know your past few tears
Been influenced by the last few years
Mascara gets smeared
Exhaustion's never been this clear
Don't be discouraged by this hurt you feel
Cuz you young baby, you don't gotta rush it
Time is on your side, like a pair of crutches
You say niggas ain't shit, they ain't worth nothing
Cuz when you give a shit about them, they just flush it
Scared to give your all, you scared of rejection
Just another insecurity to add to your collection
So these days you wear a feeling proof vest for protection
So now the good niggas shoot their shot with apprehension
You always falling victim to your loving nature
Giving niggas second chances every time they play you
Like your mom, your heart is bigger than a million acres
Don't let your luck with Cupid ever be the thing that change it

[Chorus: Ashley Mehta]
You can stop explaining, for me boy
What you running from
You're holding onto me so damn tight
And I used to love you
I used to give you
I used to show you some things
But now I don't know you
Things that we been through
But I know you can't say the same
[Verse 2: LEW]
I never get it
Why you build them niggas up then always let them take the credit
Investing every second into guys who put you second
I think maybe you should be a little more selective
With who you give your trust, dedication, and affection
Because spending time on the wrong ones can get expensive
You want somebody thats gonna go the distance
You want that spark like match friction
You want that love that got no conditions
Finding Mr. Perfect don't seem worth it do it
But the heart break along the way could have some purpose to it
Just to show you you got soul that can't no nigga ruin
To show you that your heart is pure and can't no man pollute it
I know you're worth it
The scars and bruises only on the surface
Besides, your imperfections are the traits that make you perfect
Inside I see a diamond in the rough and thats for certain
Thats why I wrote these verses

[Chorus: Ashley Mehta]
You can stop explaining, for me boy
What you running from
You're holding onto me so damn tight
And I used to love you
I used to give you
I used to show you some things
But now I don't know you
Things that we been through
But I know you can't say the same

Quarter after 2 is when I used to love you
And now you're alone
Suddenly falling
Holding onto you is what I used to love doing
Do it again, no but I can't choose you

You can stop explaining, for me boy
What you running from
You're holding onto me so damn tight
And I used to love you

Yo! Wild Wes in the house
You gonna hear the sickness
From me and CRZFawkz. Listen to this

[Verse 1: Wild Wes]
Imma tell you bout some people who'll never see the light
Dr Gonzo just wants to start a fight
He ain't gettin' anything from me, he ain't a real homie
If I had to get him to understand I'd have to rap slowly
Don't talk trash! You'll never get anywhere
The trash that you talk about is just not fair
I've got some good beats. You can't disagree
A hater makes a song, it's not my cup of tea
You wanna talk wack. But you can't do better
If you thought you could bring out the beat maker
I'll show you how i'm gonna make this beat
I won't let you look away until it's complete
You wanna be the best. But you don't listen to classics
Heck, yall don't even know the basics

People gonna know what it's like to be a punk
It's time they realize it's time for the funk
There about the feel the bass
Bumping their head and moving the face
I've got the good bass, you've got the good reaction
Messing with me, it's time for some action
A brotha gonna make you go
I try with my music, you all want the dough

Get the haters outta here!

Always hating boy
I'm in a rapping state, call it Illnois
I'm just chilling and got bars to deploy
All you haters ever do is annoy
We in the Flex gang, no question
On the twitter you won't get a mention
CRZFawkz getting paid like a pension
Bass and the drums collide, you can feel the tension
Second collab with Wild Wes
The normies follow trends like Simon Says
You're just salty cause you're in debt
When it comes to good music you got no respect
They say they wanna rap
They don't know crap
Try to run up on me and your face gets smacked
I need the cash, CRZ be on the fricking dash
This be a smash

On my daddy's knee
He had big bear paws
And shoes size 13 EEE
And he seemed to me
To be larger than life

He had a heart bigger
Than any house on our avenue
A voice and a smile to match it, too
And when he called for you
He sounded larger than life

Kids grow up, they figure out
They learn what life's about
That not all things are actual size
Like the picture on a cereal box
Of a toy surprise
Some things are larger than life

Now I use to run off
To the fishin' hole
With my brother
Cousin and cane pole
Where every fish we caught
Was larger than life
Now my brother fixes people
My cousin fixes cars
And those days gone
By seem so distant and far
Like the battles we fought
That were larger than life

Kids grow up, they figure out
They learn what life's about
That not all things are actual size
Big trouble comes in little white lies
Some things get larger than life

I was seven years old
The day I walked the aisle
And I saw my mama's tears
And my daddy's smile
And that moment
Seemed larger than life

`Cause there were angels
Rejoicing all around
Over the good news
And great joy I had found
In a little manger boy
Who was larger than life

They learn what life's about
That not all things are actual size
There's more than just what meets the eyes

Do we have a way to make it through

I'm choosing to find the light in the dark right now
A lot of people get shady when the sun goes down
When they find out you're a kind they'll try take your crown
Woke up this morning had to overcome what I was feeling
Tried to take a bath but there was no water in my building
Thirty minutes later I could hear my phone was ringing
That's an alarm reminding me to keep aiming for the ceiling
Got out of bed, don't need breakfast I just need my PC
Gotta find a beat where I can place what I was feeling
Gotta make sure that my lyrics are far-reaching
So that the screen can be the only place they get to see me
Four hours late I'm reminded I have work to do
But school work is not exactly what I love to do
But what choice do I have as an African?
Without a degree they would probably treat me like I'm Scooby-Doo
I don't want the residue I just want the revenue
So they can show respect when I pull up in any avenue
For a hundred billion there's not a thing that I wouldn't do

No more going to church cause I keep sinning even when I pray
But I know Jesus got my back, now I'm tryna get the cash

Might just go to a strip club, order a milkshake
Cause I'm going crazy comparing the choices I should make
I just wanna feel appreciated and always celebrated
I would rather be overrated than to be underrated
I just wanna see all my people happy and elevated
Gotta do this for my bros that died and couldn't make it

Her intentions they're pure

No, she won't be denied

Workin' every mothafuckin' day
I pay myself, I ain't looking for a raise
I know my momma really thought it was a phase
I give a fuck about your comments I ain't phased
I'm cuttin' through the noise, cuttin' through the haze
Don't ask me if I dig ya, I'm diggin' ya grave
I don't need a new friend I'll be okay
I just need my bag and i'll be up out my way
Sleep well, she scheme on, the DL
I bet she think she know me judging off the motherfuckin' TL
Go get a grip, or get a life
They try to kick you when you down, I was taught that I better fight
Now what's the bar? Someone set a height
I'm high-jumping over whatever you thought I would end up like
I'm overpowered like I'm Metaknight
Nobody from the city got a motherfuckin' better set of pipes

Bad bitch look like Tina Fey, and she wanna fuck me like all day
For real
One thing I never do is play, I been servin' y'all up without a tray
For real
Always on the move I can't stay, in a fresh pair of boots no Js
For real
Everyting I wanna say I say, I don't hold nothing back no way
For real

If I pray for it I'ma get it
I never sit around that's pathetic
I could fuck your bitch off aesthetic
She give me good head, cause she know where I'm headed
Blackin' out on every verse
And I'm coming to America like Eddie Murph
Don't make a move unless I run it through with Harry first
You prolly poppin' cause it's ladies first
Ready for whatever, ready for it all
My family always tell me to get more involved
I don't do so well with these events though
Too many questions, man I just end up ignoring y'all
Trust me you don't want it more than necessary
I just seen your career out in the cemetery
You looking for respect and I ain't paying that
I'm looking at my bills like is you paying that
Nah? That's the way it fucking go
Only thing i know is how to grow
I don't let nobody else in unless you hear it on a record boy I keep it on the low, low

My quiet observations on the bus city people lost trust
Maudley's out patients are shouting with the pavements
They looking rough can’t get to grips so they end up looking worse than shit
Maybe if I can see who there talking too I might talk to them to so they can prove
The spirit never lies but before I get to try the clouds open up and let god cry
Why is this white lady nervous cause 3 black youths come on so she checking were her purse is
Make me feel nervous like they ain't my country like they don’t really want me
But mummy always love me I never had a daddy it was me and my mummy
Mummy was my daddy I can either cry or see it as funny
How you can have a child and then just leave
Now I’m walking around with my heart on my sleeve cause I’m effected anytime anybody leave
You can see my scars and hear my silent screams
I been reading books to analyse my dreams and to me it seems
The only chance we get to make sense of it is when we put our heads down a little bit
That’s why I’m spitting it cause each one teach one and you can take it how you want don

Right now I got a lot of work to do
I gotta smooth out my edges
Eat more veges
Listen to my elders
Vibe with my peers
Confront my fears and
Finish this album
Right now I got a lot of work to do
I gotta represent the youth
Speak more truth
Eat more fruit
Get wise with my years
Confront my fears and
Finish this album

But it seems I get side tracked it’s like a mind trap I get a call real late bout were the foods at
Cause certain man a certain place got certain food to taste so my Nikes are laced
And I was never really one to stay awake through a working day for them little bit pay yo
This nine to five is just killing me slowly but quitting is for quitters so I wait until they fire me
But now no one will hire me cause I got more lies in my CV than a pro’s had STD’s
When will they see I was born to reign entrapment is my pain I need to feel alive again
I need a man that compliments my style overstand I’m this way until I die
Has ambitions of his own so ovastand i don’t wanna be alone I just need a little time in my zone
This one goes out to my shotters in the alleys were all brothers and sisters were all family
All my sisters trying to raise there babies all the youth man with court cases crazy
It’s like the smarter you are the bigger your worries stupid people are lucky trust me
This one goes out to my people with ambition I’m still learning I’m still trying but for now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Honesty is courage and since I got the heart of a lion then there’s no sense in lying
I portray my life over violins no matter what it brings least I’m being real
When I look at my future I fear failure I fear the fact that you might not like me
I know I’m skilled but just maybe slightly what if my light don’t shine so brightly
I’m scared of that I’m telling you the truth I’m scared of that
What if the doctor said you couldn’t have children
What if the system they tried to topple what I’m billing better living for all my ghetto children
And I don’t mean were you live I mean your state of mind
Cause ghettos not just a place ghetto is a vibe
And I don’t need no boastie words or complicated flows
If I know what I gotta do then I flow
But sometimes I get tired sometimes I lose faith I guess that’s the reason that we got to church
Cause when you at the bottom of the barrel it hurts need something to believe in and God works You think spiritual is just hocus pocus what you really saying is you have not noticed
Inside us all is a silent protest you can acknowledge or ignore but me

Before thee raises - The abode of Kismets walls
As the incarnated moirais in robes of white
Spinning and cutting the twined thread of life

Usurper of the netherworld, a servants matter
Aberrant and lone with past tracks shattered
In search through the hollow and winding maze
With the cicerone carrying the adept through the grades

Further beyond
For thirst bounds the flesh to life

Farther beyond
For thirst of death to life
Where Tehoms breath caresses the neck
A sense of enlightment deep in an emptied chest
A sudden blaze burns out blackened eyes
But the eye ahead sights a devoted child

Traverse the pathway of concealment within
With the loyalty of night's heroin
Unwrapping the seals of a third blighted orb
With the deeds of our righteous lord

Dumbledore made and Draco and I follow him. He kept shouting at us angrily.

“You ludacris fools!” he shouted.

I started to cry tears of blood down my pallid face. Draco comforted me. When we went back to the castle Dumbledore took us to Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall who were both looking very angry.

“They were having sexual intercourse in the Forbidden Forest!” he yelled in a furious voice.

“Why did you do such a thing, you mediocre dunces?” asked Professor McGonagall.

“How dare you?” demanded Professor Snape.

And then Draco shrieked. “BECAUSE I LOVE HER!”

Everyone was quiet. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall still looked mad but Professor Snape said. “Fine. Very well. You may go up to your rooms.”

Draco and I went upstairs while the teachers glared at us.
“Are you okay, Ebony?” Draco asked me gently.

“Yeah I guess.” I lied. I went to the girl’s dorm and brushed my teeth and my hair and changed into a low-cut black floor-length dress with red lace all around it and black high heels. When I came out….

Draco was standing in front of the bathroom, and he started to sing ‘I just wanna live’ by Good Charlotte. I was so flattered, even though he wasn’t supposed to be there. We hugged and kissed. After that, we said goodnight and he reluctantly went back into his room.",misc

5562,"My bathroom remains the only place I'm ever naked
Smashing soap into my hands each morning
The shower throat all belching there behind me, bloated with my shedded skin. Good riddance
One son restroom away, my blinds clench up on the California sun
Setting fire to the dust and possibly day pull on my apartment and I
A genuine fear as to where all this sleeping leads has got you thinking thin about what you would and wouldn't do to survive
You would not dig for a fresh wet wishbone in a still kicking chicken chest
You would not dissolve small slices of unraveled arm under your tongue
You'd maybe kill the power to your hand, but that's about it
Really, you know
The razor for your face cannot cut kids from your male animal abdomen
You were not born the moment your stomach was finished
Your one wing plucked eyes half filled
And wild yolk like so sliced into a since

So I ask you
Have you ever really had a hand fall off?
Or found your mailman in your home
Eating one of your new poems, holding a knife to your bills
Half swallow the scream, you can't cut
And still keep all the juice in that half opened up arm
By tightening the ropes of your digital watch
You will grow no ghost to leave this angst to
And this no ghost will wear no locket for the safe keeping of your fear
To dangle like a heart
So it may always and forever hear the gulping throats
Of all your slopping drops of blood
Like this was something beautiful
When compared to your red skeleton
Like you say
You've asked nicely for your arm back
Except...

And everytime the sun leaves you alone on a far curve of the planet
You think you can feel the whole slung six pounds of cartoon heart
And all its iron tugging drugs towards it",pop

Make a lil stop at Citgo
Keep that love on blast
Load that shit in that pistol
Gotta let go of your past
Gotta forgive your heroes
Nobody perfect
And you don't deserve it if somebody doing you dirt
Everyone hurtin', we all in our Birkin'
We human, we live, and we learn
I don't rehearse it, I gotta keep moving
But homie you do what you feel
I let you into the darkest and beautiful moments
A artist, I did it for real

I didn't settle for deals (no)
Lately I get up and heal (yes)
I got a crib on the bеach (yes)
Finally somethin for me (yеs)
I do not want no revenge (no)
Really I rather be friends (yes)
Y'all niggas beef with ya self (why)
You carry that shit to the end (yuh)

I used to be like you
And hold on to that BS too
Old shit like a PS2
And break ties with a BFF
Mad shit that I regret too
I'm on the way though
Out in rodeo
Smiling and living
Till one day I KO
God is my witness
The sun on my payroll
The love that she give me
Is realer than J Lo

Call my Mama
Call my Daddy
Said I'm pulling up
Call my homies
Call yo homies
Let's enjoy the love
Fuck yo ego
Fuck yo demons

Showing love
Show you fuckin right

I love Sunday mornings
Mama open up that window
Dad stay home that day
Mommy gonna make some pancakes
Ima go play with the hood kids
Ima come back for a band aid
Stay from the store where the crooks is
Got a lot of reads on the book list
Sharing them gems with the fan base (ya)

[Verse 3]
Everyday
Tryna get the win, like the NBA
Giving my all till I pass out
If you beat me you deserve that
Doing my best till the dirt nap
I was sitting in the dirt where the worms at
I done visited hell where the worst at
Niggas really dragged me through the mud and it hurt bad
Fuck it
Lately that shit don't cut it
Got thick skin, like run it
Not a lot that I can't stomach
Road block, yes I love it
Stand my ground y'all running
Devil know that I am comin
4th down, down 14 nigga I ain't punting
Never see the kid get sluggish
Never see me drop no rubbish
Never see me sell my soul

[Bridge 3]
Oh
If you ain't know
Just cause it glitter don't mean that it gold
Shawty be pretty and poisonous
I be avoiding it, all that I'm seeing is growth
I used to be in the cold
Now I'm in Cali, they sayin they seeing the glow
I really be in the zone
If it ain't good for my people, I leave it alone

I had a prof. tell me the content achieve less
So it's good to be blue then, I guess
Better yet if it's your blood and not your collar
Get cheddar by the flood, not work for every dollar
I was born in the middle, the son of two scholars
Sworn never to belittle the few daughters
That have kids early cause they're just too girly
One child straight hair, the other curly
Got her offspring gene pool all swirly
Due to two dudes a little extra burly
Who left them: the chick and her children
""Eff"" them, those vile societal villains
I am so willin' to steal a drill and kill them
And drop their lot from the top of the tallest buildin'
As a sign to all those with similar roles
Who chose to fill holes, then quickly stroll

No Lord, it can’t be true
What has the world come to?
No Lord, it can’t be you

The world is full of so many mean players
I see their faces when I play team slayer
Compared to past boys, we have odder toys
Two lines ago, I meant Waterboy
My right-mind speaks silent with creative visuals
Though I have an awkward walk like a stroll, pidgeon-toed
My inner-self desires peace and harmony
My sinner-self wants to seize an armory
Squeeze some arteries and bring some harm to me
He tries so ardently, but he finds it hard to be
Brought to life and bodily manifested
My naughty side, he is Santa detested
Bested, he’s been, easily, until recently
When I learned how Enron heads treated the
People below them, and Martha Stewart also
Why be a good servant, if you could be the boss, bro?

With a covert goal of rooftop running
Criminal chasing, nightly thug hunting
Minimal chafing to my daily smug stunting
Out in the open way before the sun sets
Smiling for the paparazzi in my suit or vest
But when the night falls, I hit the booth with stress
Am I some kinda sleuth? The truth is yes
As an agent of justice, I produce pain
The public must discuss this black Bruce Wayne
Cops unemployed, so many convicts slain
Crime near destroyed, evil wanes
I long for the time when my day’s spent
Seeking out crimes in my basement
To don nines at night in fine raiment
So people will never again lament:

Challenging each to each --
This from her mountain-side,
That from her burthened beach.

They count their ships full tale --
Their corn and oil and wine,
Derrick and loom and bale,
And rampart's gun-flecked line;
City by City they hail:
""Hast aught to match with mine?""

And the men that breed from them
They traffic up and down,
But cling to their cities' hem
As a child to their mother's gown.

When they talk with the stranger bands,
Dazed and newly alone;
When they walk in the stranger lands,
By roaring streets unknown;
Blessing her where she stands
For strength above their own.
(On high to hold her fame
That stands all fame beyond,
By oath to back the same,
Most faithful-foolish-fond;
Making her mere-breathed name
Their bond upon their bond.)

So thank I God my birth
Fell not in isles aside --
Waste headlands of the earth,
Or warring tribes untried --
But that she lent me worth
And gave me right to pride.

Surely in toil or fray
Under an alien sky,
Comfort it is to say:
""Of no mean city am I!""

Come I to mine estate --
Mother of Cities to me,
For I was born in her gate,
Between the palms and the sea,
Where the world-end steamers wait.)
Now for this debt I owe,
And for her far-borne cheer
Must I make haste and go
With tribute to her pier.

And she shall touch and remit
After the use of kings

And purchase in all lands.

For seeing Beelzebub is prince of phantasms, inhabitants of his dominion of air and darkness, the children of darkness, and these demons, phantasms, or spirits of illusion, signify allegorically the same thing. This considered, the kingdom of darkness, as it is set forth in these and other places of the Scripture, is nothing else but a confederacy of deceivers that, to obtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour, by dark and erroneous doctrines, to extinguish in them the light, both of nature and of the gospel; and so to disprepare them for the kingdom of God to come.

410 John, 16. 11

As men that are utterly deprived from their nativity of the light of the bodily eye have no idea at all of any such light; and no man conceives in his imagination any greater light than he hath at some time or other perceived by his outward senses: so also is it of the light of the gospel, and of the light of the understanding, that no man can conceive there is any greater degree of it than that which he hath already attained unto. And from hence it comes to pass that men have no other means to acknowledge their own darkness but only by reasoning from the unforeseen mischances that befall them in their ways. The darkest part of the kingdom of Satan is that which is without the Church of God; that is to say, amongst them that believe not in Jesus Christ. But we cannot say that therefore the Church enjoyeth, as the land of Goshen, all the light which to the performance of the work enjoined us by God is necessary. Whence comes it that in Christendom there has been, almost from the time of the Apostles, such jostling of one another out of their places, both by foreign and civil war; such stumbling at every little asperity of their own fortune, and every little eminence of that of other men; and such diversity of ways in running to the same mark, felicity, if it be not night amongst us, or at least a mist? We are therefore yet in the dark.

The enemy has been here in the night of our natural ignorance, and sown the tares of spiritual errors; and that, first, by abusing and putting out the light of the Scriptures: for we err, not knowing the Scriptures. Secondly, by introducing the demonology of the heathen poets, that is to say, their fabulous doctrine concerning demons, which are but idols, or phantasms of the brain, without any real nature of their own, distinct from human fancy; such as are dead men's ghosts, and fairies, and other matter of old wives' tales. Thirdly, by mixing with the Scripture diverse relics of the religion, and much of the vain and erroneous philosophy of the Greeks, especially of Aristotle. Fourthly, by mingling with both these, false or uncertain traditions, and feigned or uncertain history. And so we come to err, by giving heed to seducing spirits, and the demonology of such as speak lies in hypocrisy, or, as it is in the original, ""of those that play the part of liars,""411 with a seared conscience, that is, contrary to their own knowledge. Concerning the first of these, which is the seducing of men by abuse of Scripture, I intend to speak briefly in this chapter.

411 I Timothy, 4. 1, 2

The greatest and main abuse of Scripture, and to which almost all the rest are either consequent or subservient, is the wresting of it to prove that the kingdom of God, mentioned so often in the Scripture, is the present Church, or multitude of Christian men now living, or that, being dead, are to rise again at the last day: whereas the kingdom of God was first instituted by the ministry of Moses, over the Jews only; who were therefore called his peculiar people; and ceased afterward, in the election of Saul, when they refused to be governed by God any more, and demanded a king after the manner of the nations; which God Himself consented unto, as I have more at large proved before, in the thirty-fifth Chapter. After that time, there was no other kingdom of God in the world, by any pact or otherwise, than He ever was, is, and shall be king of all men and of all creatures, as governing according to His will, by His infinite power. Nevertheless, He promised by His prophets to restore this His government to them again, when the time He hath in His secret counsel appointed for it shall be fully come, and when they shall turn unto Him by repentance and amendment of life. And not only so, but He invited also the Gentiles to come in, and enjoy the happiness of His reign, on the same conditions of conversion and repentance. And He promised also to send His Son into the world, to expiate the sins of them all by his death, and to prepare them by his doctrine to receive him at his second coming: which second coming not yet being, the kingdom of God is not yet come, and we are not now under any other kings by pact but our civil sovereigns; saving only that Christian men are already in the kingdom of grace, inasmuch as they have already the promise of being received at his coming again.
Consequent to this error, that the present Church is Christ's kingdom, there ought to be some one man, or assembly, by whose mouth our Saviour, now in heaven, speaketh, giveth law, and which representeth his person to all Christians; or diverse men, or diverse assemblies that do the same to diverse parts of Christendom. This power regal under Christ being challenged universally by the Pope, and in particular Commonwealths by assemblies of the pastors of the place (when the Scripture gives it to none but to civil sovereigns), comes to be so passionately disputed that it putteth out the light of nature, and causeth so great a darkness in men's understanding that they see not who it is to whom they have engaged their obedience.

Consequent to this claim of the Pope to vicar general of Christ in the present Church (supposed to be that kingdom of his to which we are addressed in the gospel) is the doctrine that it is necessary for a Christian king to receive his crown by a bishop; as if it were from that ceremony that he derives the clause of Dei gratia in his title; and that then only is he made king by the favour of God when he is crowned by the authority of God's universal vicegerent on earth; and that every bishop, whosoever be his sovereign, taketh at his consecration an oath of absolute obedience to the Pope. Consequent to the same is the doctrine of the fourth Council of Lateran, held under Pope Innocent the Third (Chapter 3, De Haereticis), ""That if a king, at the pope's admonition, do not purge his kingdom of heresies, and being excommunicate for the same, do not give satisfaction within a year, his subjects are absolved of the bond of their obedience."" Whereby heresies are understood all opinions which the Church of Rome hath forbidden to be maintained. And by this means, as often as there is any repugnancy between the political designs of the Pope and other Christian princes, as there is very often, there ariseth such a mist amongst their subjects, that they know not a stranger that thrusteth himself into the throne of their lawful prince, from him whom they had themselves placed there; and, in this darkness of mind, are made to fight one against another, without discerning their enemies from their friends, under the conduct of another man's ambition.

From the same opinion, that the present Church is the kingdom of God, it proceeds that pastors, deacons, and all other ministers of the Church take the name to themselves of the clergy; giving to other Christians the name of laity, that is, simply people. For clergy signifies those whose maintenance is that revenue which God, having reserved to Himself during His reign over the Israelites, assigned to the tribe of Levi (who were to be His public ministers, and had no portion of land set them out to live on, as their brethren) to be their inheritance. The Pope therefore (pretending the present Church to be, as the realms of Israel, the kingdom of God), challenging to himself and his subordinate ministers the like revenue as the inheritance of God, the name of clergy was suitable to that claim. And thence it is that tithes and other tributes paid to the Levites as God's right, amongst the Israelites, have a long time been demanded and taken of Christians by ecclesiastics, jure divino, that is, in God's right. By which means, the people everywhere were obliged to a double tribute; one to the state, another to the clergy; whereof that to the clergy, being the tenth of their revenue, is double to that which a king of Athens (and esteemed a tyrant) exacted of his subjects for the defraying of all public charges: for he demanded no more but the twentieth part, and yet abundantly maintained therewith the Commonwealth. And in the kingdom of the Jews, during the sacerdotal reign of God, the tithes and offerings were the whole public revenue.

From the same mistaking of the present Church for the kingdom of God came in the distinction between the civil and the canon laws: the civil law being the acts of sovereigns in their own dominions, and the canon law being the acts of the Pope in the same dominions. Which canons, though they were but canons, that is, rules propounded, and but voluntarily received by Christian princes, till the translation of the Empire to Charlemagne; yet afterwards, as the power of the Pope increased, became rules commanded, and the emperors themselves, to avoid greater mischiefs, which the people blinded might be led into, were forced to let them pass for laws.

From hence it is that in all dominions where the Pope's ecclesiastical power is entirely received, Jews, Turks, and Gentiles are in the Roman Church tolerated in their religion as far forth as in the exercise and profession thereof they offend not against the civil power: whereas in a Christian, though a stranger, not to be of the Roman religion is capital, because the Pope pretendeth that all Christians are his subjects. For otherwise it were as much against the law of nations to persecute a Christian stranger for professing the religion of his own country, as an infidel; or rather more, inasmuch as they that are not against Christ are with him.

From the same it is that in every Christian state there are certain men that are exempt, by ecclesiastical liberty, from the tributes and from the tribunals of the civil state; for so are the secular clergy, besides monks and friars, which in many places bear so great a proportion to the common people as, if need were, there might be raised out of them alone an army sufficient for any war the Church militant should employ them in against their own or other princes.

A second general abuse of Scripture is the turning of consecration into conjuration, or enchantment. To consecrate is, in Scripture, to offer, give, or dedicate, in pious and decent language and gesture, a man or any other thing to God, by separating of it from common use; that is to say, to sanctify, or make it God's, and to be used only by those whom God hath appointed to be His public ministers (as I have already proved at large in the thirty-fifth Chapter), and thereby to change, not the thing consecrated, but only the use of it, from being profane and common, to be holy, and peculiar to God's service. But when by such words the nature or quality of the thing itself is pretended to be changed, it is not consecration, but either an extraordinary work of God, or a vain and impious conjuration. But seeing, for the frequency of pretending the change of nature in their consecrations, it cannot be esteemed a work extraordinary, it is no other than a conjuration or incantation, whereby they would have men to believe an alteration of nature that is not, contrary to the testimony of man's sight and of all the rest of his senses. As for example, when the priest, instead of consecrating bread and wine to God's peculiar service in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper (which is but a separation of it from the common use to signify, that is, to put men in mind of, their redemption by the Passion of Christ, whose body was broken and blood shed upon the cross for our transgressions), pretends that by saying of the words of our Saviour, ""This is my body,"" and ""This is my blood,"" the nature of bread is no more there, but his very body; notwithstanding there appeareth not to the sight or other sense of the receiver anything that appeared not before the consecration. The Egyptian conjurers, that are said to have turned their rods to serpents, and the water into blood, are thought but to have deluded the senses of the spectators by a false show of things, yet are esteemed enchanters. But what should we have thought of them if there had appeared in their rods nothing like a serpent, and in the water enchanted nothing like blood, nor like anything else but water, but that they had faced down the king, that they were serpents that looked like rods, and that it was blood that seemed water? That had been both enchantment and lying. And yet in this daily act of the priest, they do the very same, by turning the holy words into the manner of a charm, which produceth nothing new to the sense; but they face us down, that it hath turned the bread into a man; nay, more, into a God; and require men to worship it as if it were our Saviour himself present, God and Man, and thereby to commit most gross idolatry. For if it be enough to excuse it of idolatry to say it is no more bread, but God; why should not the same excuse serve the Egyptians, in case they had the faces to say the leeks and onions they worshipped were not very leeks and onions, but a divinity under their species or likeness? The words, ""This is my body,"" are equivalent to these, ""This signifies, or represents, my body""; and it is an ordinary figure of speech: but to take it literally is an abuse; nor, though so taken, can it extend any further than to the bread which Christ himself with his own hands consecrated. For he never said that of what bread soever any priest whatsoever should say, ""This is my body,"" or ""This is Christ's body,"" the same should presently be transubstantiated. Nor did the Church of Rome ever establish this transubstantiation, till the time of Innocent the Third; which was not above five hundred years ago, when the power of Popes was at the highest, and the darkness of the time grown so great, as men discerned not the bread that was given them to eat, especially when it was stamped with the figure of Christ upon the cross, as if they would have men believe it were transubstantiated, not only into the body of Christ, but also into the wood of his cross, and that they did eat both together in the sacrament.

The like incantation, instead of consecration, is used also in the sacrament of baptism: where the abuse of God's name in each several person, and in the whole Trinity, with the sign of the cross at each name, maketh up the charm. As first, when they make the holy water, the priest saith, ""I conjure thee, thou creature of water, in the name of God the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord, and in virtue of the Holy Ghost, that thou become conjured water, to drive away all the powers of the enemy, and to eradicate, and supplant the enemy,"" etc. And the same in the benediction of the salt to be mingled with it, ""That thou become conjured salt, that all phantasms and knavery of the Devil's fraud may fly and depart from the place wherein thou art sprinkled; and every unclean spirit be conjured by him that shall come to judge the quick and the dead."" The same in the benediction of the oil, ""That all the power of the enemy, all the host of the Devil, all assaults and phantasms of Satan, may be driven away by this creature of oil."" And for the infant that is to be baptized, he is subject to many charms: first, at the church door the priest blows thrice in the child's face, and says, ""Go out of him, unclean spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost the Comforter."" As if all children, till blown on by the priest, were demoniacs. Again, before his entrance into the church, he saith as before, ""I conjure thee, etc., to go out, and depart from this servant of God""; and again the same exorcism is repeated once more before he be baptized. These and some other incantations are those that are used instead of benedictions and consecrations in administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper; wherein everything that serveth to those holy uses, except the unhallowed spittle of the priest, hath some set form of exorcism.
Nor are the other rites, as of marriage, of extreme unction, of visitation of the sick, of consecrating churches, and churchyards, and the like, exempt from charms; inasmuch as there is in them the use of enchanted oil and water, with the abuse of the cross, and of the holy word of David, asperges me Domine hyssopo, as things of efficacy to drive away phantasms and imaginary spirits.

Another general error is from the misinterpretation of the words eternal life, everlasting death, and the second death. For though we read plainly in Holy Scripture that God created Adam in an estate of living for ever, which was conditional, that is to say, if he disobeyed not His commandment; which was not essential to human nature, but consequent to the virtue of the tree of life, whereof he had liberty to eat, as long as he had not sinned; and that he was thrust out of Paradise after he had sinned, lest he should eat thereof, and live for ever; and that Christ's Passion is a discharge of sin to all that believe on Him, and by consequence, a restitution of eternal life to all the faithful, and to them only: yet the doctrine is now and hath been a long time far otherwise; namely, that every man hath eternity of life by nature, inasmuch as his soul is immortal. So that the flaming sword at the entrance of Paradise, though it hinder a man from coming to the tree of life, hinders him not from the immortality which God took from him for his sin, nor makes him to need the sacrificing of Christ for the recovering of the same; and consequently, not only the faithful and righteous, but also the wicked and the heathen, shall enjoy eternal life, without any death at all, much less a second and everlasting death. To salve this, it is said that by second and everlasting death is meant a second and everlasting life, but in torments; a figure never used but in this very case.

All which doctrine is founded only on some of the obscurer places of the New Testament; which nevertheless, the whole scope of the Scripture considered, are clear enough in a different sense, and unnecessary to the Christian faith. For supposing that when a man dies, there remaineth nothing of him but his carcass; cannot God, that raised inanimated dust and clay into a living creature by His word, as easily raise a dead carcass to life again, and continue him alive for ever, or make him die again by another word? The soul, in Scripture, signifieth always either the life or the living creature; and the body and soul jointly, the body alive. In the fifth day of the Creation, God said, Let the waters produce reptile animae viventis, the creeping thing that hath in it a living soul; the English translate it, ""that hath life."" And again, God created whales, et omnem animam viventem; which in the English is, ""every living creature."" And likewise of man, God made him of the dust of the earth, and breathed in his face the breath of life, et factus est homo in animam viventem, that is, ""and man was made a living creature."" And after Noah came out of the ark, God saith, He will no more smite omnem animam viventem, that is, ""every living creature."" And, ""Eat not the blood, for the blood is the soul""; that is, the life. From which places, if by soul were meant a substance incorporeal, with an existence separated from the body, it might as well be inferred of any other living creature, as of man. But that the souls of the faithful are not of their own nature, but by God's special grace, to remain in their bodies from the resurrection to all eternity, I have already, I think, sufficiently proved out of the Scriptures, in the thirty-eighth Chapter. And for the places of the New Testament where it is said that any man shall be cast body and soul into hell fire, it is no more than body and life; that is to say, they shall be cast alive into the perpetual fire of Gehenna.

This window it is that gives entrance to the dark doctrine, first, of eternal torments, and afterwards of purgatory, and consequently of the walking abroad, especially in places consecrated, solitary, or dark, of the ghosts of men deceased; and thereby to the pretences of exorcism and conjuration of phantasms, as also of invocation of men dead; and to the doctrine of indulgences; that is to say, of exemption for a time, or for ever, from the fire of purgatory, wherein these incorporeal substances are pretended by burning to be cleansed and made fit for heaven. For men being generally possessed, before the time of our Saviour, by contagion of the demonology of the Greeks, of an opinion that the souls of men were substances distinct from their bodies; and therefore that when the body was dead, the soul of every man, whether godly or wicked, must subsist somewhere by virtue of its own nature, without acknowledging therein any supernatural gift of God's; the doctors of the Church doubted a long time what was the place which they were to abide in, till they should be reunited to their bodies in the resurrection, supposing for a while, they lay under the altars: but afterward the Church of Rome found it more profitable to build for them this place of purgatory, which by some other Churches, in this later age, has been demolished.

Let us now consider what texts of Scripture seem most to confirm these three general errors I have here touched. As for those which Cardinal Bellarmine hath alleged for the present kingdom of God administered by the Pope (than which there are none that make a better show of proof), I have already answered them; and made it evident that the kingdom of God, instituted by Moses, ended in the election of Saul: after which time the priest of his own authority never deposed any king. That which the high priest did to Athaliah was not done in his own right, but in the right of the young King Joash, her son: But Solomon in his own right deposed the high priest Abiathar, and set up another in his place. The most difficult place to answer, of all those that can be brought to prove the kingdom of God by Christ is already in this world, is alleged, not by Bellarmine, nor any other of the Church of Rome, but by Beza, that will have it to begin from the resurrection of Christ. But whether he intend thereby to entitle the presbytery to the supreme power ecclesiastical in the Commonwealth of Geneva, and consequently to every presbytery in every other Commonwealth, or to princes and other civil sovereigns, I do not know. For the presbytery hath challenged the power to excommunicate their own kings, and to be the supreme moderators in religion, in the places where they have that form of Church government, no less than the Pope challengeth it universally.

The words are, ""Verily I say unto you, that there be some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.""412 Which words, if taken grammatically, make it certain that either some of those men that stood by Christ at that time are yet alive, or else that the kingdom of God must be now in this present world. And then there is another place more difficult: for when the Apostles after our Saviour's resurrection, and immediately before his ascension, asked our Saviour, saying, ""Wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?"" he answered them, ""It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power; but ye shall receive power by the coming of the Holy Ghost upon you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth"":413 which is as much as to say, My kingdom is not yet come, nor shall you foreknow when it shall come; for it shall come as a thief in the night; but I will send you the Holy Ghost, and by him you shall have power to bear witness to all the world, by your preaching of my resurrection, and the works I have done, and the doctrine I have taught, that they may believe in me, and expect eternal life, at my coming again. How does this agree with the coming of Christ's kingdom at the resurrection? And that which St. Paul says, ""That they turned from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven"";414 where ""to wait for His Son from heaven"" is to wait for his coming to be king in power; which were not necessary if his kingdom had been then present. Again, if the kingdom of God began, as Beza on that place415 would have it, at the resurrection; what reason is there for Christians ever since the resurrection to say in their prayers, ""Let thy kingdom come""? It is therefore manifest that the words of St. Mark are not so to be interpreted. There be some of them that stand here, saith our Saviour, that shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come in power. If then this kingdom were to come at the resurrection of Christ, why is it said, some of them, rather than all? For they all lived till after Christ was risen.
412 Mark, 9. 1

413 Acts, 1. 6

414 I Thessalonians, 1. 9, 10

415 Mark, 9. 1

But they that require an exact interpretation of this text, let them interpret first the like words of our Saviour to St. Peter concerning St. John, ""If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?""416 upon which was grounded a report that he should not die. Nevertheless the truth of that report was neither confirmed, as well grounded; nor refuted, as ill grounded on those words; but left as a saying not understood. The same difficulty is also in the place of St. Mark. And if it be lawful to conjecture at their meaning, by that which immediately follows, both here and in St. Luke, where the same is again repeated, it is not improbable to say they have relation to the Transfiguration, which is described in the verses immediately following, where it is said that ""After six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John"" (not all, but some of his Disciples), ""and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves, and was transfigured before them. And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them. And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus,"" etc. So that they saw Christ in glory and majesty, as he is to come; insomuch as ""they were sore afraid."" And thus the promise of our Saviour was accomplished by way of vision. For it was a vision, as may probably be inferred out of St. Luke, that reciteth the same story, and saith that Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:417 but most certainly out of Matthew 17. 9 where the same is again related; for our Saviour charged them, saying, ""Tell no man the vision until the Son of Man be risen from the dead."" Howsoever it be, yet there can from thence be taken no argument to prove that the kingdom of God taketh beginning till the day of judgement.

416 John, 21. 22

417 Luke, 9. 28

As for some other texts to prove the Pope's power over civil sovereigns (besides those of Bellarmine), as that the two swords that Christ and his Apostles had amongst them were the spiritual and the temporal sword, which they say St. Peter had given him by Christ; and that of the two luminaries, the greater signifies the Pope, and the lesser the king; one might as well infer out of the first verse of the Bible that by heaven is meant the Pope, and by earth the king: which is not arguing from Scripture, but a wanton insulting over princes that came in fashion after the time the popes were grown so secure of their greatness as to contemn all Christian kings; and treading on the necks of emperors, to mock both them and the Scripture, in the words of the ninety-first Psalm, ""Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; the young lion and the dragon thou shalt trample under thy feet.""

As for the rites of consecration, though they depend for the most part upon the discretion and judgement of the governors of the Church, and not upon the Scriptures; yet those governors are obliged to such direction as the nature of the action itself requireth; as that the ceremonies, words, gestures be both decent and significant, or at least conformable to the action. When Moses consecrated the tabernacle, the altar, and the vessels belonging to them, he anointed them with the oil which God had commanded to be made for that purpose:418 and they were holy. There was nothing exorcized, to drive away phantasms. The same Moses (the civil sovereign of Israel), when he consecrated Aaron (the high priest) and his sons, did wash them with water (not exorcized water), put their garments upon them, and anointed them with oil; and they were sanctified, to minister unto the Lord in the priest's office, which was a simple and decent cleansing and adorning them before he presented them to God, to be His servants. When King Solomon (the civil sovereign of Israel) consecrated the temple he had built, he stood before all the congregation of Israel; and having blessed them, he gave thanks to God for putting into the heart of his father to build it, and for giving to himself the grace to accomplish the same; and then prayed unto Him, first, to accept that house, though it were not suitable to His infinite greatness, and to hear the prayers of His servants that should pray therein, or (if they were absent) towards it; and lastly, he offered a sacrifice of peace offering, and the house was dedicated.419 Here was no procession; the King stood still in his first place; no exorcized water; no Asperges me, nor other impertinent application of words spoken upon another occasion; but a decent and rational speech, and such as in making to God a present of his new-built house was most conformable to the occasion.

418 Exodus, 40

419 II Kings, 8

We read not that St. John did exorcize the water of Jordan; nor Philip the water of the river wherein he baptized the eunuch; nor that any pastor in the time of the Apostles did take his spittle and put it to the nose of the person to be baptized, and say, in odorem suavitatis, that is, ""for a sweet savour unto the Lord""; wherein neither the ceremony of spittle, for the uncleanness; nor the application of that Scripture, for the levity, can by any authority of man be justified.

To prove that the soul, separated from the body, liveth eternally, not only the souls of the elect, by especial grace, and restoration of the eternal life which Adam lost by sin, and our Saviour restored by the sacrifice of himself to the faithful; but also the souls of reprobates, as a property naturally consequent to the essence of mankind, without other grace of God but that which is universally given to all mankind; there are diverse places which at the first sight seem sufficiently to serve the turn: but such as when I compare them with that which I have before (Chapter thirty-eight) alleged out of the fourteenth of Job seem to me much more subject to a diverse interpretation than the words of Job.
And first there are the words of Solomon, ""Then shall the dust return to dust, as it was, and the spirit shall return to God that gave it.""420 Which may bear well enough (if there be no other text directly against it) this interpretation, that God only knows, but man not, what becomes of a man's spirit when he expireth; and the same Solomon, in the same book, delivereth the same sentence in the sense I have given it. His words are, ""All go to the same place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again; who knoweth that the spirit of man goeth upward, and that the spirit of the beast goeth downward to the earth?""421 That is, none knows but God; nor is it an unusual phrase to say of things we understand not, ""God knows what,"" and ""God knows where."" That of Genesis, 5. 24, ""Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him""; which is expounded, Hebrews, 11. 5, ""He was translated, that he should not die; and was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation, he had this testimony, that he pleased God,"" making as much for the immortality of the body as of the soul, proveth that this his translation was peculiar to them that please God; not common to them with the wicked; and depending on grace, not on nature. But on the contrary, what interpretation shall we give, besides the literal sense of the words of Solomon, ""That which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so doth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast, for all is vanity.""422 By the literal sense, here is no natural immortality of the soul; nor yet any repugnancy with the life eternal, which the elect shall enjoy by grace. And, ""Better is he that hath not yet been than both they"";423 that is, than they that live or have lived; which, if the soul of all them that have lived were immortal, were a hard saying; for then to have an immortal soul were worse than to have no soul at all. And again, ""The living know they shall die, but the dead know not anything"";424 that is, naturally, and before the resurrection of the body.

420 Ecclesiastes, 12. 7

421 Ibid., 3. 20, 21

422 Ibid., 3. 19

423 Ibid., 4. 3

424 Ibid., 9. 5

Another place which seems to make for a natural immortality of the soul is that where our Saviour saith that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are living: but this is spoken of the promise of God, and of their certitude to rise again, not of a life then actual; and in the same sense that God said to Adam that on the day he should eat of the forbidden fruit, he should certainly die; from that time forward he was a dead man by sentence; but not by execution, till almost a thousand years after. So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive by promise, then, when Christ spoke; but are not actually till the resurrection. And the history of Dives and Lazarus make nothing against this, if we take it, as it is, for a parable.

But there be other places of the New Testament where an immortality seemeth to be directly attributed to the to the wicked. For it is evident that they shall all rise to judgement. And it is said besides, in many places, that they shall go into ""everlasting fire, everlasting torments, everlasting punishments; and that the worm of conscience never dieth""; and all this is comprehended in the word everlasting death, which is ordinarily interpreted ""everlasting life in torments"": and yet I can find nowhere that any man shall live in torments everlastingly. Also, it seemeth hard to say that God, who is the Father of mercies, that doth in heaven and earth all that He will; that hath the hearts of all men in His disposing; that worketh in men both to do and to will; and without whose free gift a man hath neither inclination to good nor repentance of evil, should punish men's transgressions without any end of time, and with all the extremity of torture that men can imagine, and more. We are therefore to consider what the meaning is of everlasting fire, and other the like phrases of Scripture.

I have shown already that the kingdom of God by Christ beginneth at the day of judgement: that in that day, the faithful shall rise again, with glorious and spiritual bodies and be his subjects in that his kingdom, which shall be eternal: that they shall neither marry, nor be given in marriage, nor eat and drink, as they did in their natural bodies; but live for ever in their individual persons, without the specifical eternity of generation: and that the reprobates also shall rise again, to receive punishments for their sins: as also that those of the elect, which shall be alive in their earthly bodies at that day, shall have their bodies suddenly changed, and made spiritual and immortal. But that the bodies of the reprobate, who make the kingdom of Satan, shall also be glorious or spiritual bodies, or that they shall be as the angels of God, neither eating, nor drinking, nor engendering; or that their life shall be eternal in their individual persons, as the life of every faithful man is, or as the life of Adam had been if he had not sinned, there is no place of Scripture to prove it; save only these places concerning eternal torments, which may otherwise be interpreted.

From whence may be inferred that, as the elect after the resurrection shall be restored to the estate wherein Adam was before he had sinned; so the reprobate shall be in the estate that Adam and his posterity were in after the sin committed; saving that God promised a redeemer to Adam, and such of his seed as should trust in him and repent, but not to them that should die in their sins, as do the reprobate.

These things considered, the texts that mention ""eternal fire,"" ""eternal torments,"" or ""the worm that never dieth,"" contradict not the doctrine of a second and everlasting death, in the proper and natural sense of the word death. The fire or torments prepared for the wicked in Gehenna, Tophet, or in what place soever, may continue forever; and there may never want wicked men to be tormented in them, though not every nor any one eternally. For the wicked, being left in the estate they were in after Adam's sin, may at the resurrection live as they did, marry, and give in marriage, and have gross and corruptible bodies, as all mankind now have; and consequently may engender perpetually, after the resurrection, as they did before: for there is no place of Scripture to the contrary. For St. Paul, speaking of the resurrection, understandeth it only of the resurrection to life eternal, and not the resurrection to punishment.425 And of the first, he saith that the body is ""sown in corruption, raised in incorruption; sown in dishonour, raised in honour; sown in weakness, raised in power; sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body."" There is no such thing can be said of the bodies of them that rise to punishment. So also our Saviour, when he speaketh of the nature of man after the resurrection, meaneth the resurrection to life eternal, not to punishment. The text is Luke, 20, verses 34, 35, 36, a fertile text: ""The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage; but they that shall be counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: neither can they die any more; for they are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection."" The children of this world, that are in the estate which Adam left them in, shall marry and be given in marriage; that is, corrupt and generate successively; which is an immortality of the kind, but not of the persons of men: they are not worthy to be counted amongst them that shall obtain the next world, an absolute resurrection from the dead; but only a short time, as inmates of that world; and to the end only to receive condign punishment for their contumacy. The elect are the only children of the resurrection; that is to say, the sole heirs of eternal life: they only can die no more. It is they that are equal to the angels, and that are the children of God, and not the reprobate. To the reprobate there remaineth after the resurrection a second and eternal death, between which resurrection and their second and eternal death is but a time of punishment and torment, and to last by succession of sinners thereunto as long as the kind of man by propagation shall endure, which is eternally.

425 I Corinthians, 15

Upon this doctrine of the natural eternity of separated souls is founded, as I said, the doctrine of purgatory. For supposing eternal life by grace only, there is no life but the life of the body; and no immortality till the resurrection. The texts for purgatory alleged by Bellarmine out of the canonical Scripture of the Old Testament are, first, the fasting of David for Saul and Jonathan, mentioned II Samuel, 1. 12, and again, II Samuel, 3. 35, for the death of Abner. This fasting of David, he saith, was for the obtaining of something for them at God's hands, after their death: because after he had fasted to procure the recovery of his own child, as soon as he knew it was dead, he called for meat. Seeing then the soul hath an existence separate from the body, and nothing can be obtained by men's fasting for the souls that are already either in heaven or hell, it followeth that there be some souls of dead men that are neither in heaven nor in hell; and therefore they must be in some third place, which must be purgatory. And thus with hard straining, he has wrested those places to the proof of a purgatory: whereas it is manifest that the ceremonies of mourning and fasting, when they are used for the death of men whose life was not profitable to the mourners, they are used for honour's sake to their persons; and when it is done for the death of them by whose life the mourners had benefit, it proceeds from their particular damage: and so David honoured Saul and Abner with his fasting; and, in the death of his own child, recomforted himself by receiving his ordinary food.

In the other places which he allegeth out of the Old Testament, there is not so much as any show or colour of proof. He brings in every text wherein there is the word anger, or fire, or burning, or purging, or cleansing, in case any of the fathers have but in a sermon rhetorically applied it to the doctrine of purgatory, already believed. The first verse of Psalm 37, ""O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure"": what were this to purgatory, if Augustine had not applied the wrath to the fire of hell, and the displeasure to that of purgatory? And what is it to purgatory, that of Psalm, 66. 12 ""We went through fire and water, and thou broughtest us to a moist place""; and other the like texts, with which the doctors of those times intended to adorn or extend their sermons or commentaries, haled to their purposes by force of wit?

But he allegeth other places of the New Testament that are not so easy to be answered. And first that of Matthew, 12. 32, ""Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come""; where he will have purgatory to be the world to come, wherein some sins may be forgiven which in this world were not forgiven: notwithstanding that it is manifest there are but three worlds; one from the creation to the flood, which was destroyed by water, and is called in Scripture ""the old world""; another from the flood to the day of judgement, which is ""the present world, and shall be destroyed by fire; and the third, which shall be from the day of judgement forward, everlasting, which is called ""the world to come""; and in which it agreed by all there shall be no purgatory: and therefore the world to come, and purgatory, are inconsistent. But what then can be the meaning of those our Saviour's words? I confess they are very hardly to be reconciled with all the doctrines now unanimously received: nor is it any shame to confess the profoundness of the Scripture to be too great to be sounded by the shortness of human understanding. Nevertheless, I may propound such things to the consideration of more learned divines, as the text itself suggesteth. And first, seeing to speak against the Holy Ghost, as being the third person of the Trinity, is to speak against the Church, in which the Holy Ghost resideth; it seemeth the comparison is made between the easiness of our Saviour in bearing with offences done to him while he himself taught the world, that is, when he was on earth, and the severity of the pastors after him, against those which should deny their authority, which was from the Holy Ghost. As if he should say, you that deny my power; nay, you that shall crucify me, shall be pardoned by me, as often as you turn unto me by repentance: but if you deny the power of them that teach you hereafter, by virtue of the Holy Ghost, they shall be inexorable, and shall not forgive you, but persecute you in this world, and leave you without absolution (though you turn to me, unless you turn also to them), to the punishments, as much as lies in them, of the world to come. And so the words may be taken as a prophecy or prediction concerning the times, as they have long been in the Christian Church: or if this be not the meaning (for I am not peremptory in such difficult places), perhaps there may be place left after the resurrection for the repentance of some sinners. And there is also another place that seemeth to agree therewith. For considering the words of St. Paul, ""What shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why also are they baptized for the dead?""426 a man may probably infer, as some have done, that in St. Paul's time there was a custom, by receiving baptism for the dead, (as men that now believe are sureties and undertakers for the faith of infants that are not capable of believing) to undertake for the persons of their deceased friends, that they should be ready to obey and receive our Saviour for their king at his coming again; and then the forgiveness of sins in the world to come has no need of a purgatory. But in both these interpretations, there is so much of paradox that I trust not to them, but propound them to those that are thoroughly versed in the Scripture, to inquire if there be no clearer place that contradicts them. Only of thus much, I see evident Scripture to persuade me that there is neither the word nor the thing of purgatory, neither in this nor any other text; nor anything that can prove a necessity of a place for the soul without the body; neither for the soul of Lazarus during the four days he was dead; nor for the souls of them which the Roman Church pretend to be tormented now in purgatory. For God, that could give a life to a piece of clay, hath the same power to give life again to a dead man, and renew his inanimate and rotten carcass into a glorious, spiritual, and immortal body.

426 I Corinthians, 15. 29

Another place is that of I Corinthians, 3, where it is said that they which build stubble, hay, etc., on the true foundation, their work shall perish; but ""they themselves shall be saved; but as through fire"": this fire he will have to be the fire of purgatory. The words, as I have said before, are an allusion to those of Zechariah, 13. 9, where he saith, ""I will bring the third part through the fire, and refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried"": which is spoken of the coming of the Messiah in power and glory; that is, at the day of judgement, and conflagration of the present world; wherein the elect shall not be consumed, but be refined; that is, depose their erroneous doctrines and traditions, and have them, as it were, singed off; and shall afterwards call upon the name of the true God. In like manner, the Apostle saith of them that, holding this foundation, Jesus is the Christ, shall build thereon some other doctrines that be erroneous, that they shall not be consumed in that fire which reneweth the world, but shall pass through it to salvation; but so as to see and relinquish their former errors. The builders are the pastors; the foundation, that Jesus is the Christ; the stubble and hay, false consequences drawn from it through ignorance or frailty; the gold, silver, and precious stones are their true doctrines; and their refining or purging, the relinquishing of their errors. In all which there is no colour at all for the burning of incorporeal, that is to say, impatible souls.

A third place is that of I Corinthians, 15. 29, before mentioned, concerning baptism for the dead: out of which he concludeth, first, that prayers for the dead are not unprofitable; and out of that, that there is a fire of purgatory: but neither of them rightly. For of many interpretations of the word baptism, he approveth this in the first place, that by baptism is meant, metaphorically, a baptism of penance; and that men are in this sense baptized when they fast, and pray, and give alms; and so baptism for the dead, and prayer for the dead, is the same thing. But this is a metaphor, of which there is no example, neither in the Scripture nor in any other use of language; and which is also discordant to the harmony and scope of the Scripture. The word baptism is used for being dipped in one's own blood, as Christ was upon the cross, and as most of the Apostles were, for giving testimony of him.427 But it is hard to say that prayer, fasting, and alms have any similitude with dipping. The same is used also, Matthew, 3. 11 (which seemeth to make somewhat for purgatory), for a purging with fire. But it is evident the fire and purging here mentioned is the same whereof the Prophet Zechariah speaketh, ""I will bring the third part through the fire, will refine them,"" etc.428 And St. Peter after him, ""That the trial of your faith, which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ"";429 and St. Paul, ""The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.""430 But St. Peter and St. Paul speak of the fire that shall be at the second appearing of Christ; and the Prophet Zechariah, of the day of judgement. And therefore this place of St. Matthew may be interpreted of the same, and then there will be no necessity of the fire of purgatory.

427 Mark, 10. 38, and Luke, 12. 50

428 Zechariah, 13. 9

429 I Epistle, 1. 7

430 I Corinthians, 3. 13

Another interpretation of baptism for the dead is that which I have before mentioned, which he preferreth to the second place of probability: and thence also he inferreth the utility of prayer for the dead. For if after the resurrection such as have not heard of Christ, or not believed in him, may be received into Christ's kingdom, it is not in vain, after their death, that their friends should pray for them till they should be risen. But granting that God, at the prayers of the faithful, may convert unto him some of those that have not heard Christ preached, and consequently cannot have rejected Christ, and that the charity of men in that point cannot be blamed; yet this concludeth nothing for purgatory, because to rise from death to life is one thing; to rise from purgatory to life is another; as being a rising from life to life, from a life in torments to a life in joy.

A fourth place is that of Matthew, 5. 25: ""Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing."" In which allegory, the offender is the sinner; both the adversary and the judge is God; the way is this life; the prison is the grave; the officer, death; from which the sinner shall not rise again to life eternal, but to a second death, till he have paid the utmost farthing, or Christ pay it for him by his Passion, which is a full ransom for all manner of sin, as well lesser sins as greater crimes, both being made by the Passion of Christ equally venial.

The fifth place is that of Matthew, 5. 22: ""Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be guilty in judgement. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be guilty in the council. But whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be guilty to hell fire."" From which words he inferreth three sorts of sins, and three sorts of punishments; and that none of those sins, but the last, shall be punished with hell fire; and consequently, that after this life there is punishment of lesser sins in purgatory. Of which inference there is no colour in any interpretation that hath yet been given of them. Shall there be a distinction after this life of courts of justice, as there was amongst the Jews in our Saviour's time, to hear and determine diverse sorts of crimes, as the judges and the council? Shall not all judicature appertain to Christ and his Apostles? To understand therefore this text, we are not to consider it solitarily, but jointly with the words precedent and subsequent. Our Saviour in this chapter interpreteth the Law of Moses, which the Jews thought was then fulfilled when they had not transgressed the grammatical sense thereof, howsoever they had transgressed against the sentence or meaning of the legislator. Therefore, whereas they thought the sixth Commandment was not broken but by killing a man; nor the seventh, but when a man lay with a woman not his wife; our Saviour tells them, the inward anger of a man against his brother, if it be without just cause, is homicide. You have heard, saith he, the Law of Moses, ""Thou shalt not kill,"" and that ""Whosoever shall kill shall be condemned before the judges,"" or before the session of the Seventy: but I say unto you, to be angry with one's brother without cause, or to say unto him Raca, or Fool, is homicide, and shall be punished at the day of judgement, and session of Christ and his Apostles, with hell fire. So that those words were not used to distinguish between diverse crimes, and diverse courts of justice, and diverse punishments; but to tax the distinction between sin and sin, which the Jews drew not from the difference of the will in obeying God, but from the difference of their temporal courts of justice; and to show them that he that had the will to hurt his brother, though the effect appear but in reviling, or not at all, shall be cast into hell fire by the judges and by the session, which shall be the same, not different, courts at the day of judgement. This considered, what can be drawn from this text to maintain purgatory, I cannot imagine.

The sixth place is Luke, 16. 9: ""Make ye friends of the unrighteous mammon, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting tabernacles."" This he alleges to prove invocation of saints departed. But the sense is plain, that we should make friends, with our riches, of the poor; and thereby obtain their prayers whilst they live. ""He that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.""

The seventh is Luke, 23. 42: ""Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom."" Therefore, saith he, there is remission of sins after this life. But the consequence is not good. Our Saviour then forgave him, and, at his coming again in glory, will remember to raise him again to life eternal.

The eighth is Acts, 2. 24, where St. Peter saith of Christ, ""that God had raised him up, and loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible he should be holden of it"": which he interprets to be a descent of Christ into purgatory, to loose some souls there from their torments: whereas it is manifest that it was Christ that was loosed. It was he that could not be holden of death or the grave, and not the souls in purgatory. But if that which Beza says in his notes on this place be well observed, there is none that will not see that instead of pains, it should be bands; and then there is no further cause to seek for purgatory in this text.",misc

Like somebody singing over a fucking dubstep song
I spit like H&K with no B
S I put the vest on my chest and proceed to test the rest with the spray
Find the coackroaches who gonna run away cuz they gonna rue the day
They gonna pay for messin' w/ D the Brave, heh, silly kanve
May be a peasant but I'm puttin' in the work
One day my name's gonna rise from the dirt
But I ain't jumpin' into the main stream, and drown
Always gonna be a couple copies in stores, I'm down
Look at them metaphors, up above, cannonballs
I just want a good girl, not tan and all
Made up, like KDot said no make up
But for a different reason, girl don't commit treason
Don't sabotage, just stay up in the clouds with me
Because I'm happy now, 'cuz I just rescued the queen

What offends your tiny eyes
Will become something you like

For this life is too long
And this world has been wronged
By sinners and saints and more

Just for today

Why don't you stay?
Just for today

I watch my bones dry and shatter
For what purpose do they serve?
I don't feel that I can keep them
I don't feel that I deserve
To feel human for an hour
Or even for a minute
While I'm crying with the saints
And I'm laughing with the sinners

By Eagles who at once did cry their lonely call from darkening skies
And yet the grey child did survive, the thousand fathom fall to earth
And thus an empire great was built upon the blood of untold numbers
Spilled, forever in the name of Rome:
And when they brought both sword and brand unto our Isle, our motherland
There didst so rise our goddess bright with burning eyes
Whose anger bought such dread and clamour; striking fear unto the foe
Purge the unclean through fire and cross
Impale the heretics, desecrate their gods
Burn out the memory of the whip-scarred backs
And the years we spent beneath the heel

We march upon the wings of night, with deadly blessing, ’gainst the blight that dwells
Within the once strong walls of great Camuludonum

The infants cries and warriors screams
The sound and airs do haunt the dreams of the distant tyrant as he cowers
Behind the outstreched bloody arm of war

Screams heard in the Senate House
The witch-tongue of the wild
When mothers rave and howl and crave: Their vengeance on their children dead, defiled
They put false trust in mighty walls in towers of indomitable stone

City boy in love with limelight
Trying guess if the times right
Always out when it seems to be dark night
I fell in love with the dark life
Big circle yo, got a lot of friends, but it seems to me that my night never ends
Whenever I say I love her, yo, it's just pretend, cause the girl I loved before her made me scared to love again
A good little girl from the heart of the west
With a perfect little rep that put her far from the rest
Often stood alone and shed pass every test
Cause she'd always prove to me why she was always the best
Pretty green eyes, that hid all of her lies
I was so stupid, man I was so blind
It only took took time, for me to come and find, that she crossed every line, and she was always lying,and she wasn't who I thought
She isn't what I wanted, you got me feeling
Now my vision is so feel haunted
My patience was exhausted
You were suppose to come solve it
Instead you made me worse, should've known when it started
I wish it never was, I wish it would never be
I wish that it was sooner that i would come to see
That you truly had no benefit to me
And the worst things in life really do come free
All the emotion I invested
All my feelings that you messed with
Wrapped her neck with my own necklace
This is not what I expected
Never judge a book by the look of its cover
Never love a girl cause the words of her mother
Never thought you'd hurt me, but I guess your another
People always leave, shoulda known you were Gonna

I think that, we're a little bit to close, a little bit too close
For me
I think that, it might be time to go, it might me time to go
For me.. x2

[Verse 2]

Worst part is, we'll never know what could've been
Were growing up now, we're not really kids
Few years later we'll look back on all of this
Run into each other and probably reminisce
Talk about it all, see where we went wrong
Think about these times, when I wrote all these songs
Truly it was you who I based these on
I wish I could go and make you gone
I coulda put you on, and I coulda made you smile
I was all you needed, and you were always in denial
Know you didn't like my life style, but it was gonna change if you waited a while
But yourself selfish your greedy you're needy your helpless, you got no vision your blind I can't help it
All of these problems for me that you dealt, that's why in the end you'll be all by yourself
You're gone you're alone but I want you to know
Everything I did,look that wasn't for show
All the words that I spoke, and you still weren't sold, but truly the bullshit has really gotten old
You lied and you cried your sorry you don't mean, couple weeks later the same cycle was repeated
Consumed all my energy cause I always got heated
But now I realized that all wasn't needed
Walking back to your past where your dark times at
You almost made it to me but you tend to relapse
Then you always come around asking for another chance
But you'll do it once again so I guess I gotta pass
You're gone, you're a memory, I promise you'll remember me, time is a remedy, to cure all this energy
So goodbye forever
I know it's for the better, it's pretty damn sad, we woulda been great together

Over dollars and rocks, diabolical thots
The rush at the top, blood spills but paper's a mop
And I'm eager to cop me a bust down, guess it's time to chop
My brothers, do it for the gang shit
Those who know the handshake
The mac'll leave your brain split
I ain't scared nigga I'm anxious
Don't reload the clip, it's extended
Lil boy try to distinguish
Both voices, although they're candid
They both fucked up but you ain't near it
It is what it is man I gotta do this yuh
Ain't no fun being stuck in Luci's home
You know that a buck'll give me charm
You know that a buck'll do you wrong

You got the clout, you get a check
And that check is attention
Chances you got them, a handful
And clout'll turn them up against you
'Cause cats is really rats, they know how to talk
Yeah they know how to blend in
So focussed on today we don't care about a grandson
As long as we fucking and nutting in floral walls
In the hills or the Hamptons
We don't really get that far tho
It's best to stay cool like Junia Bardo
And Xen like we‘re EAZ yo

Gameboys with the big face, north Dade on the border

Fight through what you can't avoid

We kept in touch we visit him for like a couple months
Up out the year we fly to NY, just a couple runts
Flyin' all alone the chaperone would watch us from the front

Fam moved us to Hollywood
New kids, new schooling now
Didn't know not a single soul
I was nervous they would never cool it down, but
I skated in, I made some friends
Hey mama look at me
Nobody's dissin' on my thrift gear
Or my crooked teeth
I thought I fell in love a couple times
Well I was young and dumb
We broke into the old abandoned cinema for summer fun
I was still drug free
Learnin' to love me
Learnin' to stand up as a man
And grow to run, see
Them days were some scene
We stayed above sea
Learning to navigate the waves

Shoved down my little throat
Coughed it up with demonic dry heaves

Or else I might rot in hell

Save me, oh no no
You ain't gonna save me
Save me, oh no no
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save you but yourself

Back then I use to have the same
Nightmares most every night
Seized me up and made me scream
All the horrors that I hid inside
My mind was a web but I was both
The fly and spider that I so feared
Struggled but just got more tangled up
Fighting it after all of those years
But you ain't gonna save me
Save me, oh no no
You ain't gonna save me
Save me, oh no no
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save you but yourself

Sometimes I used to get this weird joy
Thinking I was gonna snap just like a rotten stick
Some simple demented pleasure keeping my feet
On the ground when the metaphoric mud got too thick
They said I was a bad seed with my head in the gutter
I'd softly mutter incantations to raise the living hell
They weren't far from being right
I took a rusty knife and I put it through the savior's heart myself

I learned that the day I seen my mom apologize
The hardest thing that I ever did was compromise
I swear the only dad I ever had was father time

When I got chills just from standing in your cold flame
Was so whack the day she left me for some no name

I know nothing lasts forever but why you gotta get rid...
Of the all time greats, the one that could of been stars
Even the school shootings have gone too far
It’s made life into something that has no value
So tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
I see life as a commodity, a thing to hold dear
It’s a shame that apathy has spread to my peers
I see a bunch of mourning for the dearly departed
Only for life to go on as if it were nothin’

For the loss of someone they cherish dearly
Everything has an impact, do you hear me
There’s no passing on, when you’re dead, you’re gone
And all you’ve got left is the memory of days forgone
But you can’t live in the past, you got to move on
For there’s no bringing it back, what’s done is done
So why is it hard for me to accept death
Cause once I die, there’ll be nothing left
Life will stop for me but it’ll keep going
I just have to hope that they won’t forget me

That this might be the end, it hasn’t gotten better

But I was wrong and I wonder, what will be left
Will we be doomed to live in a messed up world
Destruction, famine, and death like none foretold
I don’t want to see that happen, not in my lifetime
So I gotta stay persistent with that state of mind
This world is small, there’s only so many graves
The world’s gotta change, so we can live another day
Still I gotta give respects to those who have passed on
They provided the foundation which has remained strong
And I’m hoping someday I can give thy honor

And days slipping like that rapper Earl's covering lows
Cover girls coveting the simple time that we froze, in time idolizing moments she mumbling it’s your world when crumbling
Emotions no vocalists, not a trio to cover this
Deficits tumbling, like tumbleweeds, cut the shit
I tell me when tailoring to dysfunction this society publishing
The pain is so humbling, at times I'm amazed at the ways that stomach it
The phase is separation from all the days commeth
A maze that our sights see effected by rubbish that we created
The disdain embedded inside beloved
Yet we show it on our sleeves no denying it
Got to face it all to succeed or die trying it

To be here for a long time, pardon my lateness
And pressure make a diamond
Pray I make it count with these great gifts

[Chorus: Spq-Her]
When you're faced with adversity, remember, hold on
Life has its ups
Life has its downs
Remember, remember, straighten up your crown (straighten up your crown yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Remember remember (remember)
Remember, remember
Remember, remember
Hold on (hold on)
(hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
[Verse 3: Neak]
The world's changing, see the strangers
Scared of success cause old friends will see it, internalize it, the feeling’s raging
They say they love you but love you for what you’re doing for them
A thin line between clapping for em and seeming foreign
When you're appointed, apparent, the pressure boiling, symbolism for angel wings, flapping through life’s poison
Death around the corner, greatness allure her
The Malcolm/Martin/Kennedy saga continue on ya
Crazy when all you wanted was seeing California
Sadie I need, momma these demons run amok on ya
The hypocrisy of loving thyself, when sleeping with different souls and laying hearts on the shelf uh huh
This world's crazy yet we want what it got
We want whatever it gives, within forgiving me nots
Apologetic no, we just wanna live righteous
A sacrifice is coming when our life is priceless",rap

[Verse 1]
Oh how disgusting. All this disguising
To become somebody that’s worth existing

Oh it's repulsing. Fully engulfing
Every truth that ever
Found itself hiding

So join me!
Hey! let's play a lying game
And dirty ourselves
With something exciting

Deceiving, and heartless thieving
After all, life is so dull
Without some bleeding...

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on the masks and let's
Have us one last masquerade
Dancing senselessly
On the shadows of the betrayed

A smiling and crying and lying charade
Such is life for a boring...existence

[Chorus]
Cause I’m a liar! Liar!
And only that is true
After all fire, fire
Is something I pursue

Just call out ""Liar, LIAR!""
And I’ll infect you too
With the addictive taboo
Of bidding the truth adieu

[Post-Chorus]
Trust me! (that’s a lie)
Such a lie for a lie

You see, I can’t pry my
Own dyed scheming eyes

So please, forgive my
Falsified truthful lies
Truly! Lying!

(Cause I’m a liar)


[Verse 2]
Oh how appalling. The lies are crawling
And covering every single little bit

Oh how revolting, and full of loathing
It’s nauseating, exhilarating isn’t it?

Manipulating, hardly pulsating
A heart like that is the only one that’s free

Without emotion, without devotion...
It’s much easier to fake something happy

So join me!
Hey! Let's play a lying game
And cover ourselves
With something inviting

Rewriting, and truly driving
A story that was meant to
End with painful feelings
[Pre-Chorus]
Put on the masks and let's
Have us one last masquerade

Dancing senselessly
On the shadows of the betrayed

A smiling and crying and lying charade
Such is life for a boring...existence

[Chorus]
Cause I’m a liar! Liar!
And only that is true
After all fire, fire
Is something I pursue

Just call out ""Liar, LIAR!""
And I’ll infect you too
With the addictive taboo
Of bidding the truth adieu

(Cause I’m a liar)

[Bridge]
Peek-a-peek-a-boo!
Ha ha! I found you!
Hiding from the truth
(Well, it’s nothing new...)

Peek-a-peek-a-boo!
I can see right through!
Liars know liars
Like you know the back of your own hand

It’s bland

Such an existence
Where everything goes as planned

Wasteland

Is much more fun to
Navigate and understand

That’s why

I left it behind, my
World is covered in lies

That’s why

It seems there’s no
Longer blue in my sky so

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on the masks and let's
Have us one last masquerade

Dancing senselessly
On the shadows of the betrayed

A smiling and crying and lying charade
Such is life for the boring existence of a liar

[Chorus]
Am I a liar, liar?
Does it seem that way to you?
After all fire, fire
Is burning through the roof

Cause we’re all liars, liars!
And I don’t know what’s true
After all fire, fire
Has ravaged all I knew

I call out liar, LIAR!
But the world has gone askew
And there’s nothing else to do
Except bid the truth adieu

[Post-Chorus]
Trust me, what’s a lie?
Is it lies, only lies?

You see, I can’t pry my
Blind eyes while I cry

So please, forgive my
Blackened sky full of lies

Truly lying? Truly dying!

Now there’s no one who can help
I am up here by myself
In this social suicide called Rock and Roll
Bet the boys will have a laugh
When my voice breaks right in half
With my throat stuck to the wire of a microphone
Staring at the curtain it’s a dirty one
But the world is waiting on the other side
My body is an amplifier
And i am the string
Pick on me people pick on me
My nerves are taking us higher
Now the key
And my hands are shaking uncontrollably
Is it already over
Is it already over
Is it already over

Bend every memory in order to make em as straight
I like to stay there until midnight
Then i go to bed and lie with eyes wide open
Imagine that we are a clan descending from superman
Cousins of peter pan
All in all extraordinary
I can’t believe it’s true heroes in our living room
Looking just like me and you me and you
This family sure tells a story great
They tell the story great

In this family they say we’re pretty tough
But i’m not like them I tend to be first to give up

People start acting strange

Otherwise i’d become womanly
I can hear all that goes on in there

Like a man's supposed to
Baby, I don't wanna talk about it I just wanna be about it all night
Ride into the morning light
Keep it going for the rest of our lives
Girl, there ain't no way to say it any other way
So I'ma show you

[Bridge]
Show you every beat of my heart
Show you when you're wrapped in my arms
Show you with every kiss
Show you so you'll never forget

[Chorus]
I just wanna show you
That I know how to hold you
Like a man's supposed to
Baby, I don't wanna talk about it I just want to be about it all night
Ride into the morning light
Keep it going for the rest of our lives
Girl, there ain't no way to say it any other way
So I'ma show you
Whoa, I just wanna show you
Girl, there ain't no way to say it any other way",country
9616,"[Chorus]
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
In my chair
You sang these Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick

[Verse 1]
I don't even know what happened, I thought we was made for each other
She might be my mate but I love her
And I won't feel that way with another
When I first saw you, I was hypnotised
Something lost me in your eyes
I just want you back in my life
Just one more last kiss goodbye
That's why I'm writing this, because I know that I've lost you for good now
I never wanna live that love down
Every word you spoke was a good sound
I wanna cope with the stress but every time I see you in the street, I'm put down
I wanna get back with you somehow
But I think you're over our love now
Wow, I wish I was still with you
It's plain to see that I'm missing you
And you're a girl in the form of a drug and I'll never have enough of a fix of you
I'd kill for one last kiss from you
I even pictured that I'd live with you
They say wish upon a star, you're my star and you're up in the sky listening too
I don't like to dwell on the past but I miss whatever we had
And I'm gonna cling onto the love even though I know I'm not getting it back
You're a girl that everyone craves
I loved you in a definite way
I miss you loads and I'll tell you again
And I'll be the same 'til I'm dead in my grave
[Chorus]
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
In my chest
You sang these Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick

[Verse 2]
I see your face in my dreams
I dream that one day we'll be free
Free from the arguing and the fuss, 'cause I love you, I hope you stay with me please
I have dreams that you say them 3 important words and I say them back
I love everything about you I swear, the way you laugh and the way you act
She was beauty personified
When I see our pictures, I wanna cry
I hope what we had isn't gonna die
I wanna seem strong but I don't wanna lie
Now I'm here with a pen and a pad, while wiping the tears that fall from my eyes
Because I'm upset
And I'm in love with you and I don't think that I've had enough yet
So this is how love feels
I swear it feels so unreal
The love we had is fading away and the void in my heart is unhealed
I just don't wanna move on
Because I love I have for you is too strong
I'm here crying to my screen, looking at the first pic with me and you on
Deep, I don't like to dwell on the past but I miss whatever we had
And I'm gonna cling onto the love even though I know I'm not getting it back
You're a girl that everyone craves
I loved you in a definite way
I miss you loads and I'll tell you again
And I'll be the same 'til I'm dead in my grave

Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
In my chest
You sang these Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes

Goodbye my almost lover
Goodbye my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
And could you just let me be
So long my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should have known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do",rap

Until I'm almost mad
I must have roused the Devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad

I make a date for golf
And you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party
And the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains
Everything happens to me

I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool
Who never looks before she jumps
Everything happens to me
At first, I thought that you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air

I've telegraphed and phoned
I sent an airmail special, too
Your answer was goodbye
There was even postage, too
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me",pop

Funny last time you hit me up you were mad as fuck
Put up all my guards there’s just two of is
Last time you saw me you were like who is that?
I’m making moves while you are sitting down chasing nudes
All the same? Maybe not
Think the same,  no way
Rope a dope,  wordplay
Think it's easy, no way
In the zone,  all day
Give a fuck what you saying
Laughing now, everybody clapping now
Finally made a way and Ima take it all the way
I don’t care what you say ima get it anyways
I’ma take you out like it was just tennis
I’ma gonna make u remember my name

Problem
The human
Eye
Opens
At a rather late-stage
In the development
Of the individual
He has already
Done the most
Marvelous work
He will ever do
In a mysterious way
In his mother’s womb
He has built
A human body
And this body
Has organs
That are
Directed
To certain ends
And intentions
And these
Were not
The organs
Designed by reason
Designed by consciousness

The coming of the eyes
Into the general biological picture
Is very late

Hundreds of millions of years
Before eyes opened
And saw what was going on
Saw what life
Was doing
Now if you’ll see
And think
What it is
That life does
That life has to do in order to be life
It has to kill
And eat
Other life
That‘s the basic thing
This is a rather monstrous thing
And when the eyes see
What the
Situation is
On which its own life
Depends
Its own existence
When conscience
And consciousness
Become aware
Of the
Preconditions of their own existence
There is often
A sense of shock
A sense of horror
You know
The basic
Word of Buddhism;
All life
Is sorrowful
That’s one way
Of recognizing this
There is also the feeling
Many have of guilt
Simply for being alive
This is
In a way symbolized in the image of the fall in the Garden
Life
Is monstrous

A lack of focus
But I treasure such a simpler time
Young and bold
A light that’s slowly fading
Who’s right to question why?
When it flayed our innocence, then so swiftly resigned
My sight’s leveled again
An eternity, but who’s counting?
So I’ll call you the culprit
But the damage is done
Complicated, I’m sure
But forgiveness always finds a way to run
Your burdened mind
Maybe could have healed with just a little time
So we’ll seek out some closure
For the ones who never said goodbye

VERSE  1
IT’S A HEART of man not a heart of a stone
Happening everything near ma eye for the sake of a crown
Of a mother of a man WHO PLEADS FOR HIS LIFE
But a  Devil in front of him who mocks and Ends his plight
It’s a land of Muslims gotta name of PALESTINE
It’s better if  I change it with the name of blood line
Here people are starved of food and deprived of sunshine
Hey devil you can’t suppress our fight by cutting our life line
It’s  a  REOLUTION which  has already begun
Not against the forces but against whole of sources
You were proscribed to come in our land
Then what’r  u doing here WITH GUN IN YOUR HANDS
Got our homes spilled by your BOMBSHELL AND MISSILES
Ma gosh will do same with you i challenge you Israel
Galvanised ba principles of   ISLAM AND HUMANITY
Strong critics of Israel America you can call me AS YOUR ANTI
You can’t make us bother  BA KILLIN’ SISTA BROTHER’S
Don’t you remember your sons and your daughter’s
Can’t collapse like a wall BEING TRAPPED IN A BLUNDER
Propelled ba  your acts now WHY YOU CALL ME A BOMBER

VERSE 2
Your crimes on us we know you can’t be prosecuted
Coz institution like UNITED NATIONS are yours deputed
Having so much power in your hand in your grip
A horrible war crime was done in Gaza strip
By isrelian army who arrived with their war ships
Killed every innocent who came in front of them
Not even spared little babies and kids
Ma chest burns out hearin’  cries of a mother
Who lost his belief and tauramatised ba disorder
Hospital full of corpse  and eyes  full of tears
Every one in Palestine livin’ their life in fear
Whole world has turned blind to the cause which is clear
Ain’t no body alive to fight against the iced
These are those people who crucified Jesus Christ
It’s our land and it’s our legacy
Will lay down our lives for this land coz we are crazy
Made their lands a rich man vision
By making Palestine a poor man prison
By blocking our aids ba takin’ our lands
Now no more injustice coz I’m gonna mad
I will take a shit  and wipe it wid their flag
Lost many brother who were not been so younger
I’m a revolutionary motivated ba ma hunger
Propelled ba your acts now why u call me A BOMBER
For one isrealian death THEY KILL 25 PALESTANIANS
Revealed ba your NEW YORK TIMES shit on you isrealians
VERSE 3
Making terrifying scenes of slaughtering son’s  and mom’s
No mercy on these people still throwing their bombs
Quest of mines to every human of this world
Jus open your eyes otherwise devil will take hold
Preacher united nations jus stop preachin’
Coz u are their puppets im nt  gonna listen
Palestinians  forwarded demand of STATEHOOD BID
Every time they reject to get out of this rid
BLOODY SUPER POWER AMERICA is ruled by Israel
In front of every1 talk eradicating evils
But at the back door policies not less than devils
Attacked many countries for sake of WAR ON TERROR
Bullshit on u lair it was to get their oils
Made their lands a safe man heaven and
Destroyed many lands like  a ghost dragon
Propelled ba your acts we are bound to resist
Ba converting ourselves to BOMBERS AND EXTREMISTS
Later came to know that u tagged us TERRORRISTS
Free Palestine is what I call ma dream
Let these people live like an ordinary human being
Weapons and armours take away all these shits
Every 1 please come forward to end this conflict
Join this revolution which I have already lead
I swear to god that i will fight till end
That day i will stop when i will be dead

I had a dream about you last night
We were together walking in the sunlight
You slowly reached down for my hand
You said you'd love me while you can
Then, I watched darkness cover up the whole sky
Then, tears fell from my eyes
I looked down and I was all alone
Then, I woke up holding your note
Don't you remember what you wrote?
Said, I'll always love you
And, you'll always be true
Baby, I need you
Yeah, I just really need you

I think back to the old me
And the way you used to hold me

Looking back now, I recall the sunlight
How it would sparkle in her eyes
And her very precious little cute jokes
Wouldn't be in the mood but they'd make me laugh tho
And the touch of her skin
I'll never feel that again
God, I know that I sinned
But, I made immense for all of those sins
So, please can I have her back again?
God, I just want her back again
Cause without her I'm in a dark place
And the exit leaves no trace
I wish I could see her cute face
She could lead me back to her place
All the memories we made there
She'd be in my arms
I'd be in her care
I wish somebody would've told me

She said she'd be with me even when I'm old
Now I'm sorta kinda losing hope
Cause, I think her love for me is running low
There's nothing I can do tho
Now I sit here all hopeless
I'm already heart broken
As I sink down to my knees, I just wish somebody would've told me

2032,"[Verse 1: Daddyphatsnaps & Sailorurlove]
Oh my god, what have we got in to
Keep your voice down, Mom is gonna hear you
What a front for an orphanage
You step inside the door and you're forfeited
She ain't care about us, only what our organs give
A smorgasboard of kids just to torture them
What that bitch didn't know we were born for this
The four of us can duel in a war of wits
But how we gonna run, our coordinates
Are known, shh, I can hear her put a cork in it
""Children, children, children"", it's like she never knew what normal is
She can't give away your life, it is yours to live, what you want to end up like her subordinates?
What Mother did to us is a mortal sin
We'll show we are much bigger than our origins, yuh

[Chorus: Sailorurlove]
Sleep my children, there's no use being brave
Your cleverness won't save you, I know you're all dismayed
You think there's something you can do, there's nothing you could change
Cause Mom knows best, and Mom knows there's no escaping your fate
[Verse 2: Sailorurlove & Daddyphatsnaps]
""You think you can leave
Your place is with me
What you gonna do out there?
You don't even know how to move out there, it's a tomb out there""
Whatever do you mean Ma
It's almost like you're following me Ma
This little dance that we're doing is a see saw
If you have a point we can stop all the sweet talk (what a Mother)
So you can stay alive, but it costs your children
We are all dead man, but we walk this building
With a sense of hope
You send them away and smile as they clench their throat
And when they beg and choke you backs turned
You're the only thing that we had and that burns, you gave us everything that you had and that's worse
Cause you're the only Mother I knew
Now I'll save this family like any brother would do

[Chorus: Sailorurlove]
Sleep my children, there's no use being brave
Your cleverness won't save you, I know you're all dismayed
You think there's something you can do, there's nothing you could change
Cause Mom knows best, and Mom knows there's no escaping your fate

[Outro: Sailorurlove]
Out there it's dark I swear
Secrets were made
To keep you cared for
In the end you're worth more
Take a breath, calm yourself
A poor thought out plan won't help
I refuse to pay the price of children with their hopes too high
Quiet down, shut your mouth, I'm gonna do this right
And I don't care what I have to do
I'll break all your legs if it works, I'll follow through!
Don't test me
A Mother's rage could easily get the best of me",rap

I'm going through
A plan to bear you down
I'm coming for you now
A taste for revenge

[Pre-Chorus]
In low tide dreads are cast aside
You know it's a bait but somehow
You strive to have a taste and chew
And you won't regret
Yet you know you're dead

And you said you never ever
Give up till you're done
Then you want some more, still more
All the things you hate, all the things you hide
They will hunt you down

I step across the line
And turn another page
There's nothing I can fear now
Not a thing
It's a flight or fly position
I'm aching to get out of
Just with my bare hands
Aiming to the core

[Pre-Chorus]
In high tide waves are rushing in
I guess they just take you by storm
And every little thing you do
Trying to stay afloat
Will just drag you down

And you said you never ever
Give up till you're done
Then you want some more, still more
All the things you hate
All the things you hide
You will face them all

I'll warn against the industry, sell out scorn imagery
A war among the infamy, shell out sworn infantry
Store the young inner me, yell out torn enemies
I was battling my way up, from the underground
Tryna grapple stayin' tough, crumbs got me downed
These cattle not awake enough, bums with a crowns
Snakes rattle breaking stuff, sums when you not around
No turning back, just from learn from that
Realize where the earnings at, your burning track
Art of facts, real eyes see the artifacts
Smart attracts, be wise for the conscious acts
Always looking forward, never backward in regret
Afraid of my reflection look-in back at me, and yet
It trys to pull me in the cracks, so I could reflect, dam

Evil tropes to feeds the goat

It's better to do things the harder way, you carve a lane
Writing better then what scholars say, at Harvard mane
Knowledge gained, And I don't care what dollars say
Homage paid, so I don't care what the comments say
I'm not a slave, not afraid my pen & pad is a slave

Your eyes cannot shove

Glowing at last a piece inside

Unclean minds new generations birth right

And your blondie boyfriend wore a studded collar

4298,"(VOLUME III: MARIUS; BOOK VI: THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS)

Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing, we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, ""his Ursule"" caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk. A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed Marius' bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was following them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul.
All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably charged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the fawns of Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of Isis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape appeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.
The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubled motion, but he was none the less angry for all that. He was alone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one there. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehend such a thing? What she had just done is horrible!—Alas, the poor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to be vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, and takes possession of it, even without any right. Moreover, setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.
When ""his Ursule,"" after having reached the end of the walk, retraced her steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which Marius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and ferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising of the eyelids, which signifies: ""Well, what is the matter?""
This was ""their first quarrel.""
Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one crossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that relic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between that wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy.—""Perhaps he was there!"" he said to himself; ""perhaps he saw!""—And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.
With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius' wrath against ""Ursule,"" just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally pardoned her; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three days.
Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passion augmented and grew to madness.",misc

The gale, that o'er yon hills flings softer blue,
And wakes to life each bud that gems the glade,
I know; its breathings such impression made,
Wafting me fame, but wafting sorrow too:
My wearied soul to soothe, I bid adieu
To those dear Tuscan haunts I first survey'd;
And, to dispel the gloom around me spread,
I seek this day my cheering sun to view,
Whose sweet attraction is so strong, so great,
That Love again compels me to its light;
Then he so dazzles me, that vain were flight.
Not arms to brave, 'tis wings to 'scape, my fate
I ask; but by those beams I'm doom'd to die,
When distant which consume, and which enflame when nigh.

Nott.

Wakening the flowers that paint this bowery glade,
I recognise it by its soft breath still,
My sorrow and renown which long has made:
Again where erst my sick heart shelter sought,
From my dear native Tuscan air I flee:
That light may cheer my dark and troubled thought,
I seek my sun, and hope to-day to see.
That sun so great and genial sweetness brings,
That Love compels me to his beams again,
Which then so dazzle me that flight is vain:
I ask for my escape not arms, but wings:
Heaven by this light condemns me sure to die,
Which from afar consumes, and burns when nigh.

Tell me you can read my mind, even if you can’t
It’s something deep inside my heart, unlock it and I’ll give it to you

That’s for real, trust

Chip on my shoulder, want me to hold ya, I got trust issues know you got me too

In which I cannot seem to fit
Life on autopilot mode
While I restlessly look for an exit

Everything changes
All I feel becomes so sore
As I read the final pages
Suddenly yearning for

Sommething more
Than suffering, blood tears and war
'Cause dying's not enough
Something worth living for
Something worth dying for

Don't know
If this life is enough
Or if the journey doesn't end in more
Nothing more
Nothing more
Than a last breath for us to long for
Don't know if dying is enough
It's not enough
It's not enough
For me at all
To find a reason to go forth
When everything is bleak at most
Repressing thoughts of loathe
And every other dark and lonely feeling that you host

Until the day we all leave
Secretly wishing to achieve

Something more
Something worth living for
Something worth dying for",rock

But I will bring the hell to ya

And flight 77 crashed into the pentagon
But maybe its all a hoax
Easy way to kill the folks

As we elope thier countries in a marathon

You better get your walliet out

Where the chefs always swag it

Its good enough to make a prude chick
Suck her dads dick
With a smile and while he gets the two licked
And its bad but good like a shit covered tulip
Im a poet nigga with the two lips

While you steady try to become the race
Of alpha lyricists who will put a swoosh to ya face

So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal

There was a day when somebody introduced me to You
And You breathed Your life in me
You set me free...

That I'm not the same that I used to be
I believe in God, believe in God
I'm not ashamed to talk about it
To a world that slowly slips away
That I believe in God, believe in God

Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way
I've got a friend, I've got a love that's never gonna let me go
Since You gave Your life for me
You set me free...

That I'm not the same that I used to be
I believe in God, believe in God

It's all gonna be okay
Oh, when my emotions flow
He comes to sweetly say

Sick in that low-grade continuous way that makes you forget
What it's like to be well. we have never in our lives known
What it is to be well. what if I were coming home, I think
From doing work that I loved and that was for us all, what
If I looked at the houses and the air and the streets, knowing
They were in accord, not set against us, what if we knew the powers
Of this country moved to provide for us and for all people—
How would that be— how would we feel and think

It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

[Billy Danze]
Uhh M DOT, O DOT, we still hard with it
Yo' block, his block, we still armed with it
While y'all stopped hip-hop, we moved on with it
Got it on with it, spit it and rung alarms with it
And nowadays I've aged, so I'm calm with it
But I'm the reason Flex started droppin them bombs with it
Up by the club love thugs that's war with it
While the homies in the hood decided to go on, get it
And no, I ain't change lanes on you lil' dudes
I just upgraded my game on you lil' dudes
FOUNDATION - a whole different set of rules
Premeditation you facin predicates fool
You better be cool, I give you the WOMP WOMP
I go in the glove box and WOMP WOMP your top

And cleared all complications

Still, you are the last generation
So for the continuation
We, do what we do for the next generation
We, made it easy to trace it, we back with the basics
It's hard to replace it - you know exactly what it is

[Lil' Fame]
Run 'em down, gun 'em down, it's crazy when we come around
It's Fame from the underground, 200 and somethin pounds
You know my motto, both arms covered with body art
Don't catch a hollow, we keep arms, fuck a bodyguard
Let me remind you, how I do
If you think I'm just spittin a rhyme nigga you sick as the swine flu
Cause this ain't rap dummy, you get your fuckin face clapped
And they gon' have to fix yo' face back with putty (BOOM)
Get it ugly (BOOM) we do it 3-6-5
+Day 'N Nite+ but I ain't Kid Cudi, it's
M.O.!! Spittin devious thoughts, I'm from where niggas'll

Where they hustle hard, tryin to get the keys to the Porsche
Just some of them young boys do it for no reason at all cause

I still lose count counting my blessings
Sold dubs at my gigs, pain is the essence
Now I'm making hits, taking them hits made me a weapon
Uh, I never had a pot to piss in
Now I piss in a pot of gold and watch it glisten
In a race with my own race, that's not the mission
That's why I'd rather link WSTRN than cop a Smith &
Every time that top was missing, I went missing
Came back and left the old me, my friends miss him
How am I gonna stay the same tryna make a difference?
Tryna make a living, then make a killing and live killing shit
I mind my business cuh my mind's on my businesses
Kicked out of business studies, studied my businesses
It's kind of crucial what Ms. Simmons did
I've got away with words, a way with words cause I'm a lyricist
Mumma needs a new stove so I do stove
Could have got sectioned, I had to do road
And now I've got some new dough off a new flow
Couple diamonds, I can kill one bird with two stones

Though I'm in Tommy Hilfiger, still a real nigga
Yeah, my plan A was my plan B
I only planned my A levels for my family
And now I'm with a bad bitch and some bad breed youts
Even though I can't change them, I can teach
The things we used to do for figures
Now I do a one show and that's a new four figures
I can go forever and a few more minutes
I'm just tryna paint pictures, I don't do this for the image
I do this for the broke niggas
Not the 'lose a little hope and it's over', they're some joke niggas
I don't dodge my old women
Cause there's nothing wrong with gold diggers
When you dig for gold with your own niggas
Shining, from the ground up, we was grinding

They filled my dreams, they made my world
If I had moved less awkwardly
They might have had their way with me

They made me weak, they made me stare

I was the only one I ever had
And they possessed the world's delights
Espresso mornings, lasagna nights

The Italian girls
They made my world

They were strong and they were proud
Some were sweet and some were loud
They'd fill me up with what they'd cook
And put me down with just one look
I followed them through summertime
I made them laugh, I made them rhymes
But they left me there for other ones
Who had the dough when day was done

Just one thing keep me free
They were not in love with me

Now they've married and gained some weight
But that weight I appreciate
For it's the work of all those meals
And what you eat is what you feel

3019,"Few universally accepted conclusions have been reached regarding Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness; one rare given that can be stated is simply that it has never stopped receiving critical attention ever since its first publication in 1899. Deconstructionists revel in what is arguably that which makes Heart of Darkness so lastingly intriguing: the practically ungraspable, ever-shifting and self-undermining nature of its meaning(s), a great deal of which can be attributed to the presence of irony and parable.

[Footnote: An overview of recent theoretical approaches to the novella can be found in Ross Murfin's third edition of the work, from the “Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism” series, also including Conrad's complete text which is quoted from in this essay. For close analyses of a specific component, see for instance Nidesh Lawtoo, “A Picture of Europe: Possession Trance in Heart of Darkness”, or Darrel Mansell, “Trying to Bring Literature Back Alive: The Ivory in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness”.]

Ross Murfin explains that irony “causes us to apprehend something profound about the human self: namely, its capacity to understand or 'see through' others while remaining self-destructively ignorant about its own identity” (15); speaking in parable points to revealing features of everyday life which even “the multitude who lack spiritual seeing and hearing” can comprehend (Miller 231). The novella's combination of these has been said to allow for a deeper understanding of imperialist Europe's character more than that of Africa, perhaps even including a prophetic announcement of totalitarian regimes driven by charismatic leaders (see Lawtoo, esp. 427-429). Nevertheless, if communication via parable relies on the depiction of “real conditions of life” (Marx 476), and irony on an able audience that can decode its veiled intentions, it might be said that critics have been neglecting crucial judgments Conrad made relatively superficially in favor of those more deeply hidden. The allures of madness, otherness, primitivity and political implications seem to have caused a disregard of socioeconomic “conditions of life” represented within the text, which, I argue, lie at the very heart of all the aforementioned.

Many of the events in Heart of Darkness somehow revolve around the ivory trade (even though rubber was highly prized as well), providing the main lead for analyzing economic aspects to the story. Before Marlow starts telling his history to the others aboard the Nellie, the unnamed extradiegetic narrator mentions the Accountant “toying architecturally with the bones” of a domino set (18). That these dominoes are made of ivory forms only a part of the imperialist background of what could otherwise be an innocent game, for the word “toying” might allude to a lighthearted attitude towards the remains of an animal probably slaughtered—not to mention what people would have gone through to retrieve them. Just as relevant is the notion of the Accountant's playfulness being executed “architecturally,” considering the wealth amassed by Leopold II, king of Belgium during this exploitation of Congo, allowed him to construct or renovate many buildings, including the Royal Museum for Central Africa situated in Tervuren and Antwerp's imposing main railway station (InfoNu).

Yet ivory, inherent to Africa and only available in Europe through commerce,

[Footnote: For clarity's sake, it should be explained that Greenland—which still openly trades narwhal ivory—is usually considered part of North America, despite its ties with Europe.]

has a greater symbolic significance: it is that which the powers of the colonizing West had become economically driven by (if not somewhat dependent on), while relying for its harvest on those who they have generally portrayed as inferior. It is then ironic that, with their rightfully owned goods, Africans were in this sense supporting Europeans who nonetheless subjugated the natives and pretended to support them with civilization instead.

[Footnote: See the letter Leopold II sent to The Times of London (July 17, 1906) for an attempted justification of his colonial endeavors, contrasted by the negative criticism of the “Report of the British Consul, Roger Casement, on the Administration of the Congo Free State (1904)”. Also known as the “Casement Report”, this document signaled the native populace's situation becoming worse rather than improving under Belgian rule.]

Any possible sense of debt towards the colony and its people becomes erased within the novella too, as its white characters commonly treat ivory in a “toying” manner with subconscious disregard of its likely victims. As Laura Chrisman puts it, “Conrad’s text […] supplies a critique of the ways in which [the] metropolitan culture, and economy, is so totally yet casually involved in the process of imperialism” (26). The Accountant portrays this at the very beginning; Kurtz's Intended at the end, as the keys of her “grand piano […] with dark gleams on the flat surfaces like a sombre and polished sarcophagus” are presumably made of ivory (Conrad 90). This juxtaposition creates a cyclical structure, whereby Marlow's addressees (at this point of conclusion much more aware of the processes involved in bringing ivory to Europe) can return to look at the domino set and come to a very different assessment of its status.

These examples demonstrate how Marlow's narration functions as a parable. He may not be directly aware of why the instrument appears to him “with dark gleams,” but the “sarcophagus,” practically a coffin, always carries a connotation of death that does not fully escape his attention. Furthermore, this connotation creates its “sombre” aspect which cannot be “polished” beyond its concrete appearance, not unlike how, one might argue, the architectural feats issued by Leopold II—or any other achievements funded by “blood money”—cannot eradicate their historical taint through beauty. An everyday extralinguistic reality is thus infused with an underlying abstract sense, the unraveling of which requires no more than an attentive audience. To other characters of the story, however, ivory “finally becomes an amusette, as she [the Intended] can play upon the keys of the grand piano in the drawing room” and the Accountant toy with his “bones” (Mansell 213). To those who have not experienced first-hand the trade surrounding ivory, this material is a mere amusette or “plaything” (and perhaps it is therefore significant that “the Accountant” is exclusively described as such, rather than as someone in direct contact with the harvest). A lack of attention and interest causes the impossibility for them to regard their possessions in the same terms as Marlow does. Yet, if the meaning of the parable is lost to the Intended and to the Accountant, by contrast it only becomes clearer to the more knowledgeable reader.

The difference between a parable and any instance of irony mainly resides in the referents. Since a parable relies on the accurate depiction of “real conditions of life” (Marx 476) and adds new facets to them based on a wider insight into their origin and functioning, its “meaning […] contains the tale” (Miller 233). Irony (and indeed “[t]he consistent tone of Marlow's narration is ironical” [Miller 243]) is more self-sufficient in the sense that no such governing frame is required—only the linguistic expression itself (of potentially the most diverse categories) and a critical listener. Of this, too, Conrad early on provides an illustration: the narrator describes navigators such as Sir Francis Drake as
[h]unters for gold or pursuers of fame, […] bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth! … The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires. (19)

Contrary to a parable, an ironic expression continually runs the risk of misinterpretation. The Accountant's playing with ivory may be overlooked, but cannot be considered a reinforcement of that which it actually dismisses; here, however, “greatness” fueled by “the sacred fire” can be regarded as part of a positive view of imperialism. The word “germs” in particular manifests irony's “doubleness” (Miller 243), since it can be perceived neutrally as referring to the basis of the colonial enterprise, or negatively as containing a disease. Additionally, a link can be drawn between the “hunters for gold” mentioned above and those people that Marlow effectively set out with (and belonged to). When the Englishman asks one of his companions in the early stages of the journey why he came to Africa, this one replies: “[t]o make money, of course. What do you think?” in a scornful manner (35). Bearing in mind that the intradiegetic storyteller is making his observations retrospectively, it may be said that he views “the sword” not as one of justice, but instead of execution, and “the torch” as emblematic for chaos and arson rather than for enlightenment.

At least two aspects of what allows Marlow such ironic insight—what sets him apart from his companions strongly enough to provide for radically different judgments—are independent constituents of his personality (after all, “Marlow was not typical” [20]); the one hinted at first being his connection to the sea and how it influences his attitude towards others. As the unnamed narrator explains, “[b]etween us there was […] the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns — and even convictions” (18). This idea of tolerance linked to the sea (as Conrad himself may have experienced during his career with the merchant navy) points to a certain liberty of conceptions; if Marlow is neither defending his ideologies nor attacking those of others, he can pay all the more attention to understanding them. Moreover, he is described as “the only man of us who still 'followed the sea'” (19), or as the sole figure still embodying its permissiveness and maybe even a solemn tranquility that makes permutations all the more detectable, “for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself” (19). And as his “country [is] the sea” (19), no reticence due to patriotic or political loyalty can be expected on his behalf.

The second component of Marlow's personality that sets him apart from the masses is his disregard of particular social conventions, which thus ties into the aforementioned independence due to life at sea. “The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class” (19); with the concepts of class and social status being of considerable importance in 19th-century England, it appears safe to claim that his deviation from this norm is representative of a broader nonconformist approach to society's functioning. Still, it should be said that despite the attitude that generally sets him apart from other white people in the narrative, as also evidenced by giving “one of my good Swede's ship's biscuits” to (presumably) a young slave (32), Marlow too shows clear signs of prejudice. Even though he refuses to brand the native people as “enemies” or “criminals” (30), he does assume the African men aboard his steamer to be cannibals, and is taken aback by their show of “[r]estraint! I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me” (57).

Ultimately, most significant in providing Marlow with a different perspective is not his personality alone but rather his very journeying into the “heart of darkness,” especially when he meets Kurtz, who is both a negative indication of the issues of imperialism and an exponent of them (perhaps like the novella itself). Kurtz's morally deviant behavior is, to a lesser extent, present in other European characters as well. For instance, the “hairdresser's dummy” of an accountant who Marlow meets, “exhibited a gentle annoyance” at a sick agent being brought into his office. “'The groans of this sick person,' he said, 'distract my attention'” (32-33), slightly unveiling a disregard for the suffering of white people as well. What drives Kurtz's lack of empathy and the flaunting of his power—both exemplified by the shrunken heads displayed on stakes in what he has claimed as his territory (73)—beyond these  “acceptable” (within this setting) limits, is in fact the ambition he is otherwise lauded for. “Kurtz has not ‘gone native’ to the extent that he rejects a monetary economy and pursues only naked power and/or unspeakable rites for themselves. As much as Kurtz hungers for ivory, he hungers for metropolitan recognition, and status” Chrisman maintains (34), but it may very well be precisely that ivory which should lead him to the more abstract profits.

In light of Kurtz's lust for ivory and the wealth this was supposed to lead him to (both materially and in terms of social standing), the “horror” he finally exudes (85) is arguably, in all of its aspects, spurred on by the Company. The manager and his uncle seem to refer to this in affirming that “[t]he danger is in Europe” (47). Furthermore, those adjectives Marlow ascribes to the Company's atmosphere (“ominous,” “eerie,” “uncanny,” and most conspicuously “fateful” [25]) can be said to be equally applicable to Kurtz himself—the man Marlow looked almost destined to meet among “mean and greedy phantoms” (84). Upon his death, “[a]ll that had been Kurtz's” is simply summed up as “his soul, his body,” and then notably “his station, his plans, his ivory, his career” (89); thus the only “possessions” that are truly his, the soul and body, are merely mentioned briefly and also inscribed within the chain of that which is governed by the Company. It is additionally noticeable, when Marlow signs up to work for this enterprise (which is possibly not bestowed a proper name in order to appear more as a prototype than as a specific institution), that the secretary with the “compassionate expression” (24) is very much aware of the impending danger but issues no explicit warning. When he is asked why he is not “going out there” himself, he responds coolly by saying “I am not such a fool as I look” (26). Shortly after, it is telling that the doctor should inquire about “madness”. The idea that the Company is consciously sending people to their destruction in return for (and with the promise of) money, becomes all the more reinforced with the salute Roman gladiators would use: “[m]orituri te salutant” (25).

[Footnote: “We who are about to die salute you” (Latin).]

Notwithstanding, if many of the Company's employees figure as simple servants (even though they in turn employ slaves), it is not only the yearning for money that makes them go to such lengths. “Principles?” Marlow stipulates, “[p]rinciples won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags — rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief” (51). What this belief exactly is, seems only to be revealed through characters' actions. That is to say, it is the ideology that white people are serving a superior institution, that they have a right to harvest ivory and the ability to use the earnings more efficiently, that impulses them in their focus on profit. The Company's chief accountant saying that “one comes [emphasis added] to hate those savages” (34) might allude to racism not being a natural given, but rather a systematic growth within the conqueror—a sentiment eventually supported by businesses in order to ensure their continuing gain. Marlow is quick to notice the “philanthropic pretence” of the entire colonial endeavor, and that “there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick” (39), or, in other words, that none can ultimately escape a sufficiently present temptation.

However, Kurtz himself appears not to give in entirely to this “philanthropic pretence” and its associated racism, nor to its “savage” opposite, for he diminishes the former through his closeness to the native people and the latter by not renouncing his craving for ivory (in which sense he is still serving the Company). Since he belongs to neither of these extremes, he is launched into one of his own, and this stance between two possible types of conformism may explain his psychological liability. Kurtz's erratic and completely nonconformist behavior could stem from his extended insight into both worlds: having an independent point of view (not unlike Marlow), he can view the violence in Africa and the European greed that brought it about in their entirety. A profound implication that can be drawn from this is that Conrad chose the specific setting of Heart of Darkness not to make judgments about this locale (and it could be because of this that it remains unnamed), but simply for the pragmatic reasons of knowing it through personal experience and providing a strong contrast to Western European society that can allow the characters, and the audience, to reveal otherwise disregarded truths surrounding its functioning. “The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much” (Conrad 21), so what Conrad obliges Kurtz, Marlow, and the latter's listeners to do, is precisely to look into it as much as possible.

In summary of what these “otherwise disregarded truths” are, we can retrospectively ascertain that Conrad's use of irony and parables points to turmoil in Africa stemming from greed and a lack of conscious action on behalf of Europeans and their businesses (specifically “the Company”). In this sense, while racism is indubitably present within Heart of Darkness, it mostly serves to negatively portray its white characters, as political and socioeconomic judgments that can be discerned from the novella are much more critical of the West than of the colonized areas.

Your soul was rich when you were broke
Got a taste of fame and your rich soul choked
Ironic huh, It's like a joke
One that you rarely think, and never spoke of
Why should you man, people love you?
After years of bottom you got to climb through
But don't forget what got you there
It was the strife and the loss of cared

And what's affecting all of mankind
Respect the past and embrace the future
Live your life like you got a tumor
It's a shame no one will hear this song
The music biz has got it wrong
Unknowns spitting thick and genuine
While big shots see through like gelatin
I'm not one to call out names
But I'm talking to you Soulja, Waka, and Wayne
You've given the rap game a bad name
It's a shame, without fame, you'd feel your hearts flame
But now the light has gone dark
And greed has replaced the warm spark
So thanks to you, and saviors like Cole, Cudi, Lup, I can't make my mind up about rap and now I'm...

That really hurt me feelings, that's some bullshit!
Man, long time no see. Son of a bitch!
Alright

It isn't often that I have some competition
You rappers got positions but get blasted often quickly
It's been a minute since Christian Mims has uttered a word to me
But dissing replenishes mental weapons from the herbary
Why you such a hater, homie, got some extra words for me?
You think that bullshit diss you written stops and makes shit worse for me?
All you and your puppets ever did was misinterpret me
I've tried to show you my capabilities not concerned with beats
And when you get in front of me, you're making fun of me?
Saying I'm claiming the living I wanna be, and it ain't honestly?
I've done this shit since back in elementary school
Just writing rhymes while my peers just slept in their drool
You're mentally fooled, give me something rememerable
Give me a tool, then I'll show you how pretenders have rules
So you've been calling my bluff since you was all on my bus
I heard you hollering ""cunt"", putting it all in a blunt
You just ain't scaring me homie, you got no clarity, broski
This is my house and I'll be damned if i don't stand up to phonies
I keep recalling on an afternoon, waiting for the buses
Your little posse was passing me and laughing so abruptly
And I looked behind my back and heard ""Trailer Gang!""
I only laughed cause your ignorance is plain as day
So take aim, say names, play games, you don't gotta hate on me
I'll still give you props if you deserve it cause you made some heat
But since you met me, who you think I am is fucking bay-lo-ney
I'm glad that it was dope, it's inspiration just to wake the beast
Obviously you saw me as an easy target
A couple years ago, I don't think you had even started
Bitch, I've been rapping since before I was a teen, and farther
So your hypothesis to slaughter me is three retarded
You can't accomplish it, your bars are not that gnarly
The only thing that you can out-do me in is an ollie
Just stand behind the counter top at Arby's
Them curly fries bound to be embossing your coffin out of the barbie
Your diss was kinda cute, man it was darling
For underestimating me, I'm 'bout to make you feel fucking retarded
What's up with that noise? Shit, don't you still live up the street from me?
Everytime I see you when I'm walking, you're passing peacefully
You're seeking beats? I bet Elliot would jack you off
You faggots actively pass us, and as you laugh, we scoff
""Stupid motherfucker"", like what is it that you were trying to accomplish?

2359,"When he went into Sonia's room, it was already getting dark. All day Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been waiting with her. She had come to her that morning, remembering Svidrigaïlov's words that Sonia knew. We will not describe the conversation and tears of the two girls, and how friendly they became. Dounia gained one comfort at least from that interview, that her brother would not be alone. He had gone to her, Sonia, first with his confession; he had gone to her for human fellowship when he needed it; she would go with him wherever fate might send him. Dounia did not ask, but she knew it was so. She looked at Sonia almost with reverence and at first almost embarrassed her by it. Sonia was almost on the point of tears. She felt herself, on the contrary, hardly worthy to look at Dounia. Dounia's gracious image when she had bowed to her so attentively and respectfully at their first meeting in Raskolnikov's room had remained in her mind as one of the fairest visions of her life.

Dounia at last became impatient and, leaving Sonia, went to her brother's room to await him there; she kept thinking that he would come there first. When she had gone, Sonia began to be tortured by the dread of his committing suicide, and Dounia too feared it. But they had spent the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each thought of nothing else. Sonia remembered how Svidrigaïlov had said to her the day before that Raskolnikov had two alternatives—Siberia or... Besides she knew his vanity, his pride and his lack of faith.
""Is it possible that he has nothing but cowardice and fear of death to make him live?"" she thought at last in despair.

Meanwhile the sun was setting. Sonia was standing in dejection, looking intently out of the window, but from it she could see nothing but the unwhitewashed blank wall of the next house. At last when she began to feel sure of his death—he walked into the room.

She gave a cry of joy, but looking carefully into his face she turned pale.

""Yes,"" said Raskolnikov, smiling. ""I have come for your cross, Sonia. It was you told me to go to the cross-roads; why is it you are frightened now it's come to that?""

Sonia gazed at him astonished. His tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.

""You see, Sonia, I've decided that it will be better so. There is one fact.... But it's a long story and there's no need to discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which I shall have to answer—they'll point their fingers at me.... Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. I'd rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I've become too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It's a brutal state to be in! Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?""

He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or concentrate his attention on anything; his ideas seemed to gallop after one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.

Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.

""It's the symbol of my taking up the cross,"" he laughed. ""As though I had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta's—you will wear yourself, show me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old woman's neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what matters; I'm somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you, Sonia, so that you might know... that's all—that's all I came for. But I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I am going to prison and you'll have your wish. Well, what are you crying for? You too? Don't. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!""
But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. ""Why is she grieving too?"" he thought to himself. ""What am I to her? Why does she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She'll be my nurse.""

""Cross yourself, say at least one prayer,"" Sonia begged in a timid broken voice.

""Oh certainly, as much as you like! And sincerely, Sonia, sincerely....""

But he wanted to say something quite different.

He crossed himself several times. Sonia took up her shawl and put it over her head. It was the green drap de dames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, ""the family shawl."" Raskolnikov thought of that looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia meant to go with him.

""What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I'll go alone,"" he cried in cowardly vexation, and almost resentful, he moved towards the door. ""What's the use of going in procession?"" he muttered going out.

Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.

""Was it right, was it right, all this?"" he thought again as he went down the stairs. ""Couldn't he stop and retract it all... and not go?""

But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn't ask himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike him then.

""Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her—on business; on what business? I had no sort of business! To tell her I was going; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I've sunk! No, I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what I would do! I am a beggarly contemptible wretch, contemptible!""

He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it went to the Hay Market.

He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. ""In another week, another month I shall be driven in a prison van over this bridge, how shall I look at the canal then? I should like to remember this!"" slipped into his mind. ""Look at this sign! How shall I read those letters then? It's written here 'Campany,' that's a thing to remember, that letter a, and to look at it again in a month—how shall I look at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am becoming a baby, I am showing off to myself; why am I ashamed? Foo! how people shove! that fat man—a German he must be—who pushed against me, does he know whom he pushed? There's a peasant woman with a baby, begging. It's curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here's a five copeck piece left in my pocket, where did I get it? Here, here... take it, my good woman!""

""God bless you,"" the beggar chanted in a lachrymose voice.
He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd, stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him, though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.
He suddenly recalled Sonia's words, ""Go to the cross-roads, bow down to the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say aloud to the whole world, 'I am a murderer.'"" He trembled, remembering that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....
He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed down a second time.

""He's boozed,"" a youth near him observed.

There was a roar of laughter.

""He's going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children and his country. He's bowing down to all the world and kissing the great city of St. Petersburg and its pavement,"" added a workman who was a little drunk.

""Quite a young man, too!"" observed a third.

""And a gentleman,"" someone observed soberly.

""There's no knowing who's a gentleman and who isn't nowadays.""

These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, ""I am a murderer,"" which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips, died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.

He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third storey. ""I shall be some time going up,"" he thought. He felt as though the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time left for consideration.

Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to collect himself, so as to enter like a man. ""But why? what for?"" he wondered, reflecting. ""If I must drink the cup what difference does it make? The more revolting the better."" He imagined for an instant the figure of the ""explosive lieutenant,"" Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually going to him? Couldn't he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch? Couldn't he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch's lodgings? At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the ""explosive lieutenant""! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.

Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office. There were very few people in it this time—only a house porter and a peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen. Raskolnikov walked into the next room. ""Perhaps I still need not speak,"" passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.
""No one in?"" Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.

""Whom do you want?""
""A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I've forgotten! 'At your service!'"" a familiar voice cried suddenly.

Raskolnikov shuddered. The Explosive Lieutenant stood before him. He had just come in from the third room. ""It is the hand of fate,"" thought Raskolnikov. ""Why is he here?""

""You've come to see us? What about?"" cried Ilya Petrovitch. He was obviously in an exceedingly good humour and perhaps a trifle exhilarated. ""If it's on business you are rather early.[*] It's only a chance that I am here... however I'll do what I can. I must admit, I... what is it, what is it? Excuse me....""

                [*] Dostoevsky appears to have forgotten that it is after
                sunset, and that the last time Raskolnikov visited the
                police office at two in the afternoon he was reproached for
                coming too late.—TRANSLATOR.

""Raskolnikov.""

""Of course, Raskolnikov. You didn't imagine I'd forgotten? Don't think I am like that... Rodion Ro—Ro—Rodionovitch, that's it, isn't it?""

""Rodion Romanovitch.""

""Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I've been genuinely grieved since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it's a genuine passion! Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius. As for a hat—well, what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what's under the hat, what the hat covers, I can't buy that! I was even meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you'd... But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your family have come?""

""Yes, my mother and sister.""

""I've even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister—a highly cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit—that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family's arriving?""

""No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find Zametov here.""

""Oh, yes! Of course, you've made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is not here. Yes, we've lost Zametov. He's not been here since yesterday... he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a feather-headed youngster, that's all; one might have expected something from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men. He wanted to go in for some examination, but it's only to talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it's a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and you won't be deterred by failure. For you, one may say, all the attractions of life nihil est—you are an ascetic, a monk, a hermit!... A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned research—that's where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself.... Have you read Livingstone's Travels?""

""No.""

""Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!""

""N-no...""

""Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself! Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say friendship is quite another? No, you're wrong! It's not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen.... You were asking about Zametov. Zametov will make a scandal in the French style in a house of bad reputation, over a glass of champagne... that's all your Zametov is good for! While I'm perhaps, so to speak, burning with devotion and lofty feelings, and besides I have rank, consequence, a post! I am married and have children, I fulfil the duties of a man and a citizen, but who is he, may I ask? I appeal to you as a man ennobled by education... Then these midwives, too, have become extraordinarily numerous.""

Raskolnikov raised his eyebrows inquiringly. The words of Ilya Petrovitch, who had obviously been dining, were for the most part a stream of empty sounds for him. But some of them he understood. He looked at him inquiringly, not knowing how it would end.
""I mean those crop-headed wenches,"" the talkative Ilya Petrovitch continued. ""Midwives is my name for them. I think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!"" Ilya Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. ""It's an immoderate zeal for education, but once you're educated, that's enough. Why abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common they are, you can't fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?""

""Svidrigaïlov,"" someone answered from the other room with drowsy listlessness.

Raskolnikov started.

""Svidrigaïlov! Svidrigaïlov has shot himself!"" he cried.

""What, do you know Svidrigaïlov?""

""Yes... I knew him.... He hadn't been here long.""

""Yes, that's so. He had lost his wife, was a man of reckless habits and all of a sudden shot himself, and in such a shocking way.... He left in his notebook a few words: that he dies in full possession of his faculties and that no one is to blame for his death. He had money, they say. How did you come to know him?""

""I... was acquainted... my sister was governess in his family.""

""Bah-bah-bah! Then no doubt you can tell us something about him. You had no suspicion?""

""I saw him yesterday... he... was drinking wine; I knew nothing.""

Raskolnikov felt as though something had fallen on him and was stifling him.

""You've turned pale again. It's so stuffy here...""

""Yes, I must go,"" muttered Raskolnikov. ""Excuse my troubling you....""

""Oh, not at all, as often as you like. It's a pleasure to see you and I am glad to say so.""

Ilya Petrovitch held out his hand.

""I only wanted... I came to see Zametov.""

""I understand, I understand, and it's a pleasure to see you.""

""I... am very glad... good-bye,"" Raskolnikov smiled.

He went out; he reeled, he was overtaken with giddiness and did not know what he was doing. He began going down the stairs, supporting himself with his right hand against the wall. He fancied that a porter pushed past him on his way upstairs to the police office, that a dog in the lower storey kept up a shrill barking and that a woman flung a rolling-pin at it and shouted. He went down and out into the yard. There, not far from the entrance, stood Sonia, pale and horror-stricken. She looked wildly at him. He stood still before her. There was a look of poignant agony, of despair, in her face. She clasped her hands. His lips worked in an ugly, meaningless smile. He stood still a minute, grinned and went back to the police office.

Ilya Petrovitch had sat down and was rummaging among some papers. Before him stood the same peasant who had pushed by on the stairs.

""Hulloa! Back again! have you left something behind? What's the matter?""

Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer. He walked right to the table, leaned his hand on it, tried to say something, but could not; only incoherent sounds were audible.

""You are feeling ill, a chair! Here, sit down! Some water!""

Raskolnikov dropped on to a chair, but he kept his eyes fixed on the face of Ilya Petrovitch, which expressed unpleasant surprise. Both looked at one another for a minute and waited. Water was brought.

""It was I..."" began Raskolnikov.

""Drink some water.""

Raskolnikov refused the water with his hand, and softly and brokenly, but distinctly said:

""It was I killed the old pawnbroker woman and her sister Lizaveta with an axe and robbed them.""

Ilya Petrovitch opened his mouth. People ran up on all sides.

Raskolnikov repeated his statement.",misc

I'm gonna give you hell
Alright

You're in my destiny
You can't be free
I'm harder than a rock
I hear you scream before salvation
You need mercy
I bet you're not
Bring me my rapture or your souls will be forever lost
[Pre-Chorus]
You need an answer
This is the answer
Who is the answer
I am the answer

Repay us all for falling
Deliver us from evil
Your destiny is calling
I'm gonna give you hell

My blood is cold
My voice is gone
My engines fuelled by metal
You have to steer yourself
You've got to get your act together
Do you want to go, believe in me
Or face the devil

You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night
You want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

[Chorus 1]
I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it (Prove it)

And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid
And you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do

And you'll discover baby)

[Chorus 2]
There's always something magic (There's always something magic)
There's always something new (New)

The beat is yours forever (The beat is yours forever)

Once upon a time was a backbeat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings
If you hold onto a chorus, you can get through the night

I treasure your love (Treasure your love)
I never want to lose it
And you've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

Cause where im from they throw #Gang sings

Walls talk im caught red handed
Cause Im touching them before the paint dry

All i ever needed was my team
And to be weeded

Where we sailing ain't no tellin
Better leave if you get sea sick

Found a dream they believed it
Lived it now we must repeat

Just Be loyal
Trust agreements
And Watch out for
Lust n demons
Facts i know a couple creepin'
Stack a Oz  rush the defense

Don't like help
Black Michael Phelps
Flow gold and achievements

Heard a penny for a though
So i need 3 cent

At times its hard to sleep
And be at peace
With random secrets

Steel city
Land of thieves
Cookin with the hands of Jesus

I can't breathe since
I done died
To many times

I swear the symbols come in sequence
Screaming  Rest in Peace Prince

Someone tell my family

I ain't plan to be this but

All these fake niggas, all they do is hate
Look at sus ass bitches, all they do is flake
Hit me up on snap, now they wanna be my friend
Nigga I don't play pretend
Drop top in the Benz and we smoking on this pen
Man fuck these kids, I would rather feel lonely
Me and the homies, real ones only
MCM backpack, fuck where that ass at
I don't got no FasTrak, she be on the Backpage with a fat ass
I'm paying it in bills, I need to relax, yeah I gotta fucking chill
Booty so thick and we did an earthquake drill
Cooking up the sauce on the outdoor grill
You're either born with it or it's acquired through the years
Overcome the fear in the Beamer, I'm tryna switch the gears
Nah fuck it, I'll just take an Uber
I'm a goofy goober, one day imma make it big, imma be a YouTuber
I don't know how to drive, I popped a 35
This drink just slowed my time
Friday night live and we feeling so alive
Smoking on the gas, we be getting hella lit in the high rise
Nigga went to the bathroom, took a piss like 9 times
Hector like a cat nigga, got like 9 lives
I had an issue with the key, kicked us to the curb
Do not disturb
Boutta slide over to the burbs, hit me up for favors, expect no return
Wait a couple minutes, we went back in, we just cashed in
Got the keys back, they think I'm on crack
They claim I just attacked, talking all this shit behind my back
Security guard nigga tryna square up
They can't go through me, I got LaFlare on
I don't need a cup of water, bitch who you tryna take care of?
I'm getting critical hits when I'm fucking on your bitch
I don't want no kids, no baby daddy shit
I'm lining up my fleet and we playing Battleship
Ice so frozen, got the Rollie on my wrist
Going from the Greeks to the Romans
Pussy so wet, it's like an ocean
World War II, Palestinians shot up by the Jews
Turn on the TV, what is the news?
I'm roaring like a lion in the San Francisco Zoo
Yeah, my nigga LaFlee
San Pablo to Richmond, going back across the bridge
All we do is hitting licks and exaggerating shit
Talk about the old days and my old ways
Now we popping tags and securing bags
Smoking on the medical, edibles
Doctors in the hospital treat me like a vegetable
Unethical, unacceptable
They say I need to chill out
It's hard to be humble with my 100 dollar bills out
I'm a slave to the money, dripping Balmain
I'm changed by the fame, just staying in my lane
I'm switching up the game",rap

To see how the story ended
Two left feet and a set complete

Even for the last of the wine

Singin' now -

Cause the curves and corners
Make my mind go slow
So bring the ol' sun down, we're coming out

You can never go back home

When your plans all turn to dust, yeah

Celebrate the lonely and the lame?""

'Gainst a rythmn and a good chord change.""

My god, where are you at, when I need you most?
I fell on down face first, and now I feel the curse
I been haunted, hunted by demons who come to push me and pull me
And while they rip me at the seams, I stress, I guess
Its bout time that I learn to confess to you
Recognize I’m blessed more than a lot, it true
All the while there’s, some-something weighing me down
I fought, bloodied knuckles, filthy hands for a crown
Build me up, make me whole, all I want is control
Slurred speech, limbs numb, broken soul, I’m unknown
This to the god in mirror, this bout my liquid-quick fix it
Bout the blur to my vision, and the depression I would swim in
I was drowning, sinking worse of the worst
At least that’s how I perceived, but I know now that the source
So this urge just to feel complete will no longer conquer me

[Hook]
That’s on God
That’s on Me
[Verse 2]
Bloody nose, sore feet, some eighty-hour weeks
Working two jobs with dope dealers preying at each
Now you tell me how you’d deal
They’ve got the powdered solution
I got to using to fight sleep and make them ends meet
Addiction can creep, it crawled and got me slow
Sucked me whole, it’s no wonder all a sudden lost control
Shit, but no one could know, ashamed to face a weakness
Fear to find another urge to drag and chain me to the deep end
In a feedback loop, press snooze, and load loot
You repeat that too much, I promise - you lose
I digress, and re-focus my breath, fill some air to my lungs
I’ve been a man, now a god I’ll become

That’s on God
That’s on Me",rap

Briefly, this is my testimony
I see genius in everybody
To perceive it in yourself is the difficulty

Where you come from really makes no difference to me
Whether country or just a lonely city

To produce flower and fruit simultaneously

It'll buzz you like a tweak on your nipple
Tickle your sensibilities, speak just a little
The words have enough weight to turn rock to metal

It manifests solidly if you believe
A rich creativity, fever pitch energy
And crazy synchronicity if you believe

Can’t  count on people

Getting woken up at 5 a.m
Warm blanket on my skin
Mama do what she gotta do
No other option
My father left the crib, so
Ain’t no babysitter
Single mother working full time
Take me to work with her
Lay me on the conference room floor so I can sleep
Gave me a pillow and a blanket
Told me “baby count your sheep”
Maybe that’s why till this day
I can never fall sleep
They murdered my cousin Israel
Papito, Rest In Peace
When my grandfather died
My mother cried to me
Said she felt all alone...
I had a lot of vices, I ain’t like where it took me
If I turned my life around, would they do me like I’m Tookie?
Met an angel who can keep me off of the depressants
I still got some demons, hoping she don’t second guess this
I’m always on the run, I’m always on the move
And if I ever fall in love, I bet that bitch be the truth
Like what

[Verse 2: Jae Flow]
I pray to God that he lay his hand upon us
Been alone for too long staring at 4 corners
My family never really had the best luck
I did my homework with no lights for a month
We ain’t have much, and we barely had each other
Music my peace of my mind and I doubt I’ll find another
Started to feel like I would never find a way
Find an escape, feeling like I’m dying every day
Made that move to NY, hoping time would fly by, I’m tired
Went to school for music, thought I’d set the world on fire
Hurricane Sandy hit the coast, I’m far from home
Once again I’m in the dark, once again I’m all alone
Dropped Fuck ICE and i finally spoke about it
I put on for my dawgs and my people who felt silent
May we all live long and our parent living lavish
For you I would die, I bleed on this canvas

Can’t count on weather
Can’t count on people

Hold-tight when we used to hold tight
Levitate to Most High and fuck up the whole skyline
Bright lights, I hope that feeling can replenish
Regretful, 'cause if I let you left me then I'll be rush rouletting
With a whole full clip in - pow, cashmere drippage now
And memories, lift me up, but still a man's tears dripping down
Onto these photographs of what we used to be
But over time, that puddle turns into a sea
When I observed you cry a stream
I was just surfing on your grief
The hurt I can't delete, just come to terms with who is me
But who are we? These mirrors don't reflect perfection
Just put on your crep selection, come on two-step to heaven with me

Come crashing through your door

I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl

Why’d you say that
Where are we at
I don’t know how to be with you
Why’d I say that
Where am I at
I don’t know how to act with you
They thought we were together
I never proved them right
I don’t know how to measure
What you do to me like

Your lipstick stains my cups
But you’re not around
You’re not around
Somehow I don’t give up
I don’t know how
I don’t know how
I think we’re getting closer
Now you’re so far away
Guess I should take it slower
Wait for another day

Every time you see me I'm different
I remember when I was just asking for your digits
Sometimes when I think, I don't miss it
Other times I think if you were gone and I can't take it
2k16 it was different
We were sitting all alone together in the basement
Three times had a chance, I ain't take it
I've been chasing too long I don't even think I like it
I'm over it, it's over
Or at least that's what I thought, I don't know though
Everything changes when you're over
Messing with my head, I don't even feel sober

Your lipstick stains my cups
But you’re not around
You’re not around
Somehow I don’t give up
I don’t know how
I don’t know how

So you sought out to make it routine
I thought being this numb was me toughening up
You stitched the back of your corduroys

I'm withdrawn from the ways that you are
Stuck in a dream state of the art
I went with my gut and I threw it all up
So dig your thumbs into my pressure points

You're always leaving the light on
I'm leaving before it gets bad
And if it's what you want
Why do you look like that?
I will bend over backwards
To keep what you've got here intact

Who will die in my lifetime?
You'd rather pass in your sleep

I'm losing my way with words
Sentences scattered and slurred
Hope the last brеath I breathe is a sigh of reliеf
With your past on a pedestal
Should I fall off of the face of the earth?
Or rinse with salt, just so it doesn't hurt?
I've said it once, said it twice
I've spoiled everything nice
Shutting down summer solstice
To make a shorter schedule

You're always leaving the light on
I'm leaving before it gets bad
And if it's what you want
Why do you look like that?
I will bend over backwards
To keep what you've got here intact, intact

If I treat every thought like a stab in the back
I will write out my last words
I'll save every wishbone you snapped
You snapped

You're always leaving the light on
I'm leaving before it gets bad
And if it's what you want
Why do you look like that?

Rhymes gotta last so i keep it all up in my dome
Signs of a past but i gotta keep it on my own
Vines in a mass keeping me from getting grown
So live in the present of life and it shows
There is no cost but just value it though
Life is so short and could be floored

Remember the pain remember the loss
Remember the hate remember it all

Our struggles could help someone else

Here by the riverside
I looked into her big blue eyes and loved her like rain
Then she flew away like the bird she was before

I saw her flying into the sunset
As the sky turned to black and she faded from view
Next morning by sunrise I watched and waited
Waited for the bird that was my angel within

But she never returned

And I'm still waiting
Where is she
Is she gone
Was she murdered by a man, thinking that she was just some bird?

All day long I sit by the riverside
Watching the sunrise and sunset
I'm waiting for my angel to appear
But I'll have to accept I'll never see her again
'cos she never returned

And I'm still waiting
Where is she",pop

Hating me melanin, saying me hella mean

1516,"Come, kings, and listen to my song:
When Gwin, the son of Nore,
Over the nations of the North
His cruel sceptre bore;
The nobles of the land did feed
Upon the hungry poor;
They tear the poor man's lamb, and drive
The needy from their door.

`The land is desolate; our wives
And children cry for bread;
Arise, and pull the tyrant down!
Let Gwin be humblèd!'

Gordred the giant rous'd himself
From sleeping in his cave;
He shook the hills, and in the clouds
The troubl'd banners wave.

Beneath them roll'd, like tempests black,
The num'rous sons of blood;
Like lions' whelps, roaring abroad,
Seeking their nightly food.
Down Bleron's hills they dreadful rush,
Their cry ascends the clouds;
The trampling horse and clanging arms
Like rushing mighty floods!

Their wives and children, weeping loud,
Follow in wild array,
Howling like ghosts, furious as wolves
In the bleak wintry day.

`Pull down the tyrant to the dust,
Let Gwin be humblèd,'
They cry, `and let ten thousand lives
Pay for the tyrant's head.'

From tow'r to tow'r the watchmen cry,
`O Gwin, the son of Nore,
Arouse thyself! the nations, black
Like clouds, come rolling o'er!'

Gwin rear'd his shield, his palace shakes,
His chiefs come rushing round;
Each, like an awful thunder cloud,
With voice of solemn sound:

Like rearèd stones around a grave
They stand around the King;
Then suddenly each seiz'd his spear,
And clashing steel does ring.
The husbandman does leave his plough
To wade thro' fields of gore;
The merchant binds his brows in steel,
And leaves the trading shore;

The shepherd leaves his mellow pipe,
And sounds the trumpet shrill;
The workman throws his hammer down
To heave the bloody bill.

Like the tall ghost of Barraton
Who sports in stormy sky,
Gwin leads his host, as black as night
When pestilence does fly,

With horses and with chariots--
And all his spearmen b 1000 old
March to the sound of mournful song,
Like clouds around him roll'd.

Gwin lifts his hand--the nations halt;
`Prepare for war!' he cries--
Gordred appears!--his frowning brow
Troubles our northern skies.

The armies stand, like balances
Held in th' Almighty's hand;--
`Gwin, thou hast fill'd thy measure up:
Thou'rt swept from out the land.'
And now the raging armies rush'd
Like warring mighty seas;
The heav'ns are shook with roaring war,
The dust ascends the skies!

Earth smokes with blood, and groans and shakes
To drink her children's gore,
A sea of blood; nor can the eye
See to the trembling shore!

And on the verge of this wild sea
Famine and death doth cry;
The cries of women and of babes
Over the field doth fly.

The King is seen raging afar,
With all his men of might;
Like blazing comets scattering death
Thro' the red fev'rous night.

Beneath his arm like sheep they die,
And groan upon the plain;
The battle faints, and bloody men
Fight upon hills of slain.

Now death is sick, and riven men
Labour and toil for life;
Steed rolls on steed, and shield on shield,
Sunk in this sea of strife!

The god of war is drunk with blood;
The earth doth faint and fail;
The stench of blood makes sick the heav'ns;
Ghosts glut the throat of hell!

O what have kings to answer for
Before that awful throne;
When thousand deaths for vengeance cry,
And ghosts accusing groan!

Like blazing comets in the sky
That shake the stars of light,
Which drop like fruit unto the earth
Thro' the fierce burning night;

Like these did Gwin and Gordred meet,
And the first blow decides;
Down from the brow unto the breast
Gordred his head divides!

Gwin fell: the sons of Norway fled,
All that remain'd alive;
The rest did fill the vale of death,
For them the eagles strive.

The river Dorman roll'd their blood
Into the northern sea;
Who mourn'd his sons, and overwhelm'd
The pleasant south country.",misc

Melt away their shortcomings by enduring trials

When it comes to being true, at least true to me (Yeah, that's that shit right there)
One thing I found, one thing I found, oh no you never let me down

[Verse 1]
Born October 31st, 2001
Back then I couldn't comprehend I was surrounded with love
Even though I was born second you made me feel like I'm first
And for the life of me, I don't think that you know what that's worth
You named me Joseph, like the one in the Bible, had many dreams
It seems we're similar because no one believes
But there's a reason people choose to shy away from the truth
A few think I can do it and one of them is you
I just don't want to let you down because you always held me up
You wanted my mind to be free like the key to some handcuffs
And it's sad I'll have to leave but it's a part of growing up
I guess that's why you told me I shouldn't be in any rush

[Verse 2]
Worked at Payless trying to make end meet
I couldn't pay less attention, but you put shoes on my feet
For your family raising two boys, wanted stability
God fearing and handling every responsibility
But now I'm older and a normal life don't appeal to me
But life is coming so fast, it almost don't seem real to me
So when I ask you questions trying to gain some advice, it's because I wanted to be you, even a little bit alike, like
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
I just don't want to let you down
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you never let me down

[Verse 3]
Even if we're like two countries at war, trying to kill each other
Wherever you're at in life, I'll always be your brother
Lies don't exist in our world, we're real to one another
And if they come at you they better be ready to take cover
It's like I have a shell because you always have my back
And if they're slugging shells your way, you know I'd have to take that
I would die for you, my bro, you're one of my own, family, second in command, next one on the throne
Not above you, we're equals, you're always standing by my side
We hustle together, 24/7 on the grind
Even when I was bad you always pushed me along
So this right here?
Family this is your song

[Verse 4]
I don't care what anyone else thinks, who are you to me?
If you're not helping me get proceeds I'll proceed to the currency
And currently paper is constantly in my thoughts
Life is like ball, no apologies to who I crossed
Even through all mistakes and every single loss
Gotta provide for everyone, succeed at all costs
Because no matter how cocky or arrogant I may sound
The first thing on my mind, I just don't want to let you down, down
[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
I just don't want to let you down

My OG had to tell me not to worry 'bout another niggas words
Used to think this shit was fun 'til I saw brodie in that hearse
You was meeting up a bitch, the next second you was murked
Man that shit had got me sick, couldn't get your moms inside that church
And everytime I'm on the phones, I hear the pain that's in your voice
You can choose to do the crime, but in that hole you got no choice
I got niggas doing time for the niggas that who did it
But real niggas keep it silent and they plottin' while they sittin'
And damn, me and my grandfather wasn't close
But I still wish I said goodbye before they let that casket close
And I ain't good with no goodbyes, I swear to God I hate farewells
But one day we'll be together when I'm walking that stairwell
Aye, and granny startin' to lose her memory
But let me tell you that I love you before you forget 'bout me
Aye, and granny startin' to lose her memory
One day I'll have to say goodbye, I hope you remember me

Sitting in the back of the car! Seeing you and her in the front seat
Every time I ask how far, what I really mean is why couldn't it be me?
I don't want to be left behind, I don't want to be left behind
I'm sick of always being the third wheel
I don't want to be left behind

[Verse 1]
Condensation on the window, a frost bitten heart
Driving down the road I'm in the back of the car
Looking at shit passing by, if only I were half the guy
That you always wanted. Would still have done it?
My soul lost control but I wasn't even driving
I wish we hit that pole, and I was the only one that died in a horrible accident
My own suicide, and then I snap back I'm along for the ride
I envisioned my own death
Figured that I hit it now
Dying all alone is how I figured I'd go out
It's not that I want to do it, it's useless to try to move it
It's just that I've got a clue
And it made me see how stupid all these thoughts really are
But I can't seem to shake 'em
When I see a happy couple, all I want to do is make the memories go away
I can take another day, I haven't been through enough pain
Why can't they just get slain?

[Verse 2]
Last girl to give me a chance completely fucked me over
And ever since then, I've been sitting on the sofa
Confused and grown colder
Hoping it blows over while I'm getting the cold shoulder
So I'm done, it's game over
No more I'm sick of it, no less than a hypocrite
Cuz it just repeats itself, never any different shit
Never any piff to spliff, never any hits to get
No more Mr. Nice Guy I'm fucking sick of it
I don't want to be left behind any more
I want to drive the car, push the pedal to the floor
So I'm ready for the tours, have my mental be explored
I'm ready for this world, all I need's a special girl
No one understands all the loneliness I feel
The pain from the wound is equally as real
It won't go away, if I swallow a few pills
I just need to sit back, hear the spinning of the wheels

Friends in the backseat nobody frown
Bottle’s constantly ""turned"" upside down
Songs and chatter main background sound
Pull up to the favorite restaurant you found
Pass the drinks pizza's lightly browned
Sun's setting start to look around
Grab her by the hand and explore the town
Walk by a cute church spin her around
Share a little moment in the market ground
Crack a few jokes be her favorite clown
Snap a few pics when you both lie down
Got you feeling lucky Mr. Stud Mr. triple crown
Treat her like a princess when the pants come (haha, come on guys)

Rolling out as the night rolls in
Find a beachy place now that’s good gin
Music’s bumpin' now you got a grin
Girls drag you to the floor -twins
Apparently saw you the moment you walked in
Everybody’s vibing tingle on your skin
Isn't gonna be a might-have-been
Let nature take over, moves built-in
Invite em to the bar, shots like bowling pins
Feeling something start to stir within
All you need's to release the firing pin
Friends hype you up no more safety pin
Next words you spoke like a violin
""How'd you two like to see my Inn""
""Promise to absolve us of any cardinal sin""
The other one whispered ""let the games begin""

Henry from Belize
In search of the best dinner sailed the seven seas
In town met a chef drinking Tea Anise, told him to come to her restaurant Annie's
Best meal ever put Henry at ease
Cuz finally his quest he could cease
So I asked him what he ate and he said please
Best meal I ever had was her on her (haha)

Man ya goddamn right
Last time I hit the Eastside they stole my bike
Nigga had to sell a pack just to get back right
Mask on with the heater, told em if I ever see it
Boy, the first track on Yeezus
It's gone be 'On Sight'
Bus number 5 used to slide through at night
Bring weed and a frosty, lay that pipe
Palm trees on your IG, hey that's nice
But you ain't even have a bed or a bedroom light
But we gone be alright
Told you I was next up, you said 'right'
You was too busy trying to get flewed out
By them D-list ass niggas that I opened up for
At the Blues House
Now a nigga 'Up' like balloon house
Fly till I die like I'm Left Eye
I'm never going back to the Eastside
Fuck I look like
I'm a paid ass nigga from the Westside
[Chorus]
But a nigga getting money on the Southside
I see you're still on the Eastside
Shawty live on the Eastside
She gone die on the Eastside
Damn

Goddamn right
Had to move a pack just to get back right
Told you I would never come back to Eastside
Never ever ever come back to Eastside
Nah nah That's Right

Now that you heard from me
What you want from me
Sliding to the East
Cause you're all I need
Don't you back out on me
Don't be mad at me
Back in the East

Now that you heard from me
What you want from me
Sliding to the East

And I'm thinkin' of you
Thinkin' of you

That there was something wrong
And if it’s caught I could set it right
Or at least, I could try

All through the night and down in your eyes
I mined and mined and mined
Given time, what I looked for, I would find
I was right, I was right, I was right

And every word I overturned like a stone rolling easy
And all I’d see hidden underneath only served to make me lonely
Your trouble is like a lens through which the whole world bends
And then you can’t set it straight again

Winter passed and summer storms came
And flashed white in the evening
You came in wet, you were laughing and grinning
Shook my shoulders, tried to get me smiling

Washing everything down the street again
My slow heart wanted only what was endless

Feel like I’m trapped up in the dark
No one knows my pain
And no ones around

Trapped in the dark
And it feel like I’m breaking apart
And all my lashes, betrayal, and contusions
Have taken a toll on my heart
My drip is invisible scars
Wounds still covered in gauze
And My ambitions turned them opposition
Even when they was closer than blood
I’m in the dark
Damn
But fuck it I swallow my pain
Even though that shit feels like a blade
That runs through my body and ruptures my veins
Tears are covered by shades
Still I try to contain
I clinch my jaw till my molars crack
Still can seem to hold them back

Feel like I’m trapped up in the dark

And no ones around
Dark
Feel like I’m trapped up in the dark
No one knows my pain
And no ones around

Feel like I’m trapped up in it

The burden of the strongest man is that he’s independent
He gotta stiffen that chin and
He gotta keep that grin in
His pride needs defending
His pride needs defending
I thought that I was winning
Till the lights went dim and
I’m looking around
Ain’t nobody really to hold me down
And I’m fighting my demons in silence
It’s the way men are raised but then I guess
If I seen another man
Dealing with the  things I am
Would I offer a helping hand
No
And I feel like I’m worthless
Like ain’t shit in this world I’m deserving
Like leaving this earth and
Knowing nobody would stop for the moment
Is misery the company I’ve chosen
Or the outcome of what I’m bestowed with
I feel like I’m losing my ground
Feeling invisible inside of this crowd
Feeling like I’m lonely next to you right now
Feeling like these moments never could end
Just the beginning of a terrible trend
Fall back down get up again
Got bit by the same dogs I fed
Same bitch I had on my bed
Same ones that couldn’t split meals
So I paid bills now I count the dead

Aim for the flickering flame
Day after day now with the rigorous training
Face the pain but with a discipline brain
Stay on point and you will see your little dreams

Became a big blaze and you slayed the beast
That tried to stray you away from the gracious
Place that fed you peaceful plates
I'm talking Chang, Jackson, Gomez and Rosenthal
While many are called but few are chosen y'all
Now with everybody then we gotta get with those involved
Take charge, turn the feeble resource
To a heaping reward, divvy up in three parts
Peace and love and happiness
If faced with love, please acquiesce
Reach out, re-route the apprehension
Let it free, let it seep when it sets in
Try again if it meets with rejection
Love is the room and the heart is the entrance

Face the pain but with a disciplined brain

How you feel?  I'm straight, but I could be better
I'm composin a letter, a letter for what?
A letter to state, showin the fate, of mankind
Line for line
I'm livin decent but I'm cryin; I'm sick of tryin to
Come up on a grip, don't slip, that's easy
I step in military formation
Pacin the cold streets, dark nights, and gang fights
Over, territory, that ain't right, I might
Just step back and react on a different plane
Change the slang, watch the devils go insane
Cause they don't understand a damn thang
Life ain't the same when you use your brain
Reveal the name, don't be estranged
They not ready to see the true blackness
In fact this is a whole new concept but I'll keep you in step
Oooh!  Watch the moves it's a dusty groove
And I, come with bullshit to make hits
I, hold the essence of effervescence, now

The truth borne from people leaving, going away

Shut your eyes closed
Shut your eyes and read between the lines

Everyone who stood by you
Are the same ones who just left
Your cavalry's gone, gone
Don't hold your breath dear
Bets laid so low I thought you'd never clue in
Be careful who you keep these days, as friends these days

Love is a lie and your friends ain’t real
Life is a joke and nobody cares
But when we are together
Your a little less scared

You don’t know who to trust
Cause the men in your life
Just use you for lust
Raped in your heart
Raped in your mind
Suppressing all the feelings
That’s building up over time
So you pray to the henny
And got plenty of tattoos
I remember you were standing in the bathroom
Bout to make a declaration of your life
Putting writing on the wall
With the blood from a knife
Back homе your house wasn’t a home
Your mama say she lovеs you
But that isn’t what is shown
You ain’t have a father figure
When you was a little girl
Over taken by the evil and the demons of the world
Damn
And I can see it in your eyes
Told to be strong but with me you can cry
So take off the mask
And chains from the past
Turning pain into power so we can last
I understand the frustration
And Haste decisions your making
So indecisive cause baby I do it too
Living in a world where the trouble
Is evident on your face
But nobody will ever notice a clue

It burns my eyes and pit of my lung
There's a beauty in this moment

I fear the end is drawing near
The sky is grey and these people share my fear
But there's water in my eyes
In the dead of night again
Add it seems that every time I tell a lie
I am my doctor's best friend
But he spits on the truth
Turns my aches and pains into something he believes in
Some standard refrain
I'm the storm in the sky
And I will rain until I die
But I am not just gunna sit here
And take it on the chin
Cause sometimes I'm angry and sometimes I'm sad
But this time, you've got the wrong kid
I think I'll stay inside
The world is better off without me
In its eyes
A rusty bucket for a face
And breath that could kill a man
And now you think you've found a cure
A pretty girl in the shape of a door
And you listen to her cry
Be a blanket in the dead of night
But you see that is your crux
You are always just some friendly guy
But I'm done
Yeah I'm done
All want is to be loved
And to make it to that door just to see what's going on
I will slowly open and pray
The handle comes unstuck cause
I cannot seem to focus without knowing what's beyond
The last one led to the edge of a grave
So this time I must pick the right one

He invited me you know, to go with them
And I thought
This would be crossing a line

But if we keep trying in this moment
I know it will surely be the end

And you're tired of making me cry

It's kinda scary, the futures so unclear

Landon Tewers: You care a lot about- You care a lot about lyrics and that's like to me, that's everything too. Like you actually write lyrics a lot faster than I do but yeah, it's good to work with someone that's like very much on the same page creatively, you know?
Gabbie Hanna: I'm definitely up and down with lyrics though, I think that you caught me in a very like- this song for example was like, kind of- Actually we kind of spent a lot of time on this one.
Landon Tewers: Yeah we did
Gabbie Hanna: But like “I Sold My Soul” I feel like those were coming pretty slowly but consistently
Landon Tewers: Yeah, yeah those, those took a while

Gabbie Hanna: But like the song um “Hang Ups” that one, that one I feel like I wrote really quickly, but like I also wasn't very emotionally attached...

12:10 Conversation regarding the song ""Monster"" & ""Monster (Reborn)""

Gabbie Hanna: My biggest fear, for real, is like, being like my mom, and like not living in a reality, that's like- like she'll do shit where I'm like, “You really think you're right like you really don't see what you're doing,” and that's in me. Like that's in my DNA, that's what I wrote Monster about is like- if you listen to- There's this outro called um- Did you listen to (Monster) Reborn? it's just-
Landon Tewers: I've heard all of your songs, yeah
Gabbie Hanna: So there's just like this little “Am I my mother's daughter?” and I'm just like “Fuck, like I'm having so much trouble” [Gabbie Chuckling] So like is it that- I just like am so incapable of seeing that because I'm such a fucking narcissist? But I've had enough therapists at this point telling me like, “I'm gonna tell you right now why you're not a narcissist because you're asking me if you are”

And then I was slavin' at the 9 to 5 patiently waitin' for my time to shine
After three months we planned to have a child
Thought it would slow you down, stop you from acting wild
Cordell was born, I cried when he cracked a smile
That was then we on a whole 'nother chapter now
You moved out so you can freely fuck yo ex again

You grew up it seemed like we could be friends
But to be friends you had to see ends

Andrew lived up north, he's in my present thoughts
His momma hates a nigga, that's why we rarely talk
I have this fly job gave you my child support
Wherever you need it you had my support
You say you fell in love and had to mash then you took my son away from me and moved to Atlanta
That hurt me real bad more than I could ever tell
Became a different person after yo marriage failed

I'm just a stranger in the street
A stranger you will meet
But i'm only halfway there
Your friends introduced me to you
Saying ""how do you do""
Then you shook my hand
I said I like to pretend
With thoughts of no end
Would you be my friend?
I’m not gonna apprehend
Cause we are together
We’re lost forever

[Chorus]
You’ve lost it now
You turned somehow
Girl you used to be fine
But you’ve crossed the line
You’re a bit of a snob but that’s ok by me
But you gotta respect me, can’t you see?
[Verse 2]
I like to feed you well
And talk about how I felt
When the bullies rubbed me the wrong way
I was taking it slow
So slow that I will grow
Right out of my shell
But I can’t do it right
I can’t hold tight
Settle down tonight
Tomorrow a big fight
I like to make some jokes
To all of the bitches and blokes

[Chorus]
You’ve lost it now
You turned somehow
Girl you used to be fine
But you’ve crossed the line
You’re a bit of a snob but that’s ok by me
But you gotta respect me, can’t you see?

[Verse 3]
Then right out of the blue
You got into another dude
Who is built and muscular
This came to a surprise
That you think I ain’t wise
But who are you to judge
My feelings upside down
As it’s always a frown
When I see your gang in town
Envy has now gone brown
I thought that we were close
But it’s heartbreak at most
[Chorus]
You’ve lost it now
You turned somehow
Girl you used to be fine
But you’ve crossed the line
You’re a bit of a snob but that’s ok by me
But you gotta respect me, can’t you see?

[Verse 4]
Falling in love in school
Making me look like a fool
For asking you to go out with me
You were shocked when its revealed
That the true love weren't real
But can't we still be good friends?
You're making a massive flaw
When you know your head is sore
When I opened up the door
You two were down on the floor
I'm not here to catch your jumper
Aww fuck it, I don't wanna date an Oompa Loompa

[Chorus]
You’ve lost it now
You turned somehow
Girl you used to be fine
But you’ve crossed the line
You’re a bit of a snob but that’s ok by me
But you gotta respect me, can’t you see?
[Verse 5]
You always silence me
On the gram or on the street
Because I can’t respect your choice
But girl it has been a while
Since the last time you smile
At me, didn’t you used to do that?
You see, I’ve grown more wise
And even bigger in size
But can’t you realise
That them jokes were lies
I said I was gonna change
But so subtle within a range

[Chorus]
You’ve lost it now
You turned somehow
Girl you used to be fine
But you’ve crossed the line
You’re a bit of a snob but that’s ok by me
But you gotta respect me, can’t you see?

I cared about you, but you can’t seem to get it through that thick head of yours

Now everything is changing, but I still feel the same
We're running out of time

What do I have to do?
To try and make you see, that this is who I am, and it's all that I can be

I try to find myself, looking inside your eyes, you're all that I wanted to be
There must be something else, behind all the lies, that you wanted me to believe
Now everyone is saying, that I should find a way, to leave it all behind

I chop the body up and ate it wit some faba beans
Lava soap clean the body up I dance to the screams
I'm a mad man - then I cane ya like the sandman
A bad man - tryin to kill all that I can man
I grab a hatchet then I run around the block
And peep inside your windows while I'm hidin from the cops
Lyrical massacres a masterpiece
I crack the skull and place the brains up on the mantle piece
I lost my my mind so bring it back to me
I fuck the law with my dick in my hand

Leavin corpses fuckin lookin like an afghan

Can't handle this reality? Cuz your livin in my nightmare

Last nigga touched his feelings and he never hear back
Just wanna live right now
Out in London her bridge went down
Til she gettin' ready for a trip right now
The world lookin' at her like how bitch, how
I mean she work at the club and its poppin' all the time
But she gotta spend money with the bitches on the side
And she live with her mama and she doesn't even drive
And all those bitches trippin' cuz she travel all the time
Stay postin' Instagram pics in Dubai
And her feelings never show like who took it
But turn around girl show me how its lookin'

7032,"Purple goo came out the drain this morning
As I was brushing my teeth for school
It swallowed my toothbrush whole
I wonder if I should call a plumber

I got shampoo in my eyes when I showed
It's no surprise, I'm not very responsible
It added five minutes to my morning routine
Maybe next time I should be more careful

Rip the curtains off
Close the bathroom door
Bite the bar soap
Give yourself the time to

Purple goo went viral on twitter this morning
It got 7000 likes before my lunch
Buzzfeed contacted me about it
I plugged my venmo in the replies

My roommate squeezes toothpaste from the middle
Don't they know that's not the best way to do it
They make a mess every day

Ready to go
Undeserving of life

Nobody ever cared about me
Nobody ever did anything to help

671,"CHAPTER 5: ARABIAN TUNNEL

The same day, I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of the foregoing conversation directly concerning them. When I told them we would be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days, Conseil clapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.

""An underwater tunnel!"" he exclaimed. ""A connection between two seas! Who ever heard of such malarkey!""

""Ned my friend,"" Conseil replied, ""had you ever heard of the Nautilus? No, yet here it is! So don't shrug your shoulders so blithely, and don't discount something with the feeble excuse that you've never heard of it.""

""We'll soon see!"" Ned Land shot back, shaking his head. ""After all, I'd like nothing better than to believe in your captain's little passageway, and may Heaven grant it really does take us to the Mediterranean.""

The same evening, at latitude 21° 30' north, the Nautilus was afloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab coast. I spotted Jidda, an important financial center for Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and the East Indies. I could distinguish with reasonable clarity the overall effect of its buildings, the ships made fast along its wharves, and those bigger vessels whose draft of water required them to drop anchor at the port's offshore mooring. The sun, fairly low on the horizon, struck full force on the houses in this town, accenting their whiteness. Outside the city limits, some wood or reed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived.

Soon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening, and the Nautilus went back beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters.

The next day, February 10, several ships appeared, running on our opposite tack. The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating; but at the moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship rose again to its waterline.

With Ned and Conseil, I went to sit on the platform. The coast to the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog.

Leaning against the sides of the skiff, we were chatting of one thing and another, when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point in the water, saying to me:

""See anything out there, professor?""
""No, Ned,"" I replied, ""but you know I don't have your eyes.""

""Take a good look,"" Ned went on. ""There, ahead to starboard, almost level with the beacon! Don't you see a mass that seems to be moving around?""

""Right,"" I said after observing carefully, ""I can make out something like a long, blackish object on the surface of the water.""

""A second Nautilus?"" Conseil said.

""No,"" the Canadian replied, ""unless I'm badly mistaken, that's some marine animal.""

""Are there whales in the Red Sea?"" Conseil asked.

""Yes, my boy,"" I replied, ""they're sometimes found here.""

""That's no whale,"" continued Ned Land, whose eyes never strayed from the object they had sighted. ""We're old chums, whales and I, and I couldn't mistake their little ways.""

""Let's wait and see,"" Conseil said. ""The Nautilus is heading that direction, and we'll soon know what we're in for.""

In fact, that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us. It looked like a huge reef stranded in midocean. What was it? I still couldn't make up my mind.

""Oh, it's moving off! It's diving!"" Ned Land exclaimed. ""Damnation! What can that animal be? It doesn't have a forked tail like baleen whales or sperm whales, and its fins look like sawed–off limbs.""

""But in that case—"" I put in.

""Good lord,"" the Canadian went on, ""it's rolled over on its back, and it's raising its breasts in the air!""
""It's a siren!"" Conseil exclaimed. ""With all due respect to master, it's an actual mermaid!""

That word ""siren"" put me back on track, and I realized that the animal belonged to the order Sirenia: marine creatures that legends have turned into mermaids, half woman, half fish.

""No,"" I told Conseil, ""that's no mermaid, it's an unusual creature of which only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea. That's a dugong.""

""Order Sirenia, group Pisciforma, subclass Monodelphia, class Mammalia, branch Vertebrata,"" Conseil replied.

And when Conseil has spoken, there's nothing else to be said.

Meanwhile Ned Land kept staring. His eyes were gleaming with desire at the sight of that animal. His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon. You would have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump overboard and attack the creature in its own element.

""Oh, sir,"" he told me in a voice trembling with excitement, ""I've never killed anything like that!""

His whole being was concentrated in this last word.

Just then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform. He spotted the dugong. He understood the Canadian's frame of mind and addressed him directly:

""If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, wouldn't your hands be itching to put it to work?""

""Positively, sir.""

""And just for one day, would it displease you to return to your fisherman's trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you've already hunted down?""

""It wouldn't displease me one bit.""
""All right, you can try your luck!""

""Thank you, sir,"" Ned Land replied, his eyes ablaze.

""Only,"" the captain went on, ""I urge you to aim carefully at this animal, in your own personal interest.""

""Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"" I asked, despite the Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.

""Yes, sometimes,"" the captain replied. ""These animals have been known to turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats. But with Mr. Land that danger isn't to be feared. His eye is sharp, his arm is sure. If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong, it's because the animal is justly regarded as fine game, and I know Mr. Land doesn't despise a choice morsel.""

""Aha!"" the Canadian put in. ""This beast offers the added luxury of being good to eat?""

""Yes, Mr. Land. Its flesh is actual red meat, highly prized, and set aside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats. Accordingly, this excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that, like its manatee relatives, it has become more and more scarce.""

""In that case, Captain,"" Conseil said in all seriousness, ""on the offchance that this creature might be the last of its line, wouldn't it be advisable to spare its life, in the interests of science?""

""Maybe,"" the Canadian answered, ""it would be better to hunt it down, in the interests of mealtime.""

""Then proceed, Mr. Land,"" Captain Nemo replied.

Just then, as mute and emotionless as ever, seven crewmen climbed onto the platform. One carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in whale fishing. Its deck paneling opened, the skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea. Six rowers sat on the thwarts, and the coxswain took the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I found seats in the stern.

""Aren't you coming, Captain?"" I asked.

""No, sir, but I wish you happy hunting.""

The skiff pulled clear, and carried off by its six oars, it headed swiftly toward the dugong, which by then was floating two miles from the Nautilus.

Arriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean, our longboat slowed down, and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters. Harpoon in hand, Ned Land went to take his stand in the skiff's bow. Harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him. But this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms, and its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that, while floating, would indicate the dugong's movements beneath the waters.

I stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian's adversary. This dugong—which also boasts the name halicore—closely resembled a manatee. Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and its lateral fins in actual fingers. It differs from the manatee in that its upper jaw is armed with two long, pointed teeth that form diverging tusks on either side.

This dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal dimensions, easily exceeding seven meters in length. It didn't stir and seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves, a circumstance that should have made it easier to capture.

The skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the animal. The oars hung suspended above their rowlocks. I was crouching. His body leaning slightly back, Ned Land brandished his harpoon with expert hands.

Suddenly a hissing sound was audible, and the dugong disappeared. Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it apparently had hit only water.

""Damnation!"" exclaimed the furious Canadian. ""I missed it!""

""No,"" I said, ""the animal's wounded, there's its blood; but your weapon didn't stick in its body.""

""My harpoon! Get my harpoon!"" Ned Land exclaimed.

The sailors went back to their sculling, and the coxswain steered the longboat toward the floating barrel. We fished up the harpoon, and the skiff started off in pursuit of the animal.

The latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface of the sea. Its wound hadn't weakened it because it went with tremendous speed. Driven by energetic arms, the longboat flew on its trail. Several times we got within a few fathoms of it, and the Canadian hovered in readiness to strike; but then the dugong would steal away with a sudden dive, and it proved impossible to overtake the beast.

I'll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient Ned Land. He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords in the English language. For my part, I was simply distressed to see this dugong outwit our every scheme.

We chased it unflaggingly for a full hour, and I'd begun to think it would prove too difficult to capture, when the animal got the untimely idea of taking revenge on us, a notion it would soon have cause to regret. It wheeled on the skiff, to assault us in its turn.

This maneuver did not escape the Canadian.

""Watch out!"" he said.

The coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language, and no doubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard.

Arriving within twenty feet of the skiff, the dugong stopped, sharply sniffing the air with its huge nostrils, pierced not at the tip of its muzzle but on its topside. Then it gathered itself and sprang at us.

The skiff couldn't avoid the collision. Half overturned, it shipped a ton or two of water that we had to bail out. But thanks to our skillful coxswain, we were fouled on the bias rather than broadside, so we didn't capsize. Clinging to the stempost, Ned Land thrust his harpoon again and again into the gigantic animal, which imbedded its teeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat out of the water as a lion would lift a deer. We were thrown on top of each other, and I have no idea how the venture would have ended had not the Canadian, still thirsting for the beast's blood, finally pierced it to the heart.

I heard its teeth grind on sheet iron, and the dugong disappeared, taking our harpoon along with it. But the barrel soon popped up on the surface, and a few moments later the animal's body appeared and rolled over on its back. Our skiff rejoined it, took it in tow, and headed to the Nautilus.

It took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the platform. The beast weighed 5,000 kilograms. It was carved up in sight of the Canadian, who remained to watch every detail of the operation. At dinner the same day, my steward served me some slices of this flesh, skillfully dressed by the ship's cook. I found it excellent, even better than veal if not beef.

The next morning, February 11, the Nautilus's pantry was enriched by more dainty game. A covey of terns alighted on the Nautilus. They were a species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt: beak black, head gray and stippled, eyes surrounded by white dots, back, wings, and tail grayish, belly and throat white, feet red. Also caught were a couple dozen Nile duck, superior–tasting wildfowl whose neck and crown of the head are white speckled with black.

By then the Nautilus had reduced speed. It moved ahead at a saunter, so to speak. I observed that the Red Sea's water was becoming less salty the closer we got to Suez.

Near five o'clock in the afternoon, we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed to the north. This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea, which lies between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.

The Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf of Suez. I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed between the two gulfs. It was Mt. Horeb, that biblical Mt. Sinai on whose summit Moses met God face to face, that summit the mind's eye always pictures as wreathed in lightning.

At six o'clock, sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged, the Nautilus passed well out from El Tur, which sat at the far end of a bay whose waters seemed to be dyed red, as Captain Nemo had already mentioned. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds, by the sound of surf chafing against rocks, or by the distant moan of a steamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades.

From eight to nine o'clock, the Nautilus stayed a few meters beneath the waters. According to my calculations, we had to be quite close to Suez. Through the panels in the lounge, I spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays. It seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower.

At 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface, I climbed onto the platform. I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo's tunnel, couldn't sit still, and wanted to breathe the fresh night air.

Soon, in the shadows, I spotted a pale signal light glimmering a mile away, half discolored by mist.

""A floating lighthouse,"" said someone next to me.

I turned and discovered the captain.

""That's the floating signal light of Suez,"" he went on. ""It won't be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel.""

""It can't be very easy to enter it.""

""No, sir. Accordingly, I'm in the habit of staying in the pilothouse and directing maneuvers myself. And now if you'll kindly go below, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves, and it will only return to the surface after we've cleared the Arabian Tunnel.""

I followed Captain Nemo. The hatch closed, the ballast tanks filled with water, and the submersible sank some ten meters down.

Just as I was about to repair to my stateroom, the captain stopped me.

""Professor,"" he said to me, ""would you like to go with me to the wheelhouse?""

""I was afraid to ask,"" I replied.

""Come along, then. This way, you'll learn the full story about this combination underwater and underground navigating.""

Captain Nemo led me to the central companionway. In midstair he opened a door, went along the upper gangways, and arrived at the wheelhouse, which, as you know, stands at one end of the platform.

It was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi or Hudson rivers. In the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables running to the Nautilus's stern. Set in the cabin's walls were four deadlights, windows of biconvex glass that enabled the man at the helm to see in every direction.

The cabin was dark; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness and I saw the pilot, a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of the wheel. Outside, the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform.

""Now,"" Captain Nemo said, ""let's look for our passageway.""

Electric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room, and from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed to his Nautilus. He pressed a metal button and at once the propeller slowed down significantly.

I stared in silence at the high, sheer wall we were skirting just then, the firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast. For an hour we went along it in this fashion, staying only a few meters away. Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles of the compass hanging in the cabin. At a mere gesture from him, the helmsman would instantly change the Nautilus's heading.

Standing by the port deadlight, I spotted magnificent coral substructures, zoophytes, algae, and crustaceans with enormous quivering claws that stretched forth from crevices in the rock.

At 10:15 Captain Nemo himself took the helm. Dark and deep, a wide gallery opened ahead of us. The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed up. Strange rumblings were audible along our sides. It was the water of the Red Sea, hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel's slope. Our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves with propeller in reverse, but the Nautilus went with the torrent, as swift as an arrow.

Along the narrow walls of this passageway, I saw only brilliant streaks, hard lines, fiery furrows, all scrawled by our speeding electric light. With my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart.

At 10:35 Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me:

""The Mediterranean,"" he told me.

In less than twenty minutes, swept along by the torrent, the Nautilus had just cleared the Isthmus of Suez.",misc

6368,"PRESIDENT OBAMA: I want to welcome back Prime Minister Maliki to the White House.  It’s been two years since the last U.S. troops left from Iraq, but the strategic partnership between our two countries remains very strong.

We honor the lives that were lost, both American and Iraqi, to bring about a functioning democracy in a country that previously had been ruled by a vicious dictator.  And we appreciate Prime Minister Maliki’s commitment to honoring that sacrifice by ensuring a strong, prosperous, inclusive and democratic Iraq.

We had a wide-ranging discussion about economic issues, regional issues, and security issues.  And much of our discussion centered on the fact that, although Iraq has made significant progress in areas like oil production and a range of other reforms that have taken place, unfortunately, al Qaeda has still been active and has grown more active recently.  So we had a lot of discussion about how we can work together to push back against that terrorist organization that operates not only in Iraq but also poses a threat to the entire region and to the United States.

I emphasized the ambition of continuing counterterrorism support and partnership, that we were encouraged by the work that Prime Minister Maliki has done in the past to ensure that all people inside of Iraq -- Sunni, Shia and Kurd -- feel that they have a voice in their government.  And one of the most important expressions of that will be elections next year.  I encouraged that Iraq pass an election law and that that moves forward so that people understand that when they have differences they can express them politically, as opposed to through violence.

I also appreciated the efforts that Prime Minister Maliki has made recently to restore stronger relationships with its neighbors, including Kuwait and Turkey and some of the other Gulf states, and expressed my interest in providing whatever support is necessary to make sure that Iraq is working cooperatively and effectively with its neighbors.

We spent considerable amount of time talking about Syria, where the spillover effects of the chaos and Assad's horrific treatment of his own people has had spillover effects in Iraq as well.  And we agreed that it's in the interest of both countries to try to bring about a political settlement, a political transition, inside of Syria that allows the Syrian people to make decisions about their own lives, while, at the same time, isolating extremist factions that could end up not only threatening people inside of Syria, but throughout the region as well.

And I shared with the Prime Minister our efforts to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue in a peaceful way, but emphasized to him how important it is that Iran seize this opportunity to take the right path in accordance with previous international norms and resolutions.  My hope is, is that we can arrive at a resolution, but I emphasized to the Prime Minister how serious we are about preventing a nuclear arms race in a region that would only add to the dangers that so many people there already face.

Throughout this discussion, the main theme was the United States wants to be a strong and effective partner with Iraq and we are deeply invested in seeing an Iraq that is inclusive, that is democratic, and that is prosperous.  And I communicated to the Prime Minister that anything that we can do to help bring about that more hopeful future for Iraq is something that we want to work on.

So, welcome, Mr. Prime Minister.  Thank you so much for coming.

---

PRIME MINISTER MALIKI:  Thank you very much, Mr. President, in the name of God, the merciful.  Mr. President, you went into the details of all the issues that we discussed and the dialogue was very good.  So we mentioned many, many issues that are of common importance for us, and we agreed on them.  It was a very positive, very deep and very strategic dialogue.
We had an agreement that we signed between Iraq and the United States, as you know, and we have a friendship agreement and we have a Strategic Framework Agreement.  And we need to activate them.  And this was one of the main purposes of our visit.  We need to enhance our bilateral relation and to enhance the agreements.

We discussed many issues that are very important for Iraq, for the region, and for the whole world.  And this clearly tends to show that the Strategic Framework Agreement is of essence for the cooperation between the United States and Iraq and for the issues of the world.

And in our discussions today, we wanted to take the Strategic Framework Agreement and our bilateral relation sort of out from the unilateral security and military assistance that the United States provided to us.  We wanted to move to a multi-layer relation at the political, economic level.  And we hope the United States and the United States company and economy to participate in the rebuilding and developing area.

We have a common vision about all the issues that we discussed when it comes to diagnosing the region of terrorism to the Middle East.  And we talked about the way of countering terrorism, and we had similar positions and similar ideas.  We discussed the details of our cooperation with the people who are in charge and will discuss further details about this.  What we want is for Iraq and the region to be able to work together.  And we are working in Iraq at the security level, intelligence level, social level -- at all the levels in organizing our people in order to fight al Qaeda, because it's a scourge for Iraq and the Middle East.

And I told the President that we improved our relation and are still working on improving our relation with all the countries in the region.  And we are aiming at creating a moderation front in order to fight the sectarian front and the violence and the terrorism.  This is very important.  And we, as Iraqis, we act responsibly at all the necessary levels -- political, security, and military -- to do so.

We do know that the democratic experience in Iraq is nascent and fragile, but it was born very strong.  And we need to continue enhancing it and consolidating it, because democracy is very important.  We also want to have the mechanisms of democracy such as elections and we want to hold the elections on time -- and the government is committed to do so -- alongside with other issues like enhancing the national identity.  Democracy needs to be strong, and we are going to strengthen it because it only will allow us to fight terrorism.

And as the President said, we are in total agreement when it comes to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis in Syria, a solution through dialogue.  We are very supportive of Geneva II. We want the Syrian people to have the right to self-determination and to choose its leader.  And also, we want a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear problem.  We do hope to avert nuclear wars in the region, and we also want to avoid the use of chemical weapons, because we and the Syrians suffered a lot from these weapons.

And we will continue with our good relations, bilaterally, and with the Strategic Framework Agreement.  We want them to be strong, and we will continue working on that.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.",misc

No way to surface again
And every move I make
I staking my breath, strangling my neck

Just me shrouded in a nightmare
Cold water covering me
A place where light has never been

Emptiness
Surrounding my body

Screams falling - silence
Tears are drowning
Pressure fills my veins

Opened eyes
To get rid of my chains and
Free myself
From this blackened space
Ignorance
Blown away by the rays of the sun
Enlightening my pale face
Blinded thoughts, now are able to see
Thousands of colours are painting my scenery

Encaged - my self-built prison
In depths nobody knows
And all my cries won't help me
Out of my pain, away from my grave

Just me gliding into nothing
All my life left behind
State of suspense in frozen time

Screams falling - silence
Tears are drowning
Pressure fills my veins

Opened eyes
To get rid of my chains and
Free myself
From this blackened space
Ignorance
Blown away by the rays of the sun
Enlightening my pale face

Blinded thoughts, now are able to see
Thousands of colours are painting my scenery
Gravity of thoughts
They pull you down
Carry you miles away
But often it's just one step
That makes you think of
How to escape
Which path to take
Like the red thread that guides you
Out of your Labyrinth

Free myself (Free myself)

To exist after the elements

But you bury your head back in earth
Coward you fall to your knees
Before your ""holy"" delusions...
Did you think that you would survive
The transition from belief to the Real?
By choosing such a ""life"" over death
You forsake the True Conversion

At the signatures of the Nephelim
Prepare to meet your God
For you know nothing of Him

Two Prozacs a day, her dad's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door, when she turned twenty-four
She's been with thirty men, but three were only friends
She was gonna be an actress, have her own TV show
You can see her shake her ass in a rap music video
Her yellow STD's is now the enemy, looks at her average life
Nothing, has-been, alright

And who's the other guy fucking my ex-girlfriend
When did reality become TV?
What ever happened to sit-coms, gameshows, on the radio?

Where the waves are very peaceful in the sound of distant war

Where the memory of our future is just echoing around
I wanna feel it like a heartbeat

Where the mystery of the through-step is a secret
As the fall that is always in the motion like a still

Not New York but somehow be lonely
The universe that bleeps like the light out on a wing piece of a plane

Hold it down for a three count or just catch it on the chin

2898,"The problem with philosophy is the ease with which it devolves into abstraction. Looking into a philosophy book replete with arcane words such as ""epistemology"" and ""dialethicism,"" and with the author holding forth on esoteric matters that apparently live only in the mind, the uninformed or rather uninitiated reader can be forgiven for assuming that philosophers are the very definition of ""ivory tower"" academics, utterly dissociated from real life and elitists in the worst sense of that much-maligned word. How can one answer the question ""What's the point of philosophy?"" when there are so few examples of how philosophy can be applied to today's everyday life.

One possible answer is to demonstrate the ways in which philosophical concepts can be applied to the task of gaining a broader understanding of something. This is what this essay sets out to accomplish. There can be few things more familiar in popular culture than music videos, and this essay demonstrates how Nietzschean concepts can help illuminate the multifaceted meanings of Kanye West and Jay Z's video ""No Church in the Wild.""(1) In doing so, we will provide an example of how a philosophical framework can assist in unpacking all that is contained in the taut few minutes of this video.

A work of art, however ""high-brow"" or ""low-brow,"" always contains within it the seeds of two reactions: the instinctive/emotional, and the intellectual; in classical and Nietzschean terms, the Dionysian and the Apollonian.(2) It is the difference between the felt reaction and the thought reaction that defines our views of art and allows for a discussion of esthetic effects. It can also be played with by artists: as an example, a song, composed of the two elements of music and lyrics, can produce an ironic effect by placing together seemingly contradictory elements. Sarcastic lyrics set to a syrupy melody, for instance, will cause a form of cognitive dissonance in the listener, who is left to piece together the why behind this choice. This effect is heightened in the world of the music video. Adding the third element of the visual complicates the audience's reactions even further. The dynamic illustration of music and lyrics can be used with as much inventiveness as the director wishes, film a simple shot of a singer performing to a meta-narrative whose link to the song is left to the audience to determine. The viewer-listener is laced with basic questions of esthetics: What is the artist trying to do? How do the images relate to the song? What is being said, or trying to be said? Does the artist succeed in saying it? Does it fit? Does the intent matter? Through this questioning the audience enters into a dialogue with the work, and through it with the artist.

These questions do not, however, necessarily offer a framework for looking more deeply at what a work of art suggests. By taking a philosophical concept as a starting point, it is possible to organize one's thoughts, to choose a vantage point from which to look at the work and see what it is doing, and perhaps determine whether that is what the artist intended it to do. Let us look at an example.

The opening sequence of the video is one of silent menace. A black clad, black-skinned man grips a simple glass bottle, a rag inserted into its neck. There is no need for explanations or exegesis. In this time and in this place, most of us have a visual vocabulary that tells us that the combination of these two simple items, the rag and the bottle, come together as something far more deadly than the sum of their parts. It is a visual signifier that tells us that this is a Molotov cocktail, an infamous incendiary device that first saw use during the Spanish Civil War(3) and that was perfected during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, when the Finns gave it the derisive name of Molotov, an insult aimed at the Soviet foreign minister.(4) As the weapon of the David-like Finns against the Soviet Goliath, with soldiers on foot stopping tanks with the simple expedient of a bottle, this cheap and easily made device became noted as a weapon of choice for a minority struggling against overwhelming force and repression. In the years since the Second World War it has come to be intimately associated with ideas of upheaval. It is the symbol of the riot, the rebellion. In our modern world, it is the anarchist's sigil, evoking in us a host of images and words from the moment it appears, whether in life or, as here, on screen.

While the looming specter of explicit violence confronts us in the image of the un-ignited Molotov cocktail, its threat yet to be actualized, a more implicit threat of violence is also present, in the form of that black-clad, black-skinned male body. In his work on the philosophy of race, particularly in the existentially grounded Black Bodies, White Gazes, philosopher George Yancy discusses the ways in which the black body, particularly the black male body, is read as a threat by white society.(5) As such the Heideggerian Dasein of blackness, its very beingness, posits within the white gaze, without immediate provocation, the possibility of imminent violence, the threat of social decay. This is a coding that never leaves it even in such innocent act as stepping into an elevator. Because the black body is automatically read as driven by passion rather than by thought, of being bestial rather than fully human, the Black man is a threat, because he has not been, and possibly cannot ever fully be tamed. For much of the first minute of the video that this black body is just that, only a body, featureless, decapitated by the frame that cuts off at the man's neck.

Thus the opening image of the music video for ""No Church in the Wild"" confronts us with a doubled image of violence, one the explicit threat of the man holding a weapon, the other the implicit threat of this man's blackness. This opening message warns the viewer that we are ready to move beyond the boundaries of the map, passing into those uncharted areas once marked with the ominous warning that hc svnt dracones, Latin for here be dragons. With their implications of descent from the empyrean realm of civilization into the bloody conflict of an urban jungle, this image provides us with a fitting point from which to begin an examination of the visual and lyrical message of ""No Church in the Wild"" within the context of the work of Friedrich Nictzsche, who more than once found himself wrongly accused of spreading a plague of nihilistic thought.

Nietzsche did not advocate of nihilism but was as a careful, patient examiner of the phenomenon, but to view Nietzsche as a nihilist would be incorrect and to trivialize his thought. In many ways he did not see nihilism as a valid response to the world, but considered it a decadent response to the world(6) and saw it as a problem to be overcome. It simply wasn't a problem that could be overcome by moral preaching however, rather the proper response had to be grounded in the body and it had to be aesthetic.

Concluding that previous systems of belief had reached their end point, Nictzsche could only follow that logic to its relentless end, nihilism, but he sought also a way forward from it. Thus he created the concept ofamor fati, allowing him to affirm a love of life despite what might seem its emptiness:I do not want to wage war against ugliness. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in ,all and on the whole: someday I want only to be a Yes-sayer! (The Gay Science, 276)This is not the most enduring image of Nietzsche. Much more famous, or perhaps more correctly infamous, is the brooding man with the oversized mustache, the Nietzsche who pronounced Theothanatos, ""Gott ist tot,"" the declaration of the death of God.(7) Yet for all that this herald of funerary tidings was one man in the physical sense. In philosophical spirit, it might be said that there were two men named Friedrich Nietzsche, the intellectual nihilist and the relentless life-lover. Reading the early writings of Nietzsche, we find that at the very beginning of his career as a philosopher, Nietzsche was still in the grip of what he would later call a sickness. This sickness, this fever of the mind, was the result of the influence of such men as Wagner, Schopenhauer, and even Kant. It was a sickness of transcendence, in which the world was thought to be still divided into the high and low.

The central focus of Nietzsche's first work, The Birth of Tragedy; is art, particularly the dramatic tragedies of ancient Greece. Nietzsche conceives of art neither as the simple pursuit of a group of dilettante craftsmen, nor as the lofty pursuit of an ""enlightened"" caste of philosopher-artistes. Rather, art is something much greater, something that cannot be confined to these elites classes. It is nothing less than the highest pursuit of man and the metaphysical goal toward which all men should strive. This is contrary, however, to generally accepted Judeo-Christian morality, for which the search for virtue held pride of place and art was a frivolous distraction, if not downright sinful. The young Nietzsche rejected this view. For him, morality was the symbol of a dead god, a debilitating poison that we are tricked into thinking the sweetest of wines, deluding us into believing we are slaking our thirst even as it weakens us. Only through art can we hope to achieve perfection or fulfillment as it is art that allows us to lay title to that contentious claim of authenticity. He did, however, deem art, aesthetic value as it were, as the antidote to nihilism and morality.

The Birth of Tragedy is the epitome of a young man's book; in later years, even Nietzsche himself denounced it, at times savagely. Despite this, it earns a place in our study for its introduction of Nietzsche's concept of art and life being separated into the Dionysian and the Apollonian. It is the conflict of these two states, named after the wild god of wine and the stately god of poetry and light, respectively, that makes life three-dimensional. And it is also, as we saw earlier, the conflict that informs our view of any given work of art.
In Judeo-Christian morality, influenced by Plato's view of the world of the mind, or the spirit, being truer and more relevant than that of the mere five senses, the Dionysian elements of life were repressed. The enjoyment of the physical world was held to be a sin; fallen hunaanity should aspire only to abnegation and spiritual enlightenment, ignoring the desires of the body as wiles of the devil. But Nietzsche rejects the view that the physical is inherently inferior or sinful, or that enjoyment is. Mikhail Bakhtin pointed out that the medieval church had to allow Carnival, the eruption of all that was
repressed in evel-jday life. Nietzsche argues that such saturnalian revelry is not merely steam that has to be occasionally let out from a boiling pot. It is an integral part oflmmanity, the celebration of the joy of living. Christianity, fixated on the idea of what happens after death, has lost sight of this. What's more, Dionysian revelry is not merely a wild, drunken party: It is a creative act, the source of art. Theatrc in Ancient Greece was not, after all, just a pleasant evening out. It was a sacred ritual dedicated to Dionysus.

Despite what Christianity preaches, then, the Dionysian spirit is ÷ not an assault on God or an outbreak of atheistic anarchy but rather it
is a manifestation of the divine spirit. As the foundation of art, it is at
the base of what we have noted is the highest aspiration of humanity.

But Dionysus alone cannot fully create art, because anarchy is formless and shapeless. It is the influence of Apollo that allows art to become something more and enduring. Apollo's realm is that of abstraction, of pure thought, removed and divorced from base physical needs or desires, or for that matter from the threat of the physical. The latter are in the domain Dionysus's, and as such are dangerous. In Aalcient Greece, the female followers of Dionysus who slipped the bounds of the deeply repressive patriarchy to run riot through the hills. Men never knew quite what they did, but there wcre rumors of strange orgies and bloody feasts of goats torn to pieces and eaten raw. It was these Maenads who were responsible for thc death of Apollo's son Orpheus, who still mourning his loss of Eurydice, for a second time refused to sleep with them, and they ripped him limb from limb. The Apollonian is tlms left both afraid and disgusted by the Dionysian impulse, willing to acknowledge it only under the condition of repressing it.

For all that we are fleshy things and theretbre creatures rooted in the Dionysian although we are often educated in the Apollonian mode and taught that the physical is the lesser of the two realms.

Certainly Plato, at least in the fictional guise of Socrates leadhlg us through the pages of his Republic, thought so. As Plato's famous allegory of the cave suggests, the realm of the Dionysian is the realm of appearance, of shadow, of opinion. So long as we remain bound in the sensual chains of Dionysus we shall be unable to know the light of truth.9 Even Augustine of Hippo, whose prayer for chastity was tempered by the request that it come not quite yet, held the Neoplatonic conviction that the goodness to be found in the material world was but a pale reflection of the light of God. Thus it would be sinful and foolish to become enamored of the goodness here while becoming blinded to the transcendent goodness of the divine. That is, no matter how wonderful something in this world might be, the divine offers so much more that there is no purpose in contemplating the material. Aristotle, as is well known, considered contemplation the highest fbrm of pleasure, because it brought man closer to the divine spirit, and helped to perfect the soul.

This then is the conclusion of the dominant Classical philoso-
phy that was subsumed in Christianity, that it is to the realm of the
Apollonian we should turn our eyes, whether we call it Heaven, the
realm of forms, or something else entirely. The ultimate goal is to ÷ transcended the limits of our flesh and become something more.
Morality, the set of guidelines by which we might engage in right-
living, is the primary tool that enables us to do so. Yet Nietzsche felt
that it was art, and specifically art contra morality, that should be the
guiding principle of humanity. As such, the Apollonian realm should
not be the focus of our striving.

Yet the solution is not, according to Nietzsche, to dive more fully into the Dionysian world, which would be as one-sided and misguided as the perpetual focus on the transcendent. It would be more accurate to say that the Apollonian realm should not stand in isolation as the focus of our striving.

Nietzsche believed that the clash between these two realms and their subsequent melding, the forming of a symbiotic whole that was greater than the sum of its parts, not only gave strength to Greek tragedy, but was also a powerful influence on the character of the ancient Greeks as they engaged in the daily performance that we call life. To reject the Dionysian is to deny an essential part of ourselves, yet to cast aside the Apollonian and its ""higher"" impulses is equally a denial of a part of our nature. Casting either one aside leads to a life-negating mode of being. To be life-affirming, one must embrace the totality of life. Only by joining our ""highest"" aspirations to our ""lowest"" impulses can one begin to hold a life-affirmilag stance.
This contrast between life-negating and life-affirming ways of being would continue to be a theme in Nietzsche's work even after he cast aside all thoughts of transcendence. As Deleuze points out in Nietzsche and Philosophy, Nietzsche was not a nihilist, because the root of nihilism is ""nihil,"" which means zero, nothingness, the absence of any positivity. ""Nihil""-ism is antithetical to any life affirming ethos, and therefore Nietzsche's ""will to power,"" which is a way of affirming life, is the opposite of a death-drive. It is the will toward life and its intensification.

The above has all been rather abstract. In fact, for the last few paragraphs, we have been working firmly in the Apollonian realm, which can be that ivory tower we previously noted that turns most people off philosophy. Let us bring in Dionysus, then, by returning to the contemplation of a worldly artifact, the video of ""No Church in the Wild."" This video is especially suited to a discussion of Nietzsche's view because it can not only be discussed in terms of the differences between Apollonian and Dionysian, but also illustrates them.

It is instructive to watch this video with the sound off, to see what is being said in the visual realm alone. We noted earlier how the multi-dimensionality of the music video complicates the audience's response to it. By separating the visual elements from the audio ones, we can perhaps achieve a closer reading. And so we return to that black body holding the Molotov cocktail and, in light of Nietzsche, another layer is added to our discussion. The fear the black body produces is a very specific type of fear, because in the common white imagining of the world, black lmmans are purely Dionysian creatures. Colonialism was founded on the assumption that whites were not merely more ""civilized,"" but inherently more capable of civilization. The theoretical benevolence of the ""white man's burden,"" the paternalistic impulse to improve the black man's moral standing, was tempered by the fact that it was understood that the black man could never actually reach the same level as the white man. Blacks were by nature incapable of truly inhabiting Apollo's realm, though they might be instructed in it enough to keep them from being a danger. This view has not entirely disappeared. The black body is still visualized as rampantly physical, as can be seen in the cliches of the black instinctively having ""rhythm in their souls,"" always dancing like the demonic Africans on the shores of the Congo in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and being a perpetual sexual threat to the white man, assumed to be oversexed, ithyphallic lovers. So, for example, in the case of a riot, despite the multiple ethnicities of the participants, the event itself is personified by a black man seen against the background of white policemen. In many instances the police in America appear to be protecting neoclassical monuments and buildings of power--capital buildings and courthouses--symbols of Apollonian state rationalism, from the Dionysian rioters.

We have already confronted these threats from the first image of the video, the contained menace of the unlit cocktail. Now, the subdued scritch of a disposable lighter and the whomph of an accelerant-soaked rag bursting to life presage the birth of a sonorous beat, as our ears follow our eyes and we are pulled into the dual-exegesis of video and song. The scenario is one that we've increasingly seen delivered in the media, from Egypt to Brazil to Europe and America with rioters, of multiple ethnicities, filling the street, and preparing to rush police as the first Molotov cocktail is let fly. Dionysus is unleashed, his lack of restraint as visible in the uncontrolled spread of the flames as in the black man's two upraised middle fingers. There will be no manners here.

Remaining for a moment only with what we see, not what we hear, what follows is fascinatingly ambiguous: There is no way to know what side we should be on. The general ethos of rap makes us suspect that the rioters are automatically the ""good guys,"" rising up against an oppressive society represented by the riot police with their clubs and shields, but the violence demonstrated by both sides suggests something closer to equality. History provides no guide, while insurrections such as these have been as explicable as, say, the Rodney King riots or as justified as the recent spate of revolutions again dictatorships in the Middle East, others have been as morally bankrupt as the explosion of anger in Vancouver in 2011 over a lost hockey game. In the video both sides brought their weapons to the fight, and after all, the rioters, so far as we can see, fire the first shot. The ethical equality of the two sides is particularly demonstrated toward the middle of the video, with the juxtaposition of the rioter standing on top of a car having his feet knocked from under him by a policeman's nightstick, and a mounted officer being pushed off his horse by a rioter's pole. The stomach clenches with the same horror at what happens to one as to the other. Lovers of ancient art will be nervous to see the statuary taken over by the mob, and everyday shoppers will worry as the rioters attack the mall, throwing rocks at the mannequins--yet more white statues under threat by an out-of-control destructive force.

The violence of the unleashed Dionysus would appear to justify its repression. It is the classic argument against anarchism, that without the strictures and taboos of society, people will be too irrational to look out for anything but what they perceive as their immediate self-interest, and society will devolve into permanent chaos. Yet transgressions occur even with the existence of moral codes and laws that cannot be absolute. At what point does it become acceptable to riot against current authority? Most people will agree that destructive riots because of the outcome of a sports event lack any sort of morality; what of riots following a clearly unjust verdict in a court case? What of riots against an authority that refuses to listen, as in June 2013 in Turkey? What of riots that bring down dictatorships, as in the Arab Spring? At what point does one change sides? How do we respond to authority using brutality to put down a riot when we agree that the riot needed to be put down? What can we do when protests we agree with begin attacking innocent targets? There can be no clear answer, because life is not cut-and-dried or, dare we say it, black and white. There is a constant ambiguity in how we respond to events, because morality itself is ambiguous, often dependent on circumstances and so connected to the rest of the world that it is impossible to truly measure what effect a decision will have. This ambiguity of morality was the theme of Nietzsche's later Beyond Good and Evil (1886), and it is an ambiguity that pervades much of Kanye West's body of work.

What we see in the video, then, is ambiguous, because we have no guidelines to tell us on which side morality lies. Viewers are likely to decide based on their preexisting concepts of society and the law. In terms of the actions we see, there seems to be nothing to decide between. Both sides seem only to offer violence: Our choice is between agreeing to oppression and beating up rioters, while risking being set on fire, or rebelling, destroying everything we come across, and facing the tear gas, the dogs, and the billyclub. There seems to be no middle ground. The only thing both sides can agree on is causing the other as much pain as possible.

The ambiguity of the visual element is clear. Apollonian order is presented as brutal and repressive, Dionysian riot as violent and destructive. Neither is morally superior option. What happens, then, when we turn the sound back on and consider the artistic ambiguity we touched upon earlier, the relationship of song to image? Apollo and Dionysus clash on screen; Will our intellectual and emotional response to the combination of song and video clash as well?

Ushered in on the pulsing throb of the song's beat after that initial flare of flame, and the mirrored image of bared teeth in the mouth of a riot-control dog and an angry rioter, we are thrust fully into the song. The opening chorus, provided by Frank Ocean, seems to issue a challenge, ending with the fine, ""What's a god to a non-believer/Who don't believe in anything?"" Jay Z's verse also adopts a similar stance, challenging both secular and religious authority, while at the same time maintaining the stance of someone not necessarily seeking to overthrow, but to find an authentic authority; one that exists beyond the venal corruption of those who currently hold power in the world.

While there is a sensation of disparity between word and image, the relationship between the two in the early parts of the song is clear. Just as Frank Ocean and Jay-Z have issued their challenge, have announced their desire to find a truer way of being in the world, the rioters can be read as fighting against an authority they view as corrupt. They rebel against the system not because they seek to destroy it, but because they wish to forge it into something better.(10) Ocean's line ""What's a mob to a king"" puts the rioters in their place. A rioting mob is nothing to a king, represented here by the police. This is chiefly due to the ease to which the nation-state can repress such uprisings. We have seen this constant refrain used by authority against rebellions and riots both in America and abroad. The heavy handed, highly weaponized force by dictators such as Bull Connor (Alabama), Daryl Gates (California), Muammar Gaddafi (Libya), Hosni Mubarak (Egypt), Bashar al-Assad (Syria), and democratically elected authoritarian leaders such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey) and Vladimir Putin (Russia), all insisting that protests against their rule was the work of animalistic thugs, anarchists, and foreign agents. Once the rioters are thus dehumanized, it becomes acceptable to use force against them, even though they are as much a part of the society as those who support the rulers. Instead of allowing a dialogue between contradictory ways of seeing the world, searching for common ground, violence is used as an answer--much as in our Nietzschean reading of how the Dionysian is violently denied and repressed by the Apollonian.

Viewing the video less literally, associating the mob on screen to the one in the lyrics, the police, the representatives of authority signify the repressive Apollonian intellect keeping the base impulses of a Dionysian rabble in check. Yet clearly they are failing, for this rioting mob clearly denies the authority of the police, just as Ocean's nonbeliever denies the existence and hence the authority of a god. As the battle rages, Jay-Z, our unseen narrator of this riot of the mind, urges us not to overthrow thought for emotion, but to unify the two.

Taken in isolation, the first half of ""No Church in the Wild"" certainly resonates with early Nietzsche. Yet as the song moves into its bridge, moving toward Kanye's verse, there is a marked shift both visually and lyrically. During the first half of the video, the police, the Apollonian forces, are clearly in control of the situation. Yet as The-Dream sings to us of desire, the fide begins to shift, with the rioters becoming the dominant force in the confrontation, reflected not only through the action in the video, but also through shifts in lighting, and even in the image of the statue. Whereas before the selection of statuary suggested a man hiding his Face in pain, shame, or impotent rage, or a Herculean figure whose raised club reflects the baton of a police officer bludgeoning a rioter, the statues shown in the second half of the video symbolize power and victory.

This is where the question of whether the video's powerful imagery is at odds with the song's content. Many critics have suggested that Kanye's paean to polyamory, his ode to the joys of sniffing cocaine from her ""black skin"" (once again we note the black/white dichotomy) conflicts with the visualization of a society in the grips of chaotic discordance. But a closer analysis suggests that this is not so. The rioters stand, as mentioned, as a Dionysian presence. They are the primal force of intoxication, of uncontrolled passion unbound. Kanye's verse stands at odds with traditional strictures; it preaches against those things we are taught are ""right"" and ""normal."" Monogamy, Kanye tells us, is not normal. It is imposed on us, and we must reject it if we are to find a better way of being. It is a Dionysian sermon, harkening back to those drunken orgies that the Maenads instigated millennia ago in praise of their god.

Thus there is no dichotomy between word and image. Kanye may sing of threesomes while police officers are set on fire, but the same language is being spoken. It is the language of Dionysus unbound, and the old order swept aside in favor of an unbridled way of being. Yet it is this very unity of word and image that causes Kanye West to fail as a Nietzschean artist. The tentative seeking with which the song opens is cast aside as West announces that we have found our new, more authentic way of being, the Dionysian way. There is no room for the Apollonian in this creed of abandon and upheaval. The Apollonian has been rejected, leaving us no better than half-alive, thus never able to find completion. The Dionysian and its excesses have eclipsed the passionless balance of the Apollonian spirit and any attempt to find a middle ground between the two. For all its passionate embrace of the physical experience, then, in the eyes of early Nietzsche West's verse is merely life-denying.

If ""No Church in the Wild"" leaves us only damned, half-alive things, how might we fare in the gaze of the man who pronounced theothanatos? The Nietzsche who wrote The Gay Science would, at first glance, seem sympathetic to the thoughts expressed in ""No Church in the Wild,"" particularly Ocean's question about the nonbeliever.

In expressing the death of God, Nictzsche announces the downfall of all order; ethics, metaphysics, faith, science, these things have all failed us. Our foundational assumptions are all deeply flawed, and our Nietzschean project is thus to forge a new way, a way that is life-affirming rather than life-denying. In this later Nietzsche we still find the recurring image of the Dionysian, though now he represents the figure of the completed man, the man who walks the life-affirming path free of the life-denying course forced on us by the death of God on the cross.(11) The death of God is the end of transcendence. God died, and was not resurrected. There are no miracles, no enchantment of the world, no divine mystery. God died and stayed dead, the result of violence was permanent.

Unfortunately, too often this Nietzsche is read as espousing mere
inversion, a replacement of all current values with their polar opposites.
Yet what Nietzsche proposes is not in fact a wholesale rejection of our
current way of being so much as a wholesale rejection of the reasons
behind our way of being. For instance, Western morality preaches
that life is sacred, and that to take life is therefore a sin. It would be
easy, sloppily simple even, to thus presume that a Nietzschean way
of being would then tell us that if life is sacred in the old order, and ÷ the old order is wrong, then life is no longer sacred and there is no
meaningful prohibition in place that prevents the taking of life. This simplistic view assumes Nietzsche to be in favor of wholesale murder. In fact, such simplistic and censored views of his philosophy did find its way into the tenets of Nazism.

Living in such a way is failing to make the move Nietzsche desired, which as he so often put it, was a move beyond good and evil, a shift to something other than morality. Merely replacing morality with antimorality does not accomplish this, because the two are still defined by the same dichotomy, rather than leaving it behind. Deciding that since, in the old view, life was held as sacred; in the new, we must hold ourselves above any stricture (legal, transcendent, or otherwise) on taking life, is to still define ourselves solely in relation to a view of the world that regards life as sacred. Rather than seeking a new way of being, rather than confronting the horrors of freedom, we have simply fooled ourselves into believing that we cannot see our chains.

A more accurate interpretation of Nietzsche, then, that what we must seek is a rejection that results in a revaluation, not an inversion, of values. In choosing to walk a Nietzschean path there is nothing that tells us we must reject life as valuable. Rather, we are told that if we are to value life then we must value life for the right reasonsÿ reasons that call to the transcendent, relying on the orders of a being whose existence Nietzsche did not acknowledge, are clearly insufficient. After all, ""What's a god to a non-believer?"" Any reason emerging from a teleological narrative is likewise worthless. To explain this Apollonian, ivory-tower word, the teleological, or ""goal-seeking,""
narrative is one that essentially guides us to live our lives for some-
thing other than living our lives. The Eden story, though it is by
no means the only example, is among the archetypal forms of the
teleological narrative. To wit: humans once lived hi paradise, they
were expelled fi'om Eden; so, we must now spend our lives rejecting
sin in the hopes of regaining entrance into paradise or heaven. If we
live according to the Edenic narrative, then we are living our lives not
for the purpose of living our lives, but solely to secure for ourselves
a place in paradise after our deaths. The danger in this is that it can
cause us to turn away from the lived reality of existence, not living
our lives for ourselves, and subjecthlg ourselves to someone, or some-
thing, else's plan. Insisting on the existence of an idea that cannot
be proven, based on revelation we are admonished to live purely for
an Apollonian idea, that is something better and transcendent. Thus
we must reject the Dionysian, that is, all the pleasures of life--food,
comfort, sex--because, as we mentioned earlier, they are irrelevant in ® the quest for the glorious realities of the next world, and indulging
in them may prevent us from reaching it. The teleological view of life does not make us behave well for the right reasons. We will behave in a moral way for the reward of entering heaven, or out of fear of going to hell, rather than because it is right to do so. Our moral actions will not necessarily mean that we are moral beings.

Even if one is to reject Nietzsche's atheism and presume that the divine exists in some form or another, to live in this way is still unhealthy. We can find this sentiment in the work of Kierkegaard, who despite his many criticisms of the church as institution still maintained his faith. Though his reasons for doing so were somewhat different from Nietzsche's, Kierkegaard too hasistcd that living our lives for the promise of heavenly reward was not only unhealthy, but actually the demonstration of a lack of faith.

Whether one sides with Kierkegaard or Nietzsche on the position of faith in the divine, at the heart of the matter is the idea that life is to be lived for the sake of life itself, and not for the sake of future reward, and not in a fashion that objectifies us. If we hold to the principle that life is of value, and thus must not be taken from another, then the source of that value can only come from within us. It is thus subjective if we wish for tiffs value to be a healthy one. We cannot decide not to kill only out of fear of the divine's riot policemen.

In light of the later work of Nietzsche, then, there is no need of an immediate rejection either of Jay-Z's questioning position, or of Kanye's embrace of hedonism. Yet we are left with a tension that must be resolved. The hedonism espoused by the song, particularly during Kanye's verse, stands in direct opposition to what we are typically taught as good and right. As such, it is not difficult to see it less as a rejection of morality than as an inversion. As discussed, this does not move us beyond good and evil, but leaves us chained to conventional morality. West answers Ocean's question ""What's a god to a nonbeliever?"" by arguing that the proper response is to indulge in everything the nonexistent god prohibited, rather than bypass these taboos and find one's own morality.

There is a latent linguistic ambiguity in Ocean's question that
sheds further light on this point. Ocean says ""nonbeliever,"" but it
is unclear exactly what this means. It might have the sense either of
""unbeliever"" or of ""atheist."" That is, if a person speaks the phrase ""I
believe ha God,"" it implies that the speaker believes in the existence
of a god. But it also powerfully implies that the speaker worships
this God. The two are not identical. It is possible to believe in the
existence of a God and yet reject him as unjust, or choose to ignore ÷ his strictures, or deliberately invert them as a way or, essentially, giv-
ing him the finger. The latter type of nonbeliever, however, has not
moved beyond God; those rules are still the defining guidelines, and
like the pure hedonist we have been looking at, is therefore not free
from God. The nonbeliever who simply denies the existence of any
divinity, on the other hand, has the ability to find a new basis for
morality. This does not necessarily mean that an atheist will do so,
merely that it is possible to. So, Ocean's question has a double answer,
depending on how we define his term. ÿlb a nonbeliever, God is either
something to be fbught against, or something to be left entirely out
of mind. Only the latter can truly be said to have moved beyond good
and evil. West, however, appears to be the fbrmer. His hedonism is
based on negation rather than creation; his embrace of the Dionysian
is not life-affirming, because it is not a search for something new but
a mirror image of the old. He rejects common morality but can offer
nothing in its place except denying it.

Though morality can be repressive, it cannot be confidently asserted that it is invariably so. As we noted, Nietzsche concluded that morality is ambiguous. Thus we may conclude that monogamy may well be as life-affirming as any other option, depending on circumstance and on those involved. Why should we value polyamory? Because it lets us fuck whomever we want? Why should we value that?

What is the value of promiscuity over monogamy? Should we value it solely because it is the opposite of what those who keep us in chains insist that we do, and thus is a path to freeing ourselves from oppression? We already know that this particular answer is a trap that not only keeps us firmly under the yoke of another, but also, as Foucault says, makes us a tool of oppression in and of ourselves. In our overt act of what we think is rejection and rebellion, we provide the systems of oppression with a tool to show the people what happens when they step out of line.

The ways in which we as a society, particularly in the modern West, consume stories of the flaws and failures of the famous, the ways in which we continue to consume their lives even while holding ourselves as :::orally, intellectually, or otherwise superior to the celebrity scapegoat of the minute, suggest that this sort of thing is a far more effective tool of control than we might like to admit.

Reactive hedonism does nothing to enrich us. It does not lib-
erate or enlighten us. In order to be considered life-affirming in a
Nietzschean perspective, some hedonistic behavior would have to
arise from the right place. While the later Nietzsche might seem to
suggest that the manner of being articulated in ""No Church in the ÷ Wild"" is a good one, in the context of the rest of the song these
hopes seem doomed to be dashed on reality's rock. Without a firmer grounding in why we should value the trappings of hedonism, the song ultimately seems nothing more than an inversion of received values. There is no freedom, Nietzschean or otherwise, to be found in the message it brings to us. After all, the video seems to portray an orgy of violence in which the distinctions between right/wrong and police/rioters and order/rebellion are swept away by the anger and rage of both sides. In their violence, they are equal and no longer distinct. There seems to be a need, then, for a new creative response that will result in life-affirming, life-sustaining forms--an Apollonian response. Inasmuch as artists serve as harbingers and visionaries, Jay-Z and West are lacking.

Yet despite his popular reputation, there is more to Kanye West than this. In his song ""Through the Wire,"" he takes an extraordinary risk for an artist immersed in the hyper-masculinized, braggadocio-ridden world of hip-hop. After surviving a car accident that shattered, West recorded a song about his recovery. This willingness to embrace risk and celebrate his smwival by rapping with a shattered jaw can be seen as a truly life-affirming act. In tragedy, in music, the walls that delineate h:dividual existence shatter and we experience a loss of ego, of individuality, of self. It is a kind of death. In tragedy, we share in the death of the tragic hero. In the procreative act, we experience the little death of rapture. But the Dionysian brings us to the brink of the abyss and shows us that our individual existence is but a fleeting illusion in the eternity of the universe. And so perhaps West is more of a Nietzschean than ""Church in the Wild"" makes him seem. On the positive side, through loss we experience, according to Nietzsche, unity with all being and with our fellow human beings in the orgiastic experience of loss of self. But we also run the danger of insight into the illusion of being and thus could collapse into madness. At this nmment, according to Nietzsche, the Apollonian resurfaces and restores the beautiful illusion of life and meaning, which we need to survive. Beauty is, according to Nietzsche, the survival instinct's response to the enormity of the Dionysian insight. ""Through the Wire"" does not reject the stereotyped strictures of the rapping life-style, it merely ignores them. It moves, that is, beyond good and evil; and praises life, not for morality or lack of morality, but simply for being life, and for being able to live.

2. Dionysian and Apollian views of art were popularized in The Birth of Tragedy (1872) as a juxtaposition or dichotomy of a rational and perfect self (Apollo) and the more irrational or emotive self (Dionysian). This is not unlike a Freudian Id and SuperEgo. But Nietzsche does not see them as hierarchical but rather as natural tension that causes the tragic to develop through is unity

8. For Nietzsche, the Dionysian represents the underlying ""will"" of which Schopenhaner speaks--it is a formless wanting, desire, motion. Out of this will, through the principium individuations, the illusory image of myriad individual existences is formed. This is the veil of Maya to which Schopenhauer refers. It is also the Apollonian

9. With regard to this cave analogy, Nietzsche would read the realm of the Apollonian as the realm of appearances but necessary appearances. This, in part, is because he would reject the platonic ideal forms as true forms, other than their rising from the will's need to populate the universe with images/illusions. This also has a Schopenhauer quality to it

I0. When discussing this matter in a interview with a colleague, Dr. Timothy Bennett, Wittenberg University, he pushed me further with this claim by asserting ""I think the desire 'to forge' something better is a good Apollonian impulse and wonder if this suggests the necessary partnership of both Apollonian and Dionysian (a necessary partnership according to Nietzsche as well). If so, then it might be necessary not to see the Apollonian as repressing the Dionysian. In fact, by challenging moribund forms, the Dionysian might be liberating energies which begin destructively but could empower a newer, more vital set of forms, i.e. they would revitalize the Apollonian.""

11. Nietzsche's Madman also asks what new sacred games and rituals need to be invented now that God has been murdered by our scientific culture and challenges us to become God-like, to become creative, to give birth to a new humanity in response to this crime of deceit. According to my colleague Timothy Bennett, ""Nothing seems to have disturbed Nietzsche more than modern culture's inability to give rise to a new religion adequate to its challenges. One could read much of his work as an attempt to develop a new sense of the sacred.""",misc

One decision left everything frozen in time, always

Do you remember what was promised?
Was it destiny to you?
Was it heaven? You can't see
All invisible to you
To you

Can't turn back from the path that you laid
It's how souls (Souls) get lost and betrayed

This fragile thing we held so tightly to
Unraveling and closing in on you, on you

Do you remember what was promised?
Was it destiny to you?
Was it heaven? You can't see
All invisible to you
To you, to you, to you

Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared, that went unshared
Until it died within his silence

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again

And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing solitaire

A little hope goes up in smoke
Just how it goes, goes without saying
There was a man, a lonely man
Who would command the hand he's playing

And solitaire's the only game in town
And every road that takes him takes him down
And by himself it's easy to pretend
He'll never love again
And keeping to himself he plays the game
Without her love it always ends the same

Like some friendships when your money's gone
Love stands in with the loan sharks when your heart's in pawn

If I had some strong wings like an aeroplane
Had some broad wings like some aeroplane
I would fly away forever
Never to come again
For love oh love oh loveless love
Has set our hearts are gold-less gold
From milk-less milk and silk-less silk
We are growing used to soul-less souls

Such grafting times we never saw
That's why we have a pure full law
In everything we find a flaw

2749,"Intro [Sample of Alina Baraz & Galimatias’ “Drift”]
I only miss you when the sun goes down
Oh, your voice is my favorite sound
Swaying like the palm trees
You and me, we’re poetry
Painting stories…

[Verse 1]
I’m picking at the dirt
Looking at the finer things I never thought’d work
I got a smirk on my face, I been working away
Trying to live it up while everybody’s turnt
I wanna blow like Kurt
Get some better money and then get some better shirts
I been acting kinda funny and my honey
She been saying I don’t put her first, I don’t put her first
In the middle of a tiff I’m gonna split and take a sip of another burr
I wanna take a stride out of my mind
Maybe take a step into another world
But these other girls don’t cut my world
She think I’m gonna leave her for another girl
Think I’mma deceiver, but I need her, do I need her?
I know for sure that I need her, need to love that girl
She don’t know how I feel
Oh, my God, it’s real
Feel like I’m grippin’ the steel when I flip how I feel after she get to grillin’ me
[Hook 1]
But my hands are tied
Try to build a life that we both fantasize
Run from the fuck-ups but I can not hide
She said that she’s the number one fan of mine

[Verse 2]
Then how can I let her down
If she is my queen and she gives me my crown?
What is my reason for being so scheming
If she’d never let me drown?
The screaming, she’s crying, the breathing, she’s heaving
I tell her she gettin’ upset for no reason
She says I should leave and I tell her I’m leavin’
I go down the street to Maria’s to drink and
I’m back in the saddle, I’m holding the reigns
Back and forth, playin’ pong with a paddle
I’m battling demons, I’m mad at my demons
Jack Daniels got me in a dance with my demons
She don’t know what I’m thinking
We so irate, it drives me to drinking
Hibernate in a drunken slumber
Fucked up through a cycle of seasons, uh
She tell me my problems have got out of hand
And I can’t seem to solve ‘em
Wish I could dump ‘em inside of a tub filled with lye to dissolve ‘em
Take a lighter to all ‘em
And burn ‘em up just like Nuevo Leon did
But I can not, I can not
There ain’t a quick fix, so I gotta be cautious
[Hook 2]
I apologized
Try to build a house to hold all those lies
Try to run ahead but I fall to the side
Pissed and now she’s missing those calls of mine

[Verse 3]
A couple of broken people
Stuck in a song like a broken needle
She can tell all her friends that we fight
But they don’t know what we know
I’m sick and I’m tired, convinced I’m a liar, she’s rid of desire
She said go to hell but I been in this fire
I’ve come way too far to just sit and retire it, uh
I could give it my all but if I trip and I fall then it’s never enough
And this medicine’s tough
I think back to times in 2014 when she’d end it abrupt
I said I’d be different, she said it’s a bluff
I’m guessing that this mess is present because
A man of his word wouldn’t get it so rough
So I’m sorry, but I know I’ve said that enough
Communication been breaking but I am not ready to let it go vacant
I got my face in the dirt but I’m aiming for first in her head as my placement
If you got to question or not if I’m invested or not
Then you best reconsider
You are the best fucking thing I can see, and I mean it
I know that I got to deliver it, uh",rap

Deserted? They don't a trainer so they just run wild and play tricks on the whole town

Squirtle. This tiny turtle Pokemon draws its long neck into its shell to launch critical water attacks with amazing range and accuracy
""That Squirtle is following us""
The blast can be quite powerful

In a drop top looking like I'm Lindsay Lohan
Pit stop, liquor shop, copping Captain Morgan

Wheezing and coughing feel like a Pokemon
Fuck with the Czar I hail from the Romanov

Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
Sayin' something about a queen
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming
And the archer split the tree

There was a fanfare blowing to the sun
There was floating on the breeze
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the Twentieth Century
Look at Mother Nature on the run
In the Twentieth Century

I was lying in a burned out basement
With the full moon in my eyes
I was hoping for replacement
When the sun burst through the sky

There was a band playing in my head
And I felt like I could cry
I was thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie
Thinking about what a friend had said
I was hoping it was a lie

I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow haze of the sun
There were children crying and colors flying
All around the chosen ones

All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed
To a new home

Lusting on stars but dream about mars where fake is feared by bravest
Switching your sides, you paying a lot no wonder you broke and this big
My actions are too mouthed I Stan be
I hit from face till it hit the sea
My niggas too dope to get a B
The talking is senseful you can't reach

Man, humble yourself
Let it be big I still push on myself
I started so young and the time was enough
If I had to stop, it would have to be God!

I cannot be famous and ditch on myself
I got my own niggas on dial
Steady maintaining our greatness to loud

Dollar on the sky no limits
Sorry bout your dad, let your colors bring peace

Didn't have to hear it from somebody

Put my ego in a side dish, broke a broken a heart to limits
Met the gang and I knew nothing

Losing negativity in my space
Positivity I'm giving it in sideways
Learn to give your all just in one phase
Burn a bridge and leave the city with a light stain

To satiate the compelling need to dominate
A shallow sentiment in distorted mind
Inimically assigned to carry out design

They make peace in destructive frame of mind
We're left waiting at the end of the line
We're marching towards the end of mankind

While the white-collar criminals are calling the shots
While cooperating the profit and the power
Drain the money out and drop them from the top

Feeding off the weak and selling out our lives
Reap the unsown and live high for a while
Indulging in synthetic opulence
Drain the money out

As the waves crash over me
And it pours in my heart and heads back to the sea
As the waves crash over me
All the troubled thoughts are washed away from me

Short-term gains and long-term pain
You can try but it's never gonna change me
I've got heart and I will stay strong for every true word is a promise worth keeping

The earth will not forgive

We deny whats essential to behold
We're lied to, I can see right through
The veils that's been raised while the world is sleeping

They are all around you no matter where you go
In avoidance of feelings there's no care for the world
Grandstanding, untrustworthy
Devoid of shame and guilt
It is by those same methods that the modern wold is build
It's in this sinking feeling where all troubled thoughts are washed away and now
The ocean lives in me, the ocean lives in me

As the waves, crash over me
And it pours in my heart and heads back to the sea
As the waves, crash over me and the ocean lives in me

Devoid of shame and fucking guilt",rock

Where I'm from was dilapidated
I can say this: destruction's what that created
All shade, it's only ball players, rappers made it
The youth clings, the only two things that captivated
I chop it up and let what's said simmer
Was always fed before I was fed dinner
Was urged from birth, felt the burden of breadwinning
My young gripes was some nights went to bed thinner
Everybody up
Sentiments like I was sent from the seminary
Rap feats took a backseat, I had men to bury
Taint living, ain't tripping if money's our itinerary
Pro's is those before cons, I was in already
Everybody up
Not a sex villain, raised to respect women, ""no"" is ""no""
It's facts, God, when blacks rob, all we know is woe
It's no wins in them times, went blow-for-blow
That hand-to-hand had us going toe-to-toe
There was no one I feared
But the night Shane died was the moment I veered
Though I slid, still endeared, so it appeared
I'm in my winter, you can tell by the snow on my beard

Gon' take more than what you got for Ka to yield
Build 'til my pot is filled or in potter's field
I did it without a shield
I'm past how it sound, I ask how it feel (how it feel?)

No gifts, but always police presence
Stopped putting in work, a complete severance
In this labyrinth, arrogance defeats blessings

Past Mistakes Led Us

To grow Wise

To spot anybody plotting our demise

I had a boo in Malibu

Who flew around the world

Just to avoid the pain she felt
Back home

I met a bad chick living in the Hamptons

With her grandparents
Well I mean it was just mostly her in a whole ass mansion

She be telling me

What's the point to have all these rooms

If all you’ve known since ya youth

Was feeling empty

Popping pills just so

It don't hit as heavy

So with that said

I'll go when I'm ready

Past struggles and hardships

Reminding  me on how everyday startеd

Thinking those from my life that dearly dеparted

Rest in peace
I know for a fact my life without y'all have been missing’ a piece

To my homies having kids

I wish y'all nothing but the best

I just wish some of y'all would give up
That bullet proof vest

It's a scary sentiment

The bad vibes we can't let 'em in

Don’t worry when I make it

That mean We made it

I’ll write each of y’all a check

So we can give it a rest

No more petty cash scams on Zelle

We aiming for generational wealth

It’s been a battle with heaven and hell
I’m here to claim what’s mine

Had to hustle hard since I was nine

From washing dishes

Soon to be with celebrity kisses

TMZ Drama with the misses

Love letters to my future wifey

Please have some patients with me
They say love is blind
That would explain
How I end up in these different beds at night

A dream chaser
An upcoming music innovator
The one where you read
On the Sunday paper
Love to all my haters, bless those who treated me lesser
I wouldn't eat better, sleep better, be better

Hey yo its been a long day think its time to kick it back
Looking fresh in a button up jeans and snapback
If its forward I mean business if its backward I'm just chilling
What you doing in the living room? Boy I'm just living
Beer and a sandwich in the early afternoon
I am not a morning person guess you'll see me after noon
Take computers everywhere man cuz every where's my room
Get ready for my rain bitch something like a monsoon
Its CB radio bitch you know you've been waitin'
Keep your hand off of the dial no need to change the station
I always keep it blazin' the music and the weed
I can get you anything shit just tell me what you need
Cuz I'm kind of like a genie and if you rub me the right way

Going hard on the beat I don't want to let up

6065,"         A high, rocky shore of the lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz.
         The lake makes a bend into the land; a hut stands at a short
         distance from the shore; the fisher boy is rowing about in his
         boat. Beyond the lake are seen the green meadows, the hamlets,
         and arms of Schwytz, lying in the clear sunshine. On the left
         are observed the peaks of the Hacken, surrounded with clouds; to
         the right, and in the remote distance, appear the Glaciers. The
         Ranz des Vaches, and the tinkling of cattle-bells, continue for
         some time after the rising of the curtain.

FISHER BOY
(sings in his boat).
Melody of the Ranz des Vaches.

         The clear, smiling lake wooed to bathe in its deep,
         A boy on its green shore had laid him to sleep;
                 Then heard he a melody
                         Flowing and soft,
                 And sweet, as when angels
                         Are singing aloft.
         And as thrilling with pleasure he wakes from his rest,
         The waters are murmuring over his breast;
                 And a voice from the deep cries,
                         ""With me thou must go,
                 I charm the young shepherd,
                         I lure him below.""
HERDSMAN
(on the mountains).
Air.—Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.

                 Farewell, ye green meadows,
                         Farewell, sunny shore,
                 The herdsman must leave you,
                         The summer is o'er.
         We go to the hills, but you'll see us again,
         When the cuckoo is calling, and wood-notes are gay,
         When flowerets are blooming in dingle and plain,
         And the brooks sparkle up in the sunshine of May.
                 Farewell, ye green meadows,
                         Farewell, sunny shore,
                 The herdsman must leave you,
                         The summer is o'er.

CHAMOIS HUNTER
(appearing on the top of a cliff).
Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.

         On the heights peals the thunder, and trembles the bridge,
         The huntsman bounds on by the dizzying ridge,
                 Undaunted he hies him
                         O'er ice-covered wild,
                 Where leaf never budded,
                         Nor spring ever smiled;
         And beneath him an ocean of mist, where his eye
         No longer the dwellings of man can espy;
                 Through the parting clouds only
                         The earth can be seen,
                 Far down 'neath the vapor
                         The meadows of green.
[A change comes over the landscape. A rumbling, cracking
noise is heard among the mountains. Shadows of clouds sweep
across the scene.

[RUODI, the fisherman, comes out of his cottage. WERNI, the
huntsman, descends from the rocks. KUONI, the shepherd, enters,
with a milk pail on his shoulders, followed by SERPI, his assistant.

RUODI.
Bestir thee, Jenni, haul the boat on shore.
The grizzly Vale-king 1 comes, the glaciers moan,
The lofty Mytenstein 2 draws on his hood,
And from the Stormcleft chilly blows the wind;
The storm will burst before we are prepared.

KUONI.
'Twill rain ere long; my sheep browse eagerly,
And Watcher there is scraping up the earth.

WERNI.
The fish are leaping, and the water-hen
Dives up and down. A storm is coming on.

KUONI
(to his boy).
Look, Seppi, if the cattle are not straying.
SEPPI. There goes brown Liesel, I can hear her bells.

KUONI.
Then all are safe; she ever ranges farthest.

RUODI.
You've a fine yoke of bells there, master herdsman.

WERNI.
And likely cattle, too. Are they your own?

KUONI.
I'm not so rich. They are the noble lord's
Of Attinghaus, and trusted to my care.

RUODI.
How gracefully yon heifer bears her ribbon!

KUONI.
Ay, well she knows she's leader of the herd,
And, take it from her, she'd refuse to feed.

RUODI.
You're joking now. A beast devoid of reason.

WERNI.
That's easy said. But beasts have reason too—
And that we know, we men that hunt the chamois.
They never turn to feed—sagacious creatures!
Till they have placed a sentinel ahead,
Who pricks his ears whenever we approach,
And gives alarm with clear and piercing pipe.

RUODI (to the shepherd).
Are you for home?

KUONI.
The Alp is grazed quite bare.

WERNI.
A safe return, my friend!

KUONI.
The same to you?
Men come not always back from tracks like yours.

RUODI.
But who comes here, running at topmost speed?

WERNI.
I know the man; 'tis Baumgart of Alzellen.

CONRAD BAUMGARTEN
(rushing in breathless).
For God's sake, ferryman, your boat!

RUODI.
How now?
Why all this haste?

BAUMGARTEN.
Cast off! My life's at stake!
Set me across!

KUONI.
Why, what's the matter, friend?

WERNI.
Who are pursuing you? First tell us that.

BAUMGARTEN
(to the fisherman).
Quick, quick, even now they're close upon my heels!
The viceroy's horsemen are in hot pursuit!
I'm a lost man should they lay hands upon me.

RUODI.
Why are the troopers in pursuit of you?

BAUMGARTEN.
First save my life and then I'll tell you all.

WERNI.
There's blood upon your garments—how is this?

BAUMGARTEN.
The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg.

KUONI.
How! What! The Wolfshot? 3 Is it he pursues you?

BAUMGARTEN.
He'll ne'er hunt man again; I've settled him.

ALL
(starting back).
Now, God forgive you, what is this you've done!

BAUMGARTEN.
What every free man in my place had done.
I have but used mine own good household right
'Gainst him that would have wronged my wife—my honor.

KUONI.
And has he wronged you in your honor, then?

BAUMGARTEN.
That he did not fulfil his foul desire
Is due to God and to my trusty axe.

WERNI.
You've cleft his skull, then, have you, with your axe?

KUONI.
Oh, tell us all! You've time enough, before
The boat can be unfastened from its moorings.

BAUMGARTEN.
When I was in the forest, felling timber,
My wife came running out in mortal fear:
""The seneschal,"" she said, ""was in my house,
Had ordered her to get a bath prepared,
And thereupon had taken unseemly freedoms,
From which she rid herself and flew to me.""
Armed as I was I sought him, and my axe
Has given his bath a bloody benediction.

WERNI.
And you did well; no man can blame the deed.

KUONI.
The tyrant! Now he has his just reward!
We men of Unterwald have owed it long.

BAUMGARTEN.
The deed got wind, and now they're in pursuit.
Heavens! whilst we speak, the time is flying fast.

[It begins to thunder.

KUONI.
Quick, ferrymen, and set the good man over.

RUODI.
Impossible! a storm is close at hand,
Wait till it pass! You must.

BAUMGARTEN.
Almighty heavens!
I cannot wait; the least delay is death.

KUONI
(to the fisherman).
Push out. God with you! We should help our neighbors;
The like misfortune may betide us all.

[Thunder and the roaring of the wind.

RUODI.
The south wind's up! 4 See how the lake is rising!
I cannot steer against both storm and wave.

BAUMGARTEN (clasping him by the knees).
God so help you, as now you pity me!

WERNI.
His life's at stake. Have pity on him, man!

KUONI.
He is a father: has a wife and children.

[Repeated peals of thunder.

RUODI.
What! and have I not, then, a life to lose,
A wife and child at home as well as he?
See, how the breakers foam, and toss, and whirl,
And the lake eddies up from all its depths!
Right gladly would I save the worthy man,
But 'tis impossible, as you must see.

BAUMGARTEN
(still kneeling).
Then must I fall into the tyrant's hands,
And with the port of safety close in sight!
Yonder it lies! My eyes can measure it,
My very voice can echo to its shores.
There is the boat to carry me across,
Yet must I lie here helpless and forlorn.

KUONI.
Look! who comes here?

RUODI.
'Tis Tell, brave Tell, of Buerglen. 5

[Enter TELL, with a crossbow.

TELL.
Who is the man that here implores for aid?

KUONI.
He is from Alzellen, and to guard his honor
From touch of foulest shame, has slain the Wolfshot!
The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg.
The viceroy's troopers are upon his heels;
He begs the boatman here to take him over,
But he, in terror of the storm, refuses.

RUODI.
Well, there is Tell can steer as well as I.
He'll be my judge, if it be possible.

[Violent peals of thunder—the lake becomes more tempestuous.

Am I to plunge into the jaws of hell?
I should be mad to dare the desperate act.

TELL.
The brave man thinks upon himself the last.
Put trust in God, and help him in his need!

RUODI.
Safe in the port, 'tis easy to advise.
There is the boat, and there the lake! Try you!

TELL.
The lake may pity, but the viceroy will not.
Come, venture, man!

SHEPHERD and HUNTSMAN.
Oh, save him! save him! save him!

RUODI.
Though 'twere my brother, or my darling child,
I would not go. It is St. Simon's day,
The lake is up, and calling for its victim.

TELL.
Naught's to be done with idle talking here.
Time presses on—the man must be assisted.
Say, boatman, will you venture?

RUODI.
No; not I.

TELL.
In God's name, then, give me the boat! I will
With my poor strength, see what is to be done!

KUONI.
Ha, noble Tell!

WERNI.
That's like a gallant huntsman!

BAUMGARTEN.
You are my angel, my preserver, Tell.

TELL.
I may preserve you from the viceroy's power
But from the tempest's rage another must.
Yet you had better fall into God's hands,
Than into those of men.
[To the herdsman.
Herdsman, do thou
Console my wife, should aught of ill befall me.
I do but what I may not leave undone.

[He leaps into the boat.

KUONI
(to the fisherman).
A pretty man to be a boatman, truly!
What Tell could risk you dared not venture on.

RUODI.
Far better men than I would not ape Tell.
There does not live his fellow 'mong the mountains.

WERNI
(who has ascended a rock).
He pushes off. God help thee now, brave sailor!
Look how his bark is reeling on the waves!

KUONI
(on the shore).
The surge has swept clean over it. And now
'Tis out of sight. Yet stay, there 'tis again
Stoutly he stems the breakers, noble fellow!

SEPPI.
Here come the troopers hard as they can ride!

KUONI.
Heavens! so they do! Why, that was help, indeed.

[Enter a troop of horsemen.

FIRST HORSEMAN.
Give up the murderer! You have him here!

SECOND HORSEMAN.
This way he came! 'Tis useless to conceal him!

RUODI and KUONI.
Whom do you mean?

FIRST HORSEMAN
(discovering the boat).
The devil! What do I see?

WERNI
(from above).
Is't he in yonder boat ye seek? Ride on,
If you lay to, you may o'ertake him yet.

SECOND HORSEMAN.
Curse on you, he's escaped!

FIRST HORSEMAN
(to the shepherd and fisherman).
You helped him off,
And you shall pay for it. Fall on their herds!
Down with the cottage! burn it! beat it down!

[They rush off.

SEPPI
(hurrying after them).
Oh, my poor lambs!

KUONI
(following him).
Unhappy me, my herds!

WERNI.
The tyrants!

RUODI
(wringing his hands).
Righteous Heaven! Oh, when will come
Deliverance to this devoted land?

[Exeunt severally.

1533,"The beginning of everything: the Big Bang. The idea that the universe was suddenly born and is not infinite. Out of the middle of the twentieth century, most scientists thought of the universe as infinite and ageless. Until Einstein's theory of relativity gave us a better understanding of gravity and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another in a way that fits previous predictions. In 1964 by accident, cosmic background radiation was discovered, a relic of the early universe which together with other observational evidence made the Big Bang the accepted theory in science. Since then, improved technology like the Hubble telescope has given us a pretty good picture of the Big Bang and the structure of the cosmos. Recent observations even seem to suggest that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, but how did this Big Bang work? How can something come from nothing? Let's explore what we know

We can ignore the beginning part for now. First of all, the Big Bang was not an explosion. It was all space stretching everywhere all at once. The universe started very, very, very small, and quickly expanded to the size of a football. The universe didn't expand into anything; space was just expanding into itself. The universe cannot expand into anything, because the universe has no borders. There is, by definition, no ""outside the universe"". The universe is all there is

In this hot dense environment, energy manifested itself in particles that existed only for the tiniest glimpses of time. From gluons, pairs of quarks were created which destroyed one another, perhaps after giving off more gluons. These found other short lived quarks to interact with, forming new quark pairs and gluons again. Matter and energy were not just ""theoretically"" equivalent; it was so hot, they were practically the same stuff. Somewhere around this time, matter won over anti-matter. Today we're left with almost all matter and nearly no anti-matter at all. Somehow, one-billion-and-one matter particles were formed for every billion particles of anti-matter

Instead of one ultimate force in the universe, there were now several refined versions of it acting under different rules. By now the universe has stretched to a billion kilometres in diameter, which leads to a decrease in temperature. The cycle of quarks being born and converted back to energy suddenly stops; from now on, we work with what we have. Quarks begin forming new particles, hadrons, like protons and neutrons. There are many, many combinations of quarks that can form all sorts of hadrons, but only very few are reasonably stable for any length of time. Please take a moment to appreciate that by now, only a second has passed since the beginning of everything

The universe which has grown to 100 billion kilometres, is now cold enough to allow most of the neutrons to decay into protons and form the first atom, hydrogen. Imagine the universe at this point as an extremely hot soup, 10 billion degrees celsius, filled with countless particles and energy. Over the next few minutes, things cooled and settled down very fast. Atoms formed out of hadrons and electrons, making for a stable and electrically neutral environment. Some call this period the dark age, because there were no stars and the hydrogen gas didn't allow visible light to move around. But what's the meaning of visible light anyway, when there's nothing alive yet that could have eyes? When the hydrogen gas clumped together after millions of years and gravity put it under great pressure, stars and galaxies began to form. Their radiation dissolved the stable hydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates the universe today and allows visible light to pass. Finally, there was light

Okay, but what about the part we didn't talk about? What happened right at the beginning? This part can be defined as the Big Bang. We don't know at all what happened here. At this point, our tools break down. Natural laws stop making sense; time itself becomes wibbly-wobbly. To understand what happened here, we need a theory that unifies Einsteins relativity and quantum mechanics: something countless scientists are working on right now. But this leaves us with lots of unanswered questions. Were there universes before our own? Is this the first and only universe? What started the Big Bang or did it just occur naturally based on laws we don't understand yet? We don't know and maybe we never will. But what we do know is that the universe as we know it, started here and gave birth to particles, galaxies, stars, the Earth, and you. Since we ourselves are made of dead stars, we are not separate from the universe; we are a part of it. You could even say that we are the universes way of experiencing itself, so lets keep on experiencing it until there are no more questions to ask",pop

How did my life become a mess

Remembering your words so cruel
And how they made me feel a fool
I'm not ashamed to say I cried
You hurt me, I'm not going to lie
What happened to this love of ours
I thought it was written in the stars
I always thought it was meant to last?
But the present cannot heal the past
Because I can't forget those words you said
They keep on playing in my head
Like a broken record stuck in a groove
Yet if I end it now, what will that prove?
Your apology was good to hear
But it didn't really stop my fear
That what we had is gone for good
So can I forgive you? I know I should!

And I obsess over patterns I thought I knew
I'm learning to discern between what is and isn't there

But I still hear the rhythm and I still love the rain
And I still miss the scent when it's all gone away
And I still don't remember but at the same time can't forget
I attempted to embrace each drop but all I get is wet

But I fake a smile, I lie, ""I'm fine""
In this dim life, I've never once seen the sun shine
Repressed memories have made me hard and cold
And although you see me laugh and smile, underneath I'm fucking depressed
Recently I've made my life a train wreck, a giant mess
So on this album I'm ready to address
My faults, get up off the wall
Tone down the verbal assault, I'm not crazy, I don't do bath salts
But my whole, entire existence is false
My heart has been shot
I'm lying in a puddle of vomit as my chest bleeds out
It's without a doubt, no one hears me when I shout
I can scream as loud as I want, nobody ever hears the sound
All I can hear is the rain as it pounds against the glass of the window to my soul

7241,"Let me tell you about this girl named Julia
Her parents never let her go out as a kid
They never had birthdays or vacations or Christmas
They just sat at home and watched paint dry all day

She's never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming never coming home
Never coming home
Yeah she's never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming never coming home
Never coming home

He speaks when she can't hear
He talks with his mouth glued to the door
He feigns sick when he wants to
She comes when his spoon hits the floor

The fist shaped hole covered wall
The bite marks plastering her forearm
The phantom pressure of a hand around your neck
And she wonders if there's any way out
Julia, Julia
You truly are peculiar

He walks with chains tied to his ankle
She follows him with the weight of the world on her shoulders
She feeds him when he's hungry
He bites the hand that has no choice but to feed him

And sometimes I wish I was someone else
Wish I could get some alone time
Cos it's been a long time
And sometimes I wish you would disappear
Find your way up and leave and get the hell out of here
We are just sitting around and killing time, I hope you don't mind?

Never coming (X a whole damn bunch. 32 I think)

The way she walks sounds alarms
(She wears long sleeve shirts in the summer)
She wears sunglasses inside
(100 degrees all covered up)
Ask her why she's wearing them
(She says she just doesn't get very hot)
And she'll tell you that she's high
(But we all know that's not why she's all covered up)
The patchwork plaster on the wall
Just big enough to put his hands through
The clock stays frozen on their dresser
She watches it while he's asleep and waits for it to change

The fist shaped hole covered wall
The bite marks plastering her forearm
The phantom pressure of a hand around your neck
And she wonders if there's any way out

Peach in the fingers of a certain lover’s hand.
Peach juice sliding down the wrist of a man
with assertive hungers. Peach, bringer
of rapture: the climax, but not
the fall. Peach sky rising up and up, free
of consequence. Impossible, but for
our chase of it. Peach in the crisper drawer,
softening. We hear stories of the pastor
and his book, so certain of fire, his biblical
calculus. Peach hot, sugared in an oven.
The mouth of red around the brain-
shaped, dumbstruck stone. Peach the very taste
of sin. Peach that sends the crows circling,

But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew

See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Maserati
As we come and blaze you niggas body

Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and gambling than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day
It's all work and no play

Too bad u turned to a liar

How could you live without me
No reason its surprising

Just you and me and Marty
Not too much but was something

Hitting myself with a broom

To spend my days next to you
Yet all you see is my money

It's clearly not that you care
Thought maybe we could just share
The pain we have as a pair
It's what you do that defines you not whatever is inside you
Don't let the flesh to control you or I will always remind you
It cost you

The ones you love disowned you

Her world has changed, she asks God why
Her only son has died, and now her daughter cries

Another war to fight, there's no regard for life
How do they sleep at night, how can we make things right?
Just wanna make this right

We believe, we believe in this love

Human in all our ways and all our pain (So let it be)
There's a love that could fall down like rain (Let us see)
Let forgiveness wash away the pain (What we need)
And no one really knows what they are searching for (We believe)
This world is crying for so much more

Shout out Dakari
Shout out Ash, shout out Jessie, shout out to Game
It’s like we always do it this time
Just take it to myself like, yeah, uh, uh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Starin’ at a blank canvas
Thinkin’ about what should I write, should I plan this?
Reminiscing 18, a freshman on campus
With dreams so big, nobody understands us
Till they came true, started goin’ bananas
Somewhere along the road, I got us as lost as Atlantis
Been there since Vegas, drinking under cabanas
And medicine for breakups, take the pills life hand us
No sleep, I been up for a couple of days
Can’t nobody talk to him, been stuck in my ways
They say it’s “unsustainable”, but fuck it, it pays
Results and results, keep runnin’ them plays
I see the writings on the wall, that shit’s gеtting clear
My new girl says she lovе me, but I don’t even hear her
I can’t even drive a Jag’, that shit is inferior
Only time I see a threat, when I look in the mirror
[Chorus: Lil Wayne & (G-Eazy)]
Yeah, they only love you (Ay) when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’ (Uh), yeah (You know)
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah (I’d rather be alone, uh)
They only love you when you’re gone
It don’t matter where you goin’ (Yeah), yeah (Uh)
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone (Yeah)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Yeah, the greatest gift is knowledge itself
They fail to talk about my journey with mission and wealth
I made it here all by my lonely, no askin’ for help
What if my debut never dropped and got kept up on a shelf
Uh, finna sour a grape slowly
A black leather, slicked back, they want the old G
“Things are happening again”, that’s what they told me
I came home, full circle, not as an OG
Blink my eyes to my surprise, I’m in Tokyo
20,000 in the crowd singing every quote
Blink again and they kickin’ me out of Canada
I swear you wouldn’t have the stomach or the stamina
Yeah, my shoulders carry over 20 tons
Biggie said there’s more problems when the money comes
My songs speak to the greats, hear the one-on-ones
I’mma go out as a legend when it’s said and done
[Chorus: Lil Wayne & (G-Eazy)]
Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, (Where you goin’, uh) yeah
But I did it on my own (On my own)
So I’d rather be alone, yeah (I’d rather be alone, yeah)
They only love you when you’re gone (Yeah)
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, they say fortune only favors the bold
Stacks so big, I can’t get this paper to fold
North Oakland, North Pole, we came from the cold
Solidify my legacy when my story is told
Yeah, spent a ticket on this new Dior
Fuck a hit, this shit is what I do it for
So these bars will always be apart of me
Right now, I feel like track 2 on Tha Carter III
Uh, like I’m 2008 Nola
This shit is bubblin’ and I don’t even drink soda
The whole industry was givin’ me a cold shoulder
And now my record label needs me to make quota
Uh, this all facts and every bar is real
In twenty years, pray to God I’m makin’ art still
I’m letting everything go like a yard sale
'Cause my songs will beat longer than my heart will, uh
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah
They only love you when you’re gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I got it on my own, so I’d rather die alone

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, who put this shit together? I put this shit together
I’mma wear all my chains like some Olympic medals
They think it’s all a game, so I’m thinking winning record
They think it Kurt Cobain, but I’m thinking living legend
I’m straight to the Hall Of Fame, straight from the hallways of the ghetto
It’s fuck the world, fuck 12, since I was like 10-11
I built the whole fucking mountain, I started out with a pebble
That money talk, that’s a convo
If you broke then that’s a lecture
I does me, cause only God can judge me
Nigga trust me, only I can trust me
Yeah it’s just me, and the skies above me
But I dug deep, now close your eyes and come see
Will they love me when I’m gone? Will they know me?
Do they love me when I’m home or when I’m O.T.?
I’m here, I don’t know how long before I won’t be
So when I’m gone, how long will they mourn me?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, they only love you when you gone
It don’t matter where you goin’, yeah
But I did it on my own
So I’d rather be alone, yeah

I would feel better when I hear me, say (What?)

A half a G and E&J out in the big park
When it got dark, we occasionally let the fifth bark
You was a hustler, I was a rhyme writer
You would serve customers, I would ignite cyphers
We rode around, try and get ass in a white Mazda
'til one day you just disappeared like my father (hey)
'Member you talkin 'bout that out-of-town dough, you was drunk
Most of the time I ain't think you'd be out, yo, you was drunk Most of the time I ain't think you'd be out, yo
Sure did, took your wife and your kid out to P-A
Right around my B-day, guess you had it mapped out
Always knew the crack route
Had them kids in that small town shook rollin dice with your gat out
I visited time to time, I had to check my dude
You had the hoes on a string, they always blessed the crew
A shotgun shell turned my man flesh to stew
Damn Jizz, we miss you

Block Royal emblem on your Polo tee
Handsome nigga, no homo B, you had that glow though see
I 'member you asked why I'm so low-key
With such a fire mixtape I need a promo V
You introduced me to the family, took it out to Jers'
Studio in the basement when I pronounce the words
Studio in the basement when I pronounce the words
I 'member you goin crazy, ""Told you he get his flame on""
Right after that's when you introduced me to Akon

I find that all my charm wears off after a couple drinks
Anyone with their antennas up can see that I’m high
A Fatbrokeloser with dishonest thoughts of being somebody
A sad dude looking for a ticket to ride
I wondered why my nephew scared me so much and then I figured it out
I hate myself so much why would I make a new me
Maybe he’ll be better, an upgrade, a standout
A college essay who overcomes his upbringing

I used to talk to Jesus
Now I’m drunk and talking to myself
Used to think I was someone
Now I see that I’m someone else
Used to think I was Jesus
Sent down here as God’s own son
Thought that everybody loved me
Now I see I was the only one
The only one
The only one
The only one

Maybe I loved you or maybe just got used to you being here
But by the end it was clear that we had drifted apart
I wonder what kind of plans God has for you basic bitches
People spend their whole life trying to find love
Me, I spend more time scheming ways to put an end to myself
Or at least pull a blanket over all of the noise
But I ain’t gonna give the ghost up ‘til my name’s in your mouth
Not because you love me, girl, but because you can’t escape my voice

Well I used to talk to Jesus
Now I’m drunk and talking to myself
Used to think I was someone
Now I see that I’m someone else
Used to try to act like Jesus
Sent down here as God’s own son
Thought that everybody needed me

Mayday!

[Verse 1 - Cruger]
Mayday Mayday, it's the rape tape
I'm eating my organs hoping that they land in the same place
Ain't shaved in years, caveman's beard
Take it as a compliment when they say I'm weird
Need to lay off beer and quit smoking
Showing off my muscles by ripping my skin open
I could build Rome in a day
Blow up estates by throwing grenades over the gates
Drop bombs not beats
I'm an obscene beast with strong teeth, but I've only got three
Lay my vengeance upon thee
Watch police, entire SWAT teams couldn't stop me
Barking mad up the wrong tree
All the best rappers are dead, that's why we're zombies
Ungodly, so soulless it seems
Automatic doors won't open for me
[Hook x2]
[Scratching]
Became a monster, need I remind you?
Shotty in the trunk and on my ankle is a 9 too
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
Became a monster, need I remind you
You ain't no enemy, my friends are worse
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out

[Verse 2 - Lord Measle]
I ride an ice cream truck so kids can come to me
Tell them just on front, I'll give you one for free
I wright ransoms with my right hand
So on trial they can’t be matched with my rhyme pad
Resurrected before life
I died and decided to get out of the white chalk lines
Snatch kids from your community
And stalk women cause when they run in heels it amuses me
Corpses are picked apart, found missing arms
And then kept with other body pieces in killing jars
But it's not crime, this is art
And I'm trying to make the perfect bitch outta my victims parts
I don't show no peace and love
Born again Satanist, rising out of sea of blood
If you see me run, don't think police with come
Six percent of rapes get solved, that motivates me to fuck

Became a monster need I remind you?
Shotty in the trunk and on my ankle is a 9 too
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out

Got a method to make sure wack rappers don’t make a comeback

Words of infamy
Sowed seeds of blinding hate

Blind follow blind along the blood trails
Orders form a chain of command
While leaders wait and watch in deathly silence

5502,"Razumihin waked up next morning at eight o'clock, troubled and serious. He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities. He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly unattainable—so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties bequeathed him by that ""thrice accursed yesterday.""

The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown himself ""base and mean,"" not only because he had been drunk, but because he had taken advantage of the young girl's position to abuse her fiancé in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner? Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know the character of the lodgings? He was furnishing a flat... Foo! how despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk? Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the truth had all come out, ""that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse and envious heart""! And would such a dream ever be permissible to him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl—he, the drunken noisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying.

""Of course,"" he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement, ""of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over... and so it's useless even to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!""

And yet as he dressed he examined his attire more carefully than usual. He hadn't another suit—if he had had, perhaps he wouldn't have put it on. ""I would have made a point of not putting it on."" But in any case he could not remain a cynic and a dirty sloven; he had no right to offend the feelings of others, especially when they were in need of his assistance and asking him to see them. He brushed his clothes carefully. His linen was always decent; in that respect he was especially clean.

He washed that morning scrupulously—he got some soap from Nastasya—he washed his hair, his neck and especially his hands. When it came to the question whether to shave his stubbly chin or not (Praskovya Pavlovna had capital razors that had been left by her late husband), the question was angrily answered in the negative. ""Let it stay as it is! What if they think that I shaved on purpose to...? They certainly would think so! Not on any account!""

""And... the worst of it was he was so coarse, so dirty, he had the manners of a pothouse; and... and even admitting that he knew he had some of the essentials of a gentleman... what was there in that to be proud of? Everyone ought to be a gentleman and more than that... and all the same (he remembered) he, too, had done little things... not exactly dishonest, and yet.... And what thoughts he sometimes had; hm... and to set all that beside Avdotya Romanovna! Confound it! So be it! Well, he'd make a point then of being dirty, greasy, pothouse in his manners and he wouldn't care! He'd be worse!""

He was engaged in such monologues when Zossimov, who had spent the night in Praskovya Pavlovna's parlour, came in.

He was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first. Razumihin informed him that Raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse. Zossimov gave orders that they shouldn't wake him and promised to see him again about eleven.

""If he is still at home,"" he added. ""Damn it all! If one can't control one's patients, how is one to cure them? Do you know whether he will go to them, or whether they are coming here?""

""They are coming, I think,"" said Razumihin, understanding the object of the question, ""and they will discuss their family affairs, no doubt. I'll be off. You, as the doctor, have more right to be here than I.""

""But I am not a father confessor; I shall come and go away; I've plenty to do besides looking after them.""
""One thing worries me,"" interposed Razumihin, frowning. ""On the way home I talked a lot of drunken nonsense to him... all sorts of things... and amongst them that you were afraid that he... might become insane.""

""You told the ladies so, too.""

""I know it was stupid! You may beat me if you like! Did you think so seriously?""

""That's nonsense, I tell you, how could I think it seriously? You, yourself, described him as a monomaniac when you fetched me to him... and we added fuel to the fire yesterday, you did, that is, with your story about the painter; it was a nice conversation, when he was, perhaps, mad on that very point! If only I'd known what happened then at the police station and that some wretch... had insulted him with this suspicion! Hm... I would not have allowed that conversation yesterday. These monomaniacs will make a mountain out of a mole-hill... and see their fancies as solid realities.... As far as I remember, it was Zametov's story that cleared up half the mystery, to my mind. Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn't endure the jokes he made every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm... he shouldn't have told all that last night. He is an awful chatterbox!""
""But whom did he tell it to? You and me?""

""And Porfiry.""

""What does that matter?""

""And, by the way, have you any influence on them, his mother and sister? Tell them to be more careful with him to-day....""

""They'll get on all right!"" Razumihin answered reluctantly.

""Why is he so set against this Luzhin? A man with money and she doesn't seem to dislike him... and they haven't a farthing, I suppose? eh?""

""But what business is it of yours?"" Razumihin cried with annoyance. ""How can I tell whether they've a farthing? Ask them yourself and perhaps you'll find out....""

""Foo! what an ass you are sometimes! Last night's wine has not gone off yet.... Good-bye; thank your Praskovya Pavlovna from me for my night's lodging. She locked herself in, made no reply to my bonjour through the door; she was up at seven o'clock, the samovar was taken into her from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....""

At nine o'clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev's house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They had risen at seven o'clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.

Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked, Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because ""she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand."" Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna's questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.
He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov's life, concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted, however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.

""Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don't know your name!"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.
""Dmitri Prokofitch.""

""I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can, what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is he now? In a word, I should like...""

""Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?"" observed Dounia.

""Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this, Dmitri Prokofitch!""

""Naturally,"" answered Razumihin. ""I have no mother, but my uncle comes every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years' separation means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of late—and perhaps for a long time before—he has been suspicious and fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly callous; it's as though he were alternating between two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing nothing. He doesn't jeer at things, not because he hasn't the wit, but as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles. He never listens to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him.""

""God grant it may,"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by Razumihin's account of her Rodya.

And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last. He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question, without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very trying for a man who already felt diffident.

""You've told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother's character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you were too uncritically devoted to him,"" observed Avdotya Romanovna with a smile. ""I think you are right that he needs a woman's care,"" she added thoughtfully.

""I didn't say so; but I daresay you are right, only...""

""What?""

""He loves no one and perhaps he never will,"" Razumihin declared decisively.

""You mean he is not capable of love?""
""Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!"" he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya Romanovna couldn't help laughing when she looked at him.

""You may both be mistaken about Rodya,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked, slightly piqued. ""I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia. What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have supposed may be mistaken, but you can't imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that girl—what was her name—his landlady's daughter?""

""Did you hear about that affair?"" asked Avdotya Romanovna.

""Do you suppose——"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. ""Do you suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn't that he doesn't love us!""

""He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,"" Razumihin answered cautiously. ""But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself, though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was rather strange.""

""And what did you hear?"" both the ladies asked at once.

""Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which only failed to take place through the girl's death, was not at all to Praskovya Pavlovna's liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have had some good qualities or it's quite inexplicable.... She had no money either and he wouldn't have considered her money.... But it's always difficult to judge in such matters.""

""I am sure she was a good girl,"" Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.

""God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don't know which of them would have caused most misery to the other—he to her or she to him,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to the latter's annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.

""He had planned it before his illness,"" he added.

""I think so, too,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air. But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch. Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.

""So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna could not resist asking.

""I can have no other opinion of your daughter's future husband,"" Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, ""and I don't say it simply from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and... mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this morning I am ashamed of it.""

He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began to speak of Luzhin.

Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.

""You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,"" she began. ""I'll be perfectly open with Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?""

""Of course, mother,"" said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.

""This is what it is,"" she began in haste, as though the permission to speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. ""Very early this morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him. You'd better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya's character better than anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell you, made her decision at once, but I still don't feel sure how to act and I... I've been waiting for your opinion.""

Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read as follows:

""Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings not later than to-morrow evening at eight o'clock precisely, and herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview—as he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation, that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage of

""Your humble servant,

""P. LUZHIN.""

""What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?"" began Pulcheria Alexandrovna, almost weeping. ""How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will happen then?""

""Act on Avdotya Romanovna's decision,"" Razumihin answered calmly at once.

""Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn't explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that it would be best, but that it's absolutely necessary that Rodya should make a point of being here at eight o'clock and that they must meet.... I didn't want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so irritable.... Besides I don't understand about that drunkard who died and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the money... which...""

""Which cost you such sacrifice, mother,"" put in Avdotya Romanovna.

""He was not himself yesterday,"" Razumihin said thoughtfully, ""if you only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn't understand a word.... But last night, I myself...""

""The best thing, mother, will be for us to go to him ourselves and there I assure you we shall see at once what's to be done. Besides, it's getting late—good heavens, it's past ten,"" she cried looking at a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her dress. ""A present from her fiancé,"" thought Razumihin.

""We must start, Dounia, we must start,"" her mother cried in a flutter. ""He will be thinking we are still angry after yesterday, from our coming so late. Merciful heavens!""

While she said this she was hurriedly putting on her hat and mantle; Dounia, too, put on her things. Her gloves, as Razumihin noticed, were not merely shabby but had holes in them, and yet this evident poverty gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. ""The queen who mended her stockings in prison,"" he thought, ""must have looked then every inch a queen and even more a queen than at sumptuous banquets and levées.""

""My God!"" exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ""little did I think that I should ever fear seeing my son, my darling, darling Rodya! I am afraid, Dmitri Prokofitch,"" she added, glancing at him timidly.

""Don't be afraid, mother,"" said Dounia, kissing her, ""better have faith in him.""

""Oh, dear, I have faith in him, but I haven't slept all night,"" exclaimed the poor woman.

They came out into the street.

""Do you know, Dounia, when I dozed a little this morning I dreamed of Marfa Petrovna... she was all in white... she came up to me, took my hand, and shook her head at me, but so sternly as though she were blaming me.... Is that a good omen? Oh, dear me! You don't know, Dmitri Prokofitch, that Marfa Petrovna's dead!""

""No, I didn't know; who is Marfa Petrovna?""

""She died suddenly; and only fancy...""

""Afterwards, mamma,"" put in Dounia. ""He doesn't know who Marfa Petrovna is.""

""Ah, you don't know? And I was thinking that you knew all about us. Forgive me, Dmitri Prokofitch, I don't know what I am thinking about these last few days. I look upon you really as a providence for us, and so I took it for granted that you knew all about us. I look on you as a relation.... Don't be angry with me for saying so. Dear me, what's the matter with your right hand? Have you knocked it?""

""Yes, I bruised it,"" muttered Razumihin overjoyed.

""I sometimes speak too much from the heart, so that Dounia finds fault with me.... But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen, you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.""

""Don't question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don't ask him too much about his health; he doesn't like that.""

""Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the stairs.... What an awful staircase!""

""Mother, you are quite pale, don't distress yourself, darling,"" said Dounia caressing her, then with flashing eyes she added: ""He ought to be happy at seeing you, and you are tormenting yourself so.""

""Wait, I'll peep in and see whether he has waked up.""

The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landlady's door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within. When their eyes met, the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that Pulcheria Alexandrovna almost cried out.",misc

We in times where men shuns get mentions
I ain't made for child shit, they look like Wet Ones

4172,"Why are some people extraordinarily selfish, manipulative, and unkind? David Robson asks the scientist delving into the darkest sides of the human mind.

If you had the opportunity to feed harmless bugs into a coffee grinder, would you enjoy the experience? Even if the bugs had names, and you could hear their shells painfully crunching? And would you take a perverse pleasure from blasting an innocent bystander with an excruciating noise?

These are just some of the tests that Delroy Paulhus uses to understand the “dark personalities” around us. Essentially, he wants to answer a question we all may have asked: why do some people take pleasure in cruelty? Not just psychopaths and murderers – but school bullies, internet trolls and even apparently upstanding members of society such as politicians and policemen.

It is easy, he says, to make quick and simplistic assumptions about these people. “We have a tendency to use the halo or devil framing of individuals we meet – we want to simplify our world into good or bad people,” says Paulhus, who is based at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But while Paulhus doesn’t excuse cruelty, his approach has been more detached, like a zoologist studying poisonous insects – allowing him to build a “taxonomy”, as he calls it, of the different flavours of everyday evil.

Self-regard

Paulhus’s interest began with narcissists – the incredibly selfish and vain, who may lash out to protect their own sense of self-worth.  Then, a little more than a decade ago, his grad student Kevin Williams suggested that they explore whether these self-absorbed tendencies are linked to two other unpleasant characteristics – Machiavellianism (the coolly manipulative) and psychopathy (callous insensitivity and immunity to the feelings of others). Together, they found that the three traits were largely independent, though they sometimes coincide, forming a “Dark Triad” – a triple whammy of nastiness.

It is surprising how candid his participants can often be. His questionnaires typically ask the subjects to agree with statements such as “I like picking on weaker people” or “It’s wise not to tell me your secrets”. You would imagine those traits would be too shameful to admit – but, at least in the laboratory, people open up, and their answers do seem to correlate with real-life bullying, both in adolescence and adulthood. They are also more likely to be unfaithful to their spouses (particularly those with Machiavellian and psychopathic tendencies) and to cheat on tests.

Even so, since Paulhus tends to focus on everyday evil rather than criminal or psychiatric cases, the traits are by no means apparent on the first meeting. “They are managing in everyday society, so they have enough control not to get themselves into trouble. But it catches your attention here or there.” People who score particularly high on narcissism, for instance, quickly display their tendency to “over-claim” – one of the strategies that helps them boost their own egos. In some experiments, Paulhus presented them with a made up subject and they quickly confabulated to try to appear like they knew it all – only to get angry when he challenged them about it. “It strikes you that yes, this fits into a package that allows them to live with a distorted positive view of themselves.”

Born nasty

Once Paulhus had begun to open a window on these dark minds, others soon wanted to delve in to answer some basic questions about the human condition. Are people born nasty, for instance? Studies comparing identical and non-identical twins suggest a relatively large genetic component for both narcissism and psychopathy, though Machiavellianism seems to be more due to the environment – you may learn to manipulate from others. Whatever we’ve inherited cannot take away our personal responsibility, though. “I don’t think anyone is born with psychopathy genes and then nothing can be done about it,” says Minna Lyons at the University of Liverpool.

You only need to look at the anti-heroes of popular culture – James Bond, Don Draper or Jordan Belfort in the Wolf of Wall Street – to realise that dark personalities have sex appeal, a finding supported by more scientific studies. Further clues to the benefits might come from another basic human characteristic – whether you are a morning or evening person. Lyons and her student, Amy Jones found that “night owls” – people who stay up late but can’t get up in the morning – tend to score higher on a range of dark triad traits. They are often risk-takers – one of the characteristics of psychopathy; they are more manipulative – a Machiavellian trait – and as narcissists, they tend to be exploitative of other people. That might make sense if you consider our evolution: perhaps dark personalities have more chance to steal, manipulate, and have illicit sexual liaisons late while everyone else is sleeping, so they evolved to be creatures of the night.
Whatever the truth of that theory, Paulhus agrees there will always be niches for these people to exploit. “Human society is so complex that there are different ways of enhancing your reproductive success – some involve being nice and some being nasty,” he says.

Dark corners

Recently, he has started probing even further into the darkest shadows of the psyche.  “We were pushing the envelope, asking more extreme questions,” he says – when he found that some people will also readily admit to inflicting pain on others for no other reason than their own pleasure. Crucially, these tendencies are not simply a reflection of the narcissism, psychopathy or Machiavellianism, but seem to form their own sub-type – “everyday sadism”. For this reason, Paulhus now calls it a “dark tetrad”.

The “bug crushing machine” offered the perfect way for Paulhus and colleagues to test whether that reflected real life behaviour. Unknown to the participants, the coffee grinder had been adapted to give insects an escape route – but the machine still produced a devastating crushing sound to mimic their shells hitting the cogs. Some were so squeamish they refused to take part, while others took active enjoyment in the task. “They would be willing not just to do something nasty to bugs but to ask for more,” he says, “while others thought it was so gross they didn’t even want to be in the same room.” Crucially, those individuals also scored very highly on his test for everyday sadism.

Arguably, a rational human being shouldn’t care too much about bugs’ feelings. But the team then set up a computer game that would allow the participants to “punish” a competitor with a loud noise through their headphones. This wasn’t compulsory; in fact, the volunteers had to perform a tedious verbal task to earn the right to punish their competitor – but, to Paulhus’s surprise, the everyday sadists were more than happy to take the trouble. “There wasn’t just willingness to do it but a motivation to enjoy, to put in some extra effort to have the opportunity to hurt other individuals.” Importantly, there was no provocation or personal gain to be had from their cruelty – the people were doing it for pure pleasure.

Troll tracking

He thinks this is directly relevant to internet trolls. “They appear to be the internet version of everyday sadists because they spend time searching for people to hurt.” Sure enough, an anonymous survey of trollish commentators found that they scored highly on dark tetrad traits, but particularly the everyday sadism component – and enjoyment was their prime motivation. Indeed, the bug-crushing experiment suggested that everyday sadists may have more muted emotional responses to all kinds of pleasurable activities – so perhaps their random acts of cruelty are attempts to break through the emotional numbness.

More immediately, his discoveries have attracted the attention of police and military agencies, who want to collaborate with Paulhus to see if his insights might explain why some people abuse their positions.  “The concern is that these people might deliberately select jobs where you are given the mandate to hurt individuals,” he says. If so, further work might suggest ways to screen out the dark personalities at recruitment.

He’s also excited about new work on “moral Machiavellianism” and “communal narcissists” – people who perhaps have dark traits but use them for good (as they see it). In some situations, ruthlessness may be necessary. “To be prime minister, you can’t be namby pamby – you need to cut corners and hurt people, and even be nasty to achieve your moral causes,” he says. After all, the dark personalities often have the impulse and the confidence to get things done –even Mother Theresa apparently had a steely side, he says. “You’re not going to help society by sitting at home being nice.”

All of which underlines the false dichotomy of good and evil that Paulhus has been keen to probe. In a sense, that is a personal as much as a professional question. He admits to seeing a dark streak in his own behaviour: for example, he enjoys watching violent, painful sports like Mixed Martial Arts. “It didn’t take long to see I would stand above average on these dark traits,” he says. “But given my abiding curiosity as a scientist and my enjoyment of investigating such things – I thought that perhaps I was in a good position to take a closer look at the dark side.”",misc

An everlasting vision of the ever-changing view
A wondrous woven magic in bits of blue and gold
A tapestry to feel and see, impossible to hold
Once, amid the soft, silver sadness in the sky
There came a man of fortune, a drifter passing by
He wore a torn and tattered cloth around his leathered hide
And a coat of many colors, yellow, green on either side
He moved with some uncertainty, as if we didn't know
Just what he was there for, or where he ought to go
Once he reached for something golden, hanging from a tree
And his hand came down empty
Soon within my tapestry, along the rutted road
He sat down on a river rock and turned into a toad
It seemed that he had fallen into someone's wicked spell
And I wept to see him suffer, though I didn't know him well
As I watched in sorrow, there suddenly appeared
A figure, gray and ghostly, beneath a flowing beard
In times of deepest darkness, I've seen him dressed in black
Now my tapestry's unraveling; he's come to take me back
He's come to take me back",pop

(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you

[Verse 1]
My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..

Cut the dread locked fur
From the cat’s neck
Without drawing blood
You left for work
With a dozen dead
Snakes in your hand
While I searched for a
Peanut butter cookie
Or one with raisins and oats

I’ve been sleeping till two
I frequent the sleaziest chat-rooms
In the middle of the night
And eat cold pizza
With my pants unbuttoned
Waiting for your screen name
To appear, knowing all the while
That you are fast asleep

And there it is - the moon
The mysterious moon
That shines so bright and clear
Like a crystal ball at night
With great strength and unholiness
As death itself
And there it is - the moon
The mesmerising moon
To behold and to witness the rise of the horned one below
When he spreads his shadow down on the burning ground
And as he spreads his wings so majestic across the skies and fly away
... to divide and conquer
Diabolical legions of demons, thousand legions of demons
-an army of darkness, malice, hate and total destruction
Shoulder to shoulder and with swords in their hands
To divide and conquer they march so proud
The sun has died-never to rise again, just like jesus christ
All priests will die their churches burn
Their lambs drains from all blood
-a war so fucking unholy
The hellfire has risen high-to divide and conquer
The horned one stands proud-to divide and conquer
All demons raise their swords-to divide and conquer
Shoulder to shoulder they march-to divide and conquer
Thunder and lightning cold winds and rain
It all appeared when the battle began
The dying priests are crying and their tears falls to the ground
As the legions are marching forward
No mercy is shown no mercy is given
They will reap this land and harvest all the souls
They bear malice against all that is holy, glorified and just
Behold the destruction of all beauty in mankind
Divide et impera
Omnia quae exsistimant nostra sunt
Satanus protectus il aegonis viene con il crio

The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
The horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
All demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer
Shoulder to shoulder they march - to divide and conquer
Slay molest and destroy is their only commands
Which they obey with pleasure
Their master stands so pleased and watch this devastating battle
He smiles and scream in great rejoice
As all priests and nuns are slayed
All christ believers can now behold their creation and vision fade away
Finally the kingdom of hell with its supreme lord can rule this world
He has risen high-to divide and conquer!
Dogs of christ-you christian whores
The final battle of all souls is here
Down on your knees and pray (though your prayers won't help you)
Cause it's time for you to die
Unleash the beast within-the dark soul that breeds in man
Set your demons free, behold their strength and give up your soul
Thou shalt not be saved. thou shalt be enslaved
You christian whore!
Damnation awaits
You christian whore!!!
And there it is the moon - the magical moon
That witnessed the rise of the horned one below
Which ended with the destruction of all beauty in mankind
The kingdom of hell: victorious
The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
The horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
All demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer
Shoulder to shoulder they march - to divide and conquer
Slay molest and destroy are their only commands
Which they obey with pleasure
Their master stands so pleased and watch this devastating battle
He smiles and scream in great rejoice
As all priests and nuns are slayed
All christ believers can now behold their creation and vision fade away
Finally the kingdom of hell with its supreme lord can rule this world
He has risen high-to divide and conquer!
The hellfire has risen high - to divide and conquer
The horned one stands proud - to divide and conquer
All demons raise their swords - to divide and conquer

5808,"[Verse 1]
I gave up long ago on the hope I might be near
To that something I thought I need
To that place I had to find
It was only after then that the truth became so clear
A chase I din't want
A place I didn't need
A disembodied lie

[Chorus]
Don't save a place for me
I'm not going where you've been
It might have taken a little while
But I found the path within
I won't end up where you are
It took some time to see
That I've got something more
So don't save a place for me
No, don't save a placе for me

[Verse 2]
I see the questions now, so much clеarer than before
Instead of just the answers everyone thinks they understand
And I promise I won't be back, not for anything, nothing more
It's all been left behind and that is where it dies
It won't hinder me again
[Chorus]
Don't save a place for me
I'm not going where you've been
It might have taken a little while
But I found the path within
I won't end up where you are
It took some time to see
That I've got something more
So don't save a place for me
No, don't save a place for me

In the days that I went missing, when I rolled over on my life
What’s the word for when you realize too late, you were the apple of my eye?

Heart filled with second-guessing, I measured my insides
Glad-handed some direction, and found out I forgot I could fly

At the risk of contradicting, I was sure you walked right by
As sure that I’d get by on sunshine years, and a love so divine

With the grace of every blessing, will I realize in time?
That my every favourite weakness, has kept me drunk and blind

From the end to the beginning, old ghosts tend to survive
But I’m fighting my traditions, patching holes with lies

Was there always something missing in the middle of my smile?
Imagine my surprise when we went down without a fight

My oh my what a cold, cold world
But if you were here with me tonight
Nerves of steel, but still impressionable
From here I can see all of the stars
If I had had the chance to say goodbye
If I knew then what I know now
You said you’re sure this all means something
But all my bright ideas have led to nothing",rock

Why does your dumb ass think at lock down
Don't apply to you at all?

Nothing

I would flutter all around him

Where everyone is asleep
The words “I shall fight fair”
Were ever shunned by sheeps
I got a thirst for revenge
And I’ll enjoy every sip

Meanwhile the darkness seeps

I’m the plague of your city
Playing my CD
Death looks upon us
While you pray for pity

But soon you’ll be gone
And goddamn army too
You’ve heard of number 1?
Well I’m goddamn number 2

The Afro emperor
Stone cold murderer
My conscience just called
Would you hold
As I murder her ?
Forget about a flow
It’s fire that I spit
My katana got the swing
See heads bounce from the pit

Ever since father died
Man that I swear that I flee the light
‘was not born to kill
I was thrown down into the fight

So don’t cross my black stare
Don’t touch my black hair
I’ll slap your ass right there
And leave you with back tear

Straight from the dread land
Where the dead stand
For the head band
We steal, kill, feel the demons climax
When the blades bend

Facing the hurt
Braced by its quirt
Embracing our fate
When left face in the dirt
Yo I slayed with the mask off
No way I will backoff
‘Til I get my prey
Everyday I will blastoff !

Tied in the sorrow
Tired of tomorrow
I try to live fast
‘Cause no time can be borrow !

Your face comes to my mind
Like waves come to the shore
‘Know who I am

I don’t think I’ll ever be free

‘Cause mother [jsh jsh] are booming !

And they’re coming for your throat
Just thought, you should note
We are on the same boat, struggling to stay afloat

But this ship’s ever sinking
What were you thinking ?
I’ll turn on your ass
By the time you are done blinking !

It’s the endless hate
See us lurking around
Like we are helpless bait
In a reckless bet
Between heaven and hell
Bathed in their spell
Trapped by the cells
Of the faiths that we dwell

And that is our battle !
Not born to settle
We’re writing our story
Like that is riddle

Be cursed or be blessed
But never feel stressed
If life is a school
I guess loss is a test",rap

This is called ""Ogre Battle""

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

Now once upon a time, an old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone and the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies, to find a new destination
That is the sign
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry, swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
Palm of a hand, incredible size
Great big eye, has a focus in your direction
And the battle is won
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!
Ooh, watch out

[Bridge]
The ogre-men are still inside
Two-way mirror mountain
You gotta stand clear and out of sight
You can't see in, but you can't see out
""So keep a good lookout!""
The ogre-men are coming up
Two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind and they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Ogre-men are going home
And then the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

Making moves daily shaping the future like Egyptians
What we talk about is unique, writing what you can't miss
We never fall off I never put myself above it
Yes I fucking love it I was seduced right away
Catch me locked in my room still writing for days
And I ain't chasing no fame, want respect for my peers

Got a good girl, tryna get her diploma
Good head, that shit put me in a coma

Niggas swearin' they be having good pressure
Bitches all wanna take it different measures
But I ain’t changing, weather
Shawdy wanna fuck but it’s only for the pleasure but it's whatever

I'm a cancer
In a whip getting followed by some dancers
They be asking but they never get the answer
And I be shitting on niggas no pamper

And my niggas on alert no Amber
So don't play or you're gonna meet the hammer
Boy I heard what you said to the slammer
'bout to get caught lacking on camera

But I hope that you'll find what your're searching for
But you can't come and go like you did before
No need to return
I closed my heart's door

As the pages unfold your memory will creep
Like water that roll for years in one place
Your love left a mark time can't erase

Its features are changing every flower

It is handing out a line
""Since you're only borrowing my time
I'll be following behind
Just in case you change your mind
And when evening comes I'll rob you of your sunshine""

With the dew drops in your eyes
Listening to the morning sighs
And the lonesome heart cries
Of the white gull as he flies
I can't forget the things I don't wish to remember

To improve, and build the future up from the blues

It's time we learn from mistakes and open up a new page
Our Mother Earth is in pain, at what cost, at what gain
We gotta see each other equally and severe this chain, uh
So don't sit, with your head in the clouds
Use your voice, raise it up, sing this shit sing it loud
A wise man once said, what goes around comes around
So be the change that you wanna see and make yourself proud

At the top of Undercliffe Road
You and me and your motorbike
In the ice and drifting snow
3 a.m. and empty, the city ours alone
And laughing through the trails of frozen breathing

I swore to you that I could fly
If you only let me go
Holding on as we leant over
The edge of Baildon Moor
And far beneath the shadowed lands
The rocks and shapeless dark
And all that space for us to fall in
And all I could feel was myself fallingâ€¦

Neon weekends and madhouse nights
And so much time to taste
We built monuments to the things we loved
Then laid each one to waste
All in suicidal vengeance
Screaming 'justice justice now'
As across the burning bridges we thundered
Now all the rooms at the Inn are taken
By those wiser than us
We're still driving for the sunset, love
And then on into the dusk
Because all the dreams were meaningless
And impossible to touch
But we're still crazed enough to drive for ever
I swear that I can stay awake forever",pop

We were tight right from the start
It wasn't long before you came on strong
Trying hard to win my heart (Try to win it)
I played hard to get

You were thoughtful
Careful not to hurt the relationship

What happened to those days
When you used to be compassionate (Compassionate)

So attentive; a gentleman

When our love was something new
Back when romance was important
Not just another thing to do (Another thing to do)

Thought I'd never come back down
Now it seems that you and me have lost our solid ground

After time, I realized I seem to give more than I get
(More than I get)
Funny how things seem to change after a few years commitment
Used to talk for hours on end of our dreams while we lay in bed

Now you roll over and snore instead

8406,"And there, in that ripe Summer-night, once more
A wintry coolness through the open door
And window seemed to touch each glowing face
Refreshingly; and, for a fleeting space,
The quickened fancy, through the fragrant air,
Saw snowflakes whirling where the roseleaves were,
And sounds of veriest jingling bells again
Were heard in tinkling spoons and glasses then.

Thus Uncle Mart's old poem sounded young
And crisp and fresh and clear as when first sung,
Away back in the wakening of Spring
When his rhyme and the robin, chorusing,
Rumored, in duo-fanfare, of the soon
Invading johnny-jump-ups, with platoon
On platoon of sweet-williams, marshaled fine
To bloomed blarings of the trumpet-vine.

The poet turned to whisperingly confer
A moment with ""The Noted Traveler.""
Then left the room, tripped up the stairs, and then
An instant later reappeared again,
Bearing a little, lacquered box, or chest,
Which, as all marked with curious interest,
He gave to the old Traveler, who in
One hand upheld it, pulling back his thin
Black lustre coat-sleeves, saying he had sent
Up for his ""Magic Box,"" and that he meant
To test it there--especially to show
_The Children_. ""It is _empty now_, you know.""--
He humped it with his knuckles, so they heard
The hollow sound--""But lest it be inferred
It is not _really_ empty, I will ask
_Little Jack Janitor_, whose pleasant task
It is to keep it ship-shape.""
Then he tried
And rapped the little drawer in the side,
And called out sharply ""Are you in there, Jack?""
And then a little, squeaky voice came back,--
""_Of course I'm in here--ain't you got the key
Turned on me!_""

Then the Traveler leisurely
Felt through his pockets, and at last took out
The smallest key they ever heard about!--
It,wasn't any longer than a pin:
And this at last he managed to fit in
The little keyhole, turned it, and then cried,
""Is everything swept out clean there inside?""
""_Open the drawer and see!--Don't talk to much;
Or else_,"" the little voice squeaked, ""_talk in Dutch--
You age me, asking questions!_""

Then the man
Looked hurt, so that the little folks began
To feel so sorry for him, he put down
His face against the box and had to frown.--
""Come, sir!"" he called,--""no impudence to _me!_--
You've swept out clean?""

""_Open the drawer and see!_""
And so he drew the drawer out: Nothing there,
But just the empty drawer, stark and bare.
He shoved it back again, with a shark click.--
""_Ouch!_"" yelled the little voice--""_un-snap it--quick!--
You've got my nose pinched in the crack!_""

And then
The frightened man drew out the drawer again,
The little voice exclaiming, ""_Jeemi-nee!--
Say what you want, but please don't murder me!_""

""Well, then,"" the man said, as he closed the drawer
With care, ""I want some cotton-batting for
My supper! Have you got it?""

And inside,
All muffled like, the little voice replied,
""_Open the drawer and see!_""

And, sure enough,
He drew it out, filled with the cotton stuff.
He then asked for a candle to be brought
And held for him: and tuft by tuft he caught
And lit the cotton, and, while blazing, took
It in his mouth and ate it, with a look
Of purest satisfaction.

""Now,"" said he,
""I've eaten the drawer empty, let me see
What this is in my mouth:"" And with both hands
He began drawing from his lips long strands
Of narrow silken ribbons, every hue
And tint;--and crisp they were and bright and new
As if just purchased at some Fancy-Store.
""And now, Bub, bring your cap,"" he said, ""before
Something might happen!"" And he stuffed the cap
Full of the ribbons. ""_There_, my little chap,
Hold _tight_ to them,"" he said, ""and take them to
The ladies there, for they know what to do
With all such rainbow finery!""
He smiled
Half sadly, as it seemed, to see the child
Open his cap first to his mother..... There
Was not a ribbon in it anywhere!
""_Jack Janitor!_"" the man said sternly through
The Magic Box--""Jack Janitor, did _you_
Conceal those ribbons anywhere?""

""_Well, yes,_""
The little voice piped--""_but you'd never guess
The place I hid 'em if you'd guess a year!_""

""Well, won't you _tell_ me?""

""_Not until you clear
Your mean old conscience_"" said the voice, ""_and make
Me first do something for the Children's sake._""

""Well, then, fill up the drawer,"" the Traveler said,
""With whitest white on earth and reddest red!--
Your terms accepted--Are you satisfied?""

""_Open the drawer and see!_"" the voice replied.

""_Why, bless my soul!_""--the man said, as he drew
The contents of the drawer into view--
""It's level-full of _candy!_--Pass it 'round--
Jack Janitor shan't steal _that_, I'll be bound!""--
He raised and crunched a stick of it and smacked
His lips.--""Yes, that _is_ candy, for a fact!--
And it's all _yours!_""

And how the children there
Lit into it!--O never anywhere
Was such a feast of sweetness!

""And now, then,""
The man said, as the empty drawer again
Slid to its place, he bending over it,--
""Now, then, Jack Janitor, before we quit
Our entertainment for the evening, tell
Us where you hid the ribbons--can't you?""

""_Well,_""
The squeaky little voice drawled sleepily--
""_Under your old hat, maybe.--Look and see!_""

All carefully the man took off his hat:
But there was not a ribbon under that.--
He shook his heavy hair, and all in vain
The old white hat--then put it on again:
""Now, tell me, _honest_, Jack, where _did_ you hide
The ribbons?""

""_Under your hat_"" the voice replied.--
""_Mind! I said 'under' and not 'in' it.--Won't
You ever take the hint on earth?--or don't
You want to show folks where the ribbons at?--
Law! but I'm sleepy!--Under--unner your hat!_""

Again the old man carefully took off
The empty hat, with an embarrassed cough,
Saying, all gravely to the children: ""You
Must promise not to _laugh_--you'll all _want_ to--
When you see where Jack Janitor has dared
To hide those ribbons--when he might have spared
My feelings.--But no matter!--Know the worst--
Here are the ribbons, as I feared at first.""--
And, quick as snap of thumb and finger, there
The old man's head had not a sign of hair,
And in his lap a wig of iron-gray
Lay, stuffed with all that glittering array
Of ribbons ... ""Take 'em to the ladies--Yes.
Good-night to everybody, and God bless
The Children.""

In a whisper no one missed
The Hired Man yawned: ""He's a vantrilloquist""

*      *      *      *      *

So gloried all the night Each trundle-bed
And pallet was enchanted--each child-head
Was packed with happy dreams. And long before
The dawn's first far-off rooster crowed, the snore
Of Uncle Mart was stilled, as round him pressed
The bare arms of the wakeful little guest
That he had carried home with him....

""I think,""
An awed voice said--""(No: I don't want a _dwink_.--
Lay still.)--I think 'The Noted Traveler' he
'S the inscrutibul-est man I ever see!""",misc

A lesson in lost and shattered men

Welcome to the story of their solemn fears
Spare all the innocence you can

Here in this world of lost misery
A bit of faith isn't that what you said

Sometimes they face endless futility
All of them have lived on the edge

Here we stand...It's a long way down
Lives in hand...Can you see the end
Ours to take...Find a reason
Ours to waste...Before you make the call

All Alone...It's a long way home
Free to go...Are you really free?
Revenge is sweet...Sickeningly so
Best served cold...What are you thinking
Are you saying that all you had means nothing?
If that's your sight now then you will be here forever...

The sting of hatred is all too real to you
A face in time is all you know

A world shut out unable to rescue you
A final plea begging for your soul

As you leave to carry out your final masquerade
It becomes so clear this darkness in your head

A pawn in the game of humanity
Another lost soul crying from the edge

Where is home?...It's a long way down
Where is me?...On the edge of life
Reflections of...I'll take the time
Broken dreams...To help you understand

Lost in time...It's a long way home
No place here...It's the life you lead
May be hope...I'll take the time
I don't care...Forgive yourself

If you're convinced that all in life means nothing
Then I can't help you, you have reached the edge...",pop

You went to mix the song crisis at studio Fendal (yeah)
Me and sonny went to a party that night
My ex was working on my nerves but
Still shit was all right
Cause it was hot mad steaming and bitches were feenin'
I had to take somebody with me at that Saturday
Evening so I ordered a drink and I found my prey
I said hey do you mind she said nah I said okay
But hmm where do you live and how do you f*ck
I thought maybe she got horny with a little bit of luck
She said nah I'm not like that see I'm a model
By the time we got home that bitch was chewing on my milkbottle
Bitch you was slick when it came to my dick
Hey yo Mis (what?) remember this fat bitch I used to stick (aha)
All starstrucked bobbies bucked
She liked it thick
Ate my shit del rio style but she was counterfeit
Hot lips around my collar went in deep like the abyss
What's her name? Danielle cheesy like mozzarella
E- life the fly fella fell in a trap
Upset set up with a friend who went the extra lap
You is gonna bleed claiming my seed claiming my breed
It's gonna be a mess because you thought you could posses
You mindless I'm priceless
Curse the day you run into me god bless
I caught her nibbling on her pinky
Blinking with her spermy eyes
Asking me the time knowing dick was on her mind
She was the type to act shy
So I replied with a smile
Caught her glancing at my frame to see if I was her style
Then with a smile she said:
Ain't you the one that be blowin up spots
Looking like that singing nigga that be playing on the box
Knowing she knew already
Don't get me wrong I ain't the type to give it up
Leaving my reaction like what up
Playing hard to get sweat from my balls
See I got dick for days for all of y'all
Acting like she don't want it
But she kept on responding
Flaunting Jane in my direction now I'm on it
Mrs. Jungle boogie cockteaser sucking blankets
Through my stomach breather
Ya see these hoes I play'em simple no pussy or riddles
I let their cat sizzle and I give'em finger middle
Now play my dick jingle I'm almost busting pimples
I turn big to little genetials cripple
Let go in and out flow then I increase the tempo
Call my gunz (what up kid)
Hey yo let's double Dutch this
Love is misfit different day different mistress
Got to maintain a million names on my hitlist
Still some chicks are tricks try to pass me the itch
But I don't sweat it at six I'm probably banging their sis
Treat her like shit when it's over with she is quickly dismissed
My match was drastic I had fun while it lasted
Well I'm the illest sperm donor had sex with Monica
Monifah they posed two hoes in front of the camera
Maintain the stamina boil your body temperature
Heated the big but I beat it
Hard caliber large start pushing
My ragga push made a touch pussy souffl
Never had a bad day
Proceed when having headaches f*cked rhonda in a red Honda
My dick found his way into the bush like an Anaconda

Back to the Earth, completing cycles
I've discovered that life gives
Back who we are, a new sensation
The end is the start in creation

And tear your attachments like ripping your flesh
'Till there's nothing left
They're both worth the same anyway
You're receiving consiousness
Your physical death is ready to grow new life

Back to the Earth, completing cycles
I've discovered that life gives
Back who we are, a new sensation
The end is the start in creation

On Nineveh's final cry
On Troy's dying knell
And watching the Nazarene die…

Secret queen of a hundred fallen empires
Born out of the shadow of the moon
From beyond the birth of time

Rustling leaves in autumn hues
Her steps imprint the nightfrost hoar

Got in my car and took control
Faced away from neon city and made the wheels roll

There’s a traffic jam in the direction I came from

Jimmy A. LernerWe came into town under cover of night, because we were pretty sure the people here were going to hate us once they really got to know us. In our lives together, which are sweet in the way of rotting things, it is somehow permanently summer

THE MOON rose above the trees, older than time greener than money. You hung your head out the window of our dusty lemon-yellow El Camino and howled, and I turned up the radio, because the sound of your voice was already beginning to get to me. The speakers crackled and the music came through: Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Pretty as a midsummer's morn, they call her dawn. Let the love of God come and get is if it wants us so bad. We know were we are going when all of this is done

SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY that buying a house you've never actually seen close-up is a bad idea, but what does anybody know about our needs, anyhow? For us it was perfect. The peeling paint. The old cellar. The garden in the back. The porch out front. The still air of the living room. The attic. Everywhere entirely unfurnished and doomed to remain largely so, save for our own meager offerings: a cheap sofa, an old mattress, a couple of chairs and some ashtrays. Maybe a table salvaged from some diner gone into bankruptcy, I don't remember. Neither do you. We drank store-brand gin with fresh lime juice out of plastic cups or straight from the bottle and we spread ourselves out face-up on the wooden floors. An aerial view of us might have suggested that we'd been knocked out, but what we were doing was staking our claim. Establishing our territories making good. Not on the vows we'd made but on the ones we'd really meant. You produced a wallet-sized transistor radio out of nowhere and you found a sympathetic station: somebody was playing Howlin' Wolf. Smokestack lightning. O yes, I loved you once. O yes, you loved me more. We entered our new house like a virus entering its host. You following me, me following you. However you like. The windows were high and the walls were thick and sturdy. It was hot as blazes The guts of summer. Always down in the sugar-deep barrel-bottom belly of summer itself. Always. In our shared walk down to the bottom, which bottom we will surely find if only our hearts are brave and our love true enough, we have found that it is somehow invariably and quite permanently summerLeading cases are the stuff of which the common law is made, and no leading case in the common law is better known than that of Regina v. Dudley and Stephens. It was decided in 1884 by a court in the Royal Courts of Justice in London. In it, two profoundly respectable Seamen, Captain Tom Dudley and Mate Edwin Stephens, lately of the yacht Mignonette were sentenced to death for murder of their shipmate, Ordinary Seaman Richard Parker, after a bench of five judges had ruled that one must not kill one's shipmates in order to eat them, however hungry one might be

Stay away – from the sewers
A new breed – for a new age
They bleed – putrid acid from the flesh

Flood from the cesspools
Brought the toxic waste of mankind
No trace of morals
They are deaf and dumb and blind
They feed on the flesh
Of anyone who might oppose
Spread infestation
Every bite is a deadly dose

They try to hide their slimy skin behind a suit and tie
I’ve been running for a long long time and now I’m so tired
Can’t escape no matter where you go, nowhere is safe to stay
Teeth clatter behind my back as I hear them say

Become one of us! (x3)
These days it’s everything I hear
Become one of us! (x3)
I wish that noise would disappear
All known resistance left broken in its wake
We’re losing the war, make no mistake
Flood from the sewers covers everything you love
And there’s no cure, no salvation from above

And we’re all drowning in a steaming pile of shit
Sinking slowly to the bottom of the pit",rock

Stumble into thought, let years pass by
Feel sorry for myself through the clarity of hindsight

The wires of my fear swim through waves in the air
Catch the spurts of a stare that I keep by my side
Spectre of pride, a vindictive stride
A vengeful valor born out of a cryptic mind

I could follow the day like a dark cloud
But your love keeps me a dry land
The company you keep will betray you
Because your devotion sells for nothing
And if the company you keep is just yourself
Than you will sell yourself for nothing
Just to be seen by anyone else
Flesh obscures beauty, like a strange light
Charm and travail, it digs a hole in my mind
Filled with insects and dead day sunsets
God’s love is a drunk love but yours is one to hide

The chiming sound of triumph and pain
Sister of mercy cut her wrists on the summer lawns
And the blood moon ticks like a shotgun shell
Or a copper wish falling down a wishing well
Just to be heard by anyone else

Born alone diatribe, orphaned homeless itemized
Mixed my Five Alive with some cyanide
Crawl back into my hole like Bugs Bunny
Cash stashed in the mattress, I don't make that much money
Just lovely, the smile is a lie
Between four walls, behind a door it's kinda deprived
Pretty faces bump uglies and their sinus on fire
Sign of the times, surprised without a violent demise, I mean
There's always lived people like George Zimmerman
But murder was always murder, now they're hunting your citizens
More like children on the phone with authorities
But life's good with a Bud Light, sunburned on the Florida Keys
Shit keeps me awake at night
The world's electricity harnessed in my room, I pay the piper
I sit at my desk and pour Guinnesses
Give tax dough to a government they'll only build more prisons with
And you're born alone, die a tribe, marginalized

I'm on the fence
All I see is characters, I try to catch the wolves before the woolen hoodie's drawn to blend
I see my breath when I exhale in August and
A cold world till it's gone and yet
I'm on the fence

[Verse 2: Zeebot & *sample*]
I count the loonies in my pocket getting that Acme anvil
Putting in work to earn my worth, I hardly had a handle
On all my vices left a curse, I find it hard to manage
All of the things pulling apart my brain, feeling all dismantled
And when the gears start to break, caught living day by day
Scraping change from the eye in the sky
Cold reminder we're divided, tryna make it on time
We're on fire can't save the design
And it's a first place race to the top
But channel zero cut the wire motivated with 'Bot
It's all survival ask Charles, you either make it or not
It's on time it's on vinyl, just wait for the drop
Stop tripping and roll, it's not a dragon why you chasing control?
It's all smokescreens blazing and dope fiends paying
The price to see freedom, holding these demons
Till the lights start fading we're supposed to keep breathing
""Course you know, this means war""
[Chorus: Sawbuck]
I'm on the fence
All I see is characters, I try to catch the wolves before the woolen hoodie's drawn to blend
I see my breath when I exhale in August and
A cold world till it's gone and yet
I'm on the fence
All I see is characters, I try to catch the wolves before the woolen hoodie's drawn to blend
I see my breath when I exhale in August and
A cold world till it's gone and yet
I'm on the fence

[Verse 3: Bender & *Bugs Bunny sample*]
My paper chase is like Wile E. after the Roadrunner
I'm no hustler, bad with money like the Koch brothers
We all aspire to be couch money gazillionaires
Who break bread with upper crust and ransack their silverware
We don't have no war to fight, it's only TV
We suckle from the pig that ate the wolf, this milk is greasy
See me wallowing waist-high in my feces
Watching the revolution getting filmed against a green screen
My whole species living off a fortune stolen
'Fore you know it karma boomerangs, the veil gets torn wide open
That's why my door is bolted, feeling agoraphobic
Staring out my window while the storm approaches like a swarm of locusts
Course it's hopeless, the banks who make the Earth revolve
Playing a game we could never stand for like Murderball
Vision is 20/20 I can see the future
Got a vision of 2020 I can't see my future 
""Anyone for Russian roulette?""
[Chorus: Sawbuck]
I'm on the fence
All I see is characters, I try to catch the wolves before the woolen hoodie's drawn to blend
I see my breath when I exhale in August and
A cold world till it's gone and yet
I'm on the fence
All I see is characters, I try to catch the wolves before the woolen hoodie's drawn to blend
I see my breath when I exhale in August and
A cold world till it's gone and yet
I'm on the fence

[Verse 1]
You ever have a bad bitch try to kick it with you in your Twitter DMs?
I have—been a statistic and demonstrated against
Wicked minds of the twisted bitches challengin' scrubs
I had a bitch expose me on MediaTakeOut
And after her 15 minutes of fame was up
She hit my phone back apologizin', askin', ""Can we still fuck?""
Bitch, please, miss me—I'm paid as hell
I got the game locked—arcades in jail
I wish my uncle wouldn't have died, he woulda loved to see this
Find you a nigga who do molly with a buzz and beat it
I'm 'bout to walk up in this restaurant, like the upper echelon
Is you comin'? Guess you not—bitch, I'll call you
I find it hi-larious when bad-ass bitches try to get your attention
Be lookin' like fish out of water, it be for no (no) reason
A chick'll drop a pencil and go, ""Oh, (oh) Jesus""
Just to bend down to get this shit to show (show) cleavage
Haha, why can't y'all just ask a nigga for his number like we do y'all?
I'll tell you, women don't know how to flirt
And the ones that's bad, they don't even gotta work
That's real shit
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" + sample]
I see it all the time, anytime I shine
I'm just acknowledgin', but I'm not tryna play y'all
This is it (what?) Bad bitches can't flirt good for shit
This is it (what?) They used to me comin' out the dick
Real quick (what?) like this is it, (what?)
This is it (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo!
Women don't know how to flirt (""That's right"")

[Interlude: 2 Chainz]
You know how I come in
Talk to 'em, Chainz!

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay, came up the street like a ladder—Aladdin
I bust through the hole like McFadden on Madden
A matter of fact, that's a after effect
If the crime don't fit, then I'm takin' it back
Now, fuckin' on this bitch who wear eye contacts
And I pulled a bitch off of iContact
And I had the racks since she had a nice rack
Met her at Bergdorf, right by the nice racks
She said, ""Should I get a shirt to match with the hat?
Or should I get the shoes that match with the slacks?""
Yeah, said it's for her man, ain't gotta be, they comin'
Had a lil' Uzi on me—DJ Drama
Never trust a bitch, and, yeah—I never will
Okay, sometimes—if she got sex appeal
I meant to say—I like to have sex and take some pills
I meant to say—I like to relax and make a mill'
I meant to say—I like to relax and make a meal
I mean, they both the same thing, but I ain't talkin' grill
I ain't talkin' dinner, I ain't talkin' supper, this the bloodsucker
Met the bitch at FuddRucker off Amityville
She had a man on the real, he had his hand on the steel
Fucked in the Camry still, I shoulda passed on the real
Would have assist with her ass, I got more dimes than a pass
And if I knew your dude was crazy, I wouldn't have let me smash
[Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"" + sample]
I see it all the time, anytime I shine
I'm just acknowledgin', but I'm not tryna play y'all
This is it (what?) Bad bitches can't flirt good for shit
This is it (what?) They used to me comin' out the dick
Real quick (what?) like this is it, (what?)
This is it (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo!
Women don't know how to flirt (""That's right"")

Can there be more in this world than the joy of just watching you sleep?
I don't know just what to feel
Won't someone tell me my love's real?

Are we etched in stone or just scratched in the sand
Waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land?
Will the sun shine all sweetness and light
Burn us to a cinder, our third stone satellite?

Striding through the clouds, on my ribbon in the sky

Long way down

She's all that ever mattered, and all that ever will
My cup, it runneth over, I'll never get my fill
The boats in the harbour slip from their chains
Head for new horizons, let's do the same

Follow me far since the beginning
Here not because I have money and women
Still I'm hating on em if they act like we still pendin
Cutting em out ain't even the biggest incision
My decision is purely based on my sitting position
Hip-Hop head is how I'm living I'm bumping it was written

Went to school and didn't listen
Sometimes I think bout all I'm missing but I can't be when I'm hitting like-

Dilla disciple in the studio for days
Vision over the horizon you can't catch this gaze
Focused on doing my best so don't complain if it's late
Ask where I'm going might just leave it to fate
Titled the tape Old Soul but my shoes look clean
Planning for the future when I've got a team
Hate ain't my message go ahead and test it
Only write what's true to me, you can see, best bet

I can't stand to fall when command is too tall
Breaking em all down to dust like we discussed
The fans between success and us
Delivering the fire for our return
Get too close and you're easily burned
Chilling at the crib call me up and we'll live
For this music I strive helps me stay alive

[Intro: AKIR]
Yo, I don’t know who the fuck you think you’re dealing with, man.  Nah, stop the crying.  I can’t take this no more, man.  All I do is bring food home to these kids.  I got a roof over your head and you watch fucking soap operas all day and lay on your ass.  And you’re gonna tell me about me?  Yo, fuck this shit.  Man, I’m out of here.  B, I’m out.  Hey!

[Verse 1: AKIR]
Yo, they say that we’re endangered species.  AKIR’s thesis is
To survive ten times ten.  Not in a ten by ten
Ten times out of ten, they got a plan for my
Hard rocks that have not had babies that start again
He stole her love.  How could she ever give her heart again?
She opened up.  He closed the door, never had sparks again
Went through some men to validate she’s a queen
Never found a king.  The pain made her turn to a fiend
Feeling low, getting high the only way she sees dreams
Stays at home, watching soaps, thinks she part of the screen
To get away from a day and the kid’s hunger screams, she buys
Something fly, though it seems out of her mean
Yo, behind, she still gets ahead.  This dude was real red
Something on his head.  Plus, she liked the way he worked it
In bed.  Thirsting to wed, settle down is what [?] did
And so she did it too, simply to fight the ridicule
He made her life miserable.  Except the kids, of course
So they got a divorce up in court.  Child support
Hearings bad as Hell and the only pair of earrings
Chanel perfume while her suit was crisp, splitting
She screams, “From the beginning, situations was trife”
The judge says, “I don’t care, bitch.  This is your life”
[Hook: AKIR]
Even though there’s trouble, we’ll still be on the hustle
Stuck behind the struggle, we’re still ready to rumble
Although we built it up, it’s still ready to crumble
Foundation ain’t tight, man, this is your life
Forever in the game, it’s hard not to fumble
Trying to maintain or strive but still stumble
Rocking big chains, it’s hard to stay humble
Forever in a fight, child, this is your life

[Verse 2: AKIR]
First step behind the eight ball.  Can’t even crawl
Ain’t no time to watch your back.  Thoughts of that caught
Some cats, so cautious acts come out as fear
Big dogs in your ear with their 40s of beer become
Accessories to your New Year.  Freshman year
Situation cloudy as a child but now clear
Problems seem distance but they’re still near
House needs money for diapers.  Uncle’s a lifer
Pops left fast.  No gas left in your lighter
Moms getting high, listening to Earth, Wind & Fire
Old-timers tell you how they always dreamed to retire before
Their life expires.  Doing wild shit made you a livewire
Looking for fame, pops dropped the ball, sub in
The game.  Your terrain, so you’re doing your thing
Big chains and lots of women lock chains and switching linen
It’s only the beginning.  Losing your mind to keep winning
And while you focus on immediate living, they’re having
Children and classmates focus on glass ceilings.  Only to
Clear up their debt without facing arrest.  The streets
Got you pet niggas, so you’re wearing a vest
Stress internally hexed by society’s death threats
Born in the struggle, always grew up in trouble, where niggas
Snuff you just to prove their muscle.  Live for their money
To double in bundles, ready to die for their hustle
[Hook: AKIR]
Even though there’s trouble, we’ll still be on the hustle
Stuck behind the struggle, we’re still ready to rumble
Although we built it up, it’s still ready to crumble
Foundation ain’t tight, man, this is your life
Forever in the game, it’s hard not to fumble
Trying to maintain or strive but still stumble
Rocking big chains, it’s hard to stay humble
Forever in a fight, child, this is your life",rap

Cause I'm not your bubble, and I don't want no trouble
Anything for my bit, cause she my blessing
It's a blessing

All y'all copy
Leave 'em money on monopoly

I was eating chili, I was getting it like Shawn
Y'all acting like Kong, aye
I was in that studio, and tryna being hard
All these days, I just bought a car
What is you doing, I ain't tweaking
But you acting like you have been freezing, woo!
I got all my dudes in the game like Lecrae (Crae!)
Blessings falling in the earth, so I'm like “Hey”
And every blessing is a good day
Tell them I need a verse
Getting on texts, and saw the LG Phone
Prolly never read the first

Very pretty swimming round
The lion and the unicorn journey very far
The answers are the question, sir
The lady soothes the lion's fur
Meek as a lamb he follows her
Wherever angels are

Sing me something
I asked the ice it would not say
But only cracked or moved away
I thought I knew me yesterday
Whoever sings this song

Ducks on a pond, ducks on a pond
Very pretty swimming round
Greetings on you kings in the sky
Who'll buy me a mynah bird
Play me a magic word
Speak of hopes with thoughts absurd
Thoughts floating by
Little ducks, pretty birds
Clouds across the sky
Sing me something
I asked the ice, it would not say
But only cracked or moved away
I thought I knew me yesterday
Whoever sings this song

Moving pieces on the plains of Troy
Carving faces on the rocks of joy
Pretty lady washing the tiles
Soapy pictures like crocodiles

Chilly, chilly, chilly, chilly winds blowing
Lovely spring coming soon

I wear my body like a caravan
Gipsy rover in a magic land
Misty mountains where the eagles fly
Lonely valleys where the lost ones cry

I had a little letter full of paper
Inky scratches everywhere
Always looking, looking for a paradise island
Help me find it everywhere

Peacocks talking of the colour grey
Awaking soundly in darkest day
A howling tempest on a silent sea
Lovely Jesus nailed to a tree
Had a little letter full of paper
Inky scratches everywhere
Always looking, looking for a paradise island
Help me find it everywhere

Mad as the moon when Merlin falls
Silver castles and silver halls
Taking lessons from the piper's son
Learn to play while the world is young

Boys and girls come out to play
The moon doth shine as bright as day
Leave your sorrows and leave your sleep
And join your playfellows in the street
Come with a whoop or come with a call
Come with a goodwill or not at all
Up the ladder and down the wall
A ha'penny loaf will serve for all

Following my fortune now the Holy Grail is found
And the Holy Bread of Heaven, it is given all around
Farewell sorrow, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world any more

Poor as the birds but to give their song away
Gathering possessions round to make a fine array
Dark was the night, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
I ain't got no home in this world anymore
Farewell sorrow, praise God the open door
I ain't got no home in this world any more",pop

Huffed some cans of spray paint and began to vomit blood
One more night in this town's gonna break me, I just know

Stumbled on down Indian Hill, tail between my legs
Sick taste in my mouth, Folgers Crystals and hard boiled eggs
If I can't run away tonight, I don't know what I'll do
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone beats them out of you

Do what you have to do, go where you have to go

Hand you your necklace back. Put some ice on it

Dream lucidly, try and see how deep I can fade
It’s bugged. Take a stroll in my subconscious
Where foul thoughts crumble the walls that block it
Mentally I’m crooked and cracked
White man say it’s ‘hood in me, could it be that?
I reflect and repel, I’m out of your reach
Too r-a-w for retail
I’m deep like hellraiser’s box, heavenly release

I am a piece of nothing and my soul can never die
That's the reason why I came back today:
To effect the ancient prophecy
My time levitation was the key
One step into nowhere to see
Finding sketches of Gethsemane
Here in ""Sundown Factory""

No way
No way out
No way out

Born in a time where my God means just creation
And where death alternates with the sovereign of hell
Let me change things today

Hey you, are you waiting for the end?
The Sanhedrin says you will die here today
But why me? Why's not anybody else?
Finding the way out of time to Jerusalem
My life is a flame
And her pale light shines on sadness
Of my grey solitude
That made a something out of me
Just a thing out of me

Hey you, tell me this is just a dream!
Why can't you say we are leaving today
And why me? Why not anybody else?
I'm so afraid on my way to Jerusalem

Turn the navigation gear
Just for another thousand years
And then my spheroid will fall down
In another world

Am I losing my mind, losing my mind?
I have waited for somebody, somebody wrong

""The Seraphic Clockwork"" says:
""And he will find the Babylonian apiary
Of petrified books in the serpent delta of a Styx""
He came, the pristine sin to turn
Betrayed him for quicksilver
And then he kissed him
Just a kiss, a Judas kiss, and then he kissed him
Just a kiss, a Judas kiss, just a question
And then he kissed him
Time's an equinoxium, and I'm the devil's key
To save a paradoxon with infernal perfidy

Hey you, tell me this is just a dream!
Why can't you say we are leaving today
And why me? Why not anybody else?
Please say I'm late on my way to Jerusalem

And there is no place left to hide
For me, the holy parasite
Because my unfulfilled sacrament
Has changed time and must change time

All kinds of details falling right out of the sky
""Not Unimmortal"" if your father let you die
God's time levitation found a way
To make you a savior today
I'm just a lie
I'm not a friend, just a sick corrosive saint

Now you walk your way all alone
To carry the sins of the world
I came to dethrone and to betray you
So they crucify you for another life
A better day to free the world
(God's time levitator found a way)
To heal all kinds of things
(To make you a savior today)
And take all souls on board
(Me, the parallel Judas will burn)
You die to save us all

And my hand take hold on judgment..

And I will repay those that hazed me..

When you got bass all in your face
Sub woofers pumpin' all throughout the place
A fake rap nigga tryna plead his case
It's about to be, a catastrophe
And if you got beehive's, right before your eyes
About to start shit that'll attract the flies
And then you hear lies, followed by some cries
It's about to be, a catastrophe

[Verse 1: GZA]
Half of these rap lyrics ain't thoughts prevoked
Just alotta beef, til they get caught in smoke
But the problem is never cured, on top of that
Most of them be swingin' wild and then drop the bat
Many curious spectators, watch the human drama
This rap cat was all in the street without his armor
A homicidal attempt, that had failed
He flew off the roof, on the fence, got impaled
He talked a good one, but it was make believe
Much too low, for the human ear to perceive
He confused science fiction with science facts
He couldn't separate the block, from the recorded tracks
Need a rhyme or the tactic, gotta work your magic
Detailed and graphic, but the outcome is tragic
Something built to a complex network
With a panoramic vision, designed by experts
I be the ice breaker, for you unskilled skaters
I increase the heat significantly, just on paper

[Verse 2: GZA]
No matter what, I'm throwin' an iller dart
I can lay a verse, that'll soften a killer's heart
As fire as a five alarm blaze, that's too hot to be holding
You feel the heat, once the flame pumps lace your clothing
What some talk about, had little or no bearing
Could the next be some real shit, that's far from comparing
Materialistic M.C.'s, come off boring
Meanwhile, I be sketching up, deposit drawings
Through the years, a countless, number of victories
Changing the era, we swarm unpredictably
A rhyme book is not, difficult to manage
I leave a mic in a bandage, from catastrophic damage
Rap niggas on a trip, gotta steal your sandwich
So I creeped, division reports was left on canvas
I made it through the worst extremes of cold weather
Scuffed up, but remained durable as old leather
But I hold the pen, you feel the whiff of Polo wind
Something like Jesus, when he civilize older men
The math that shed light, all across the borders
If our wisdom was the vast expands of fresh waters

With a textbook by side I never really read
40 minute bus journey so they can teach me

Various aspects I like to watch  and see

The people not the landscapes, trying to write their own CV
Just wanna really leave can’t really lie and deiceve Trees so bare can’t grow leaves with veins here

Picking up some stuff with a load of fucking seeds
To conceal all the boredom that I feel inside my city
Feeling academically pretty pathetic

They work on negative reinforcement embellish
My failures and stresses, this is pretty fucking hellish
Pounds and pleasures that diminish quick and hide away the stresses
Pressures on my shoulder blades got me acting pretty reckless

Venture into label culture with a new colour
New picture, new structure, that’s the Cambridge conductor
Spill cyphers inspired by the flame of the lighter

In the claustrophobic sunny day sangeeth looking over my way
Knowing that I’m being a poet rather than uh…

Following the trace of the red pen on the white board
The red like a traffic light signifies and singnal signs
To be opening my soul, I need to stop and create
This is not the place where I was born make my slate

3437,"THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, everybody, for being here today.  It is with great pride, very great pride, that I say these words to you right now:  Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  (Applause.)  Welcome to the White House.  (Applause.)

I want to congratulate you, Jeff, your wife Mary, and your entire family.  Jeff Sessions has been a federal prosecutor at the highest level and at the most respected level, a state attorney general, and then a U.S. senator for two decades.  He has devoted his life to the cause of justice and believes deeply that all people are equals in the eyes of the law -- and very importantly for Jeff and for so many of us, also in the eyes of God.

He’s a man of integrity, a man of principle, and a man of total, utter resolve.  You just got a little witnessing of that.  That resolve is what we need right now.  America faces many challenges.  We face the menace of rising crime and the threat of deadly terror.  And it’s not getting better, but it will get better very soon.  It’s going to get a lot better.

These dangerous times require a determined attorney general, which is what Jeff is.  Jeff understands that the job of attorney general is to serve and protect the people of the United States, and that is exactly what he will do, and do better than anybody else can.  He’s trained better for it than anybody else.  The level of respect that he has throughout this country as a former prosecutor, not even to mention being a long-time U.S. senator, is absolutely incredible.

He will be a great protector of the people.  I’m signing three executive actions today designed to restore safety in America.  These executive actions continue to deliver on my campaign promises.

First, I’m directing Department of Justice and Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people, many other people.

Secondly, I’m directing Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime in America.

And thirdly, I’m directing the Department of Justice to implement a plan to stop crime and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers.  It’s a shame what’s been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers.  That’s going to stop as of today.

Today’s ceremony should be seen as a clear message to the gang members and drug dealers terrorizing innocent people.  Your day is over.  A new era of justice begins, and it begins right now.

I want to again thank and congratulate Mary and our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  I wish you God’s wisdom and blessings in your journey.  Mr. Vice President, would you please conduct the swearing-in.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for being here, everyone.  (Applause.)

(The Attorney General is sworn in.)
ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS:  Mr. President, thank you for this great honor.  It’s something I never expected would happen in my life, but I do love the Department of Justice.  I care about its traditions and its heritage.  I had 15 years in that great department, and the honor to lead it now is something that I do not have words to express effectively.

There are a lot of things we need to do.  First, we need to value and support and encourage the fabulous people who work there.  I’ve worked with them over the years.  I know how good they are, and their talents need to be directed at this nation’s benefit in a lot of different ways.  We have a crime problem.  I wish the blip -- I wish the rise that we are seeing in crime in America today were some sort of aberration or a blip.  My best judgement, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk.  We will deploy the talents and abilities of the Department of Justice in the most effective way possible to confront this rise in crime and to protect the people of our country.

We have an increased threat, since I was a United States attorney, from terrorism.  Mr. President, you’ve spoken firmly on that.  You’ve led this nation to say we’re going to respond effectively to the threat of terrorism, and you can count on your Department of Justice to do so in an effective way.  And you’ve said something that I believe and I think the American people believe -- that we need a lawful system of immigration; one that serves the interests of the people of the United States.  That’s not wrong, that’s not immoral, that’s not indecent.  We admit a million people a year plus, lawfully, and we need to end this lawlessness that threatens the public safety, pulls down wages of working Americans.

It is an honor beyond words to serve under you and your leadership.  You’re putting together a great Cabinet, which is just a thrill for me to have the opportunity to join.  And I look forward to making sure that every ounce of strength I have and that the people of the Department of Justice have is going to be focused on preserving and protecting the Constitution and the safety of this country.  We will defend the laws of this country as passed by Congress.  We will defend the lawful orders of the President of the United States with vigor and determination.

Thank you all for being here, I see a lot of good friends, and may God bless all our efforts.  Thank you.  (Applause.)",misc

I phoned out for some pizza on home delivery
When the guy arrived he looked familiar to me
The side burns and the glasses were a dead giveaway
The bill said nine bucks fifty was what I had to pay
I said why don't we make it an even ten bucks
I knew it was him when he said ""Thank you very much""

Dead Guys, Dead Gals getting into the groove
'Cos rising from the dead is such a great career move
Elvis is alive will the rumours ever cease
His face appeared to me in a plate of Bacon grease

Dead people are appearing on my street everyday
I've seen Buddy Holly, Mama Cass and JFK
Hendrix brings the milk around, Vic Morrow mows the lawn
And if you look you can see Jesus, he brings the paper round at dawn
Elvis is alive and it caused a reaction
When he gave away Lisa-Marie as she married Michael Jackson

Dead Guys, Dead Gals getting into the groove
'Cos rising from the dead is such a great career move
Elvis is alive it's easy to see
'Cos when I'm frying bananas I can hear him calling me",pop

7626,"It's not like we didn't go the extra mile we tried
Got painted into corners had to wait until the floors dried
Lying in bed, letting thoughts drift ahead may they touch the rift
That turns a sure thing into ifs
Perhaps the cliffs we climb sap the drifting mind
I couldn't let it go still I left it all behind
I miss you in my bed it's getting harder to wake up
I used loved the way we fought then fucked to make up

But now you wouldn't know me see I've changed in ways
Gone over the alleged edge in these strange days
But be that as it may, I mingle every single day
On the surface and do things out of love on purpose
With nervous ticks, I keep my nose in my business
That's filled with failed tactics, walk the line like a fascist
I could of practiced more acting but I'm looking for fulfilling
Feeling the pulling of sitting back and just chilling

I'm in process of making rapid progress
Got some projects on the go but it's slow at the office
Glad I don't have a girl, but I want to be wanted
I approach undaunted. See if you got, you flaunt it
I'm on it like my ex on my best man
Thought sex was less than expected. Never been so disrespected
I'm getting past the point shoots keep pushing through the ground
But fuck it, I ain't tripping but I keep falling down
It's been real rainy, my bed's been so empty
Though I know there's plenty of fish in the sea to tempt me
But this time is meant for me to vent and finding plenty
Of things to do inside but not really doing anything
But thinking and reading and drinking and dreaming
And staying up late night in smoky bars screaming
Let me in. Let me out. Hold it in Get it out
Get a grip got a hold it fits now break the mold

Horus]
Sleeping most of my days away
Then waking up in a blaze of gray
Just can't pull it off and face the day
So I'm sleeping most of my days away

Just another bitter literalist hate liberal arts
Literature and get literally pissed
Pour out a little liquor for your dead mind
What a bitter bind you can let the light in and still
There ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness everyday
I wonder this time where's she gone
And if she's gone to stay

I must insist, for this US to exist
We have to learn to live alone and keep growing on our own
I know right from wrong and know sight from song
And slight but strong, I take flight, BUT despite I'm hanging on
Damn right I'm doing dope things, I can't help growing
Gotta keep on keeping on, the lawn needs mowing
The dishes need doing, I need to do some more screwing
And usually I'm pretty choosy but when boozy only human...
And if you see me at the party wearing nothing but a lamp shade
You'll know I've come apart but that at least I've got bandaids
The band played on for the handmaidens who remained
And the dudes who stayed on, got laid til day dawned
I've made claims before that were different than my aims
Now I stand behind my words and I'm not calling out names
Like which Claire was it, and where was it located
I still have the naked photos of a few ladies I dated

I know you're listening cause sometimes I can hear you
And if it's nearby, I can feel your heart beating
We keep leaving things being it's not easy to contain
Keeping ominously calm when it never stays the same
Weaving through time like your touch could soothe my mind
I used to find clues to who I was but now I'm blind drunk
On wine reaching punk rock plateaus then retching
And I'm not depressed I just passed out resting",pop

Upon my hand on summer day
I thought I saw my true love standing
In the sand
One old may day
I thought I hear the dolphins sing
'You gotta bring her back
On summer day'
See her run along the tide line
Where the trade winds blow
Feel the breath of summer
In her hair, oh!
Underneath the shooting stars
I've wished and would you know
I thought I saw a swallow land
Upon my hand
On summer day
I thought I saw a swallow land
Upon my hand on summer day
But here in cold midwinter's night
Another light has come to play
Steals across the misty sky
And bye and bye
She'll maybe stay
Can there ever be again again
Another spring
Will the birds forever hold us
On the wing
Light the fire in our home of hearts
And hear me sing

Niggas is sick of it, let it go, and get a grip

Slow death to anyone who oppose me

Sun I’m a always shine, yellow
Think I’m about to get up on that? HELL NO
Long as shorty keep my tip hard, shell toe
Certain I’m a stick to the script, velcro
Ringers?, fakers, thinker, faders, prosper
Without being linked to the majors
My only response is the finger to haters
Watch it get ugly, Mbenga, Lakers
So when they ask how I feel about hip hop
I sighed and replied take a lucky guess
Just being sincere, I ain’t talking pioneer’s
When I tell dudes I don’t think the Dougie’s fresh
Used to roll through the trenches, slept on cold benches
Holds on my expenses, smoke till I was senseless
Now the flow’s so relentless
Fuck CD’s it should be sold in syringes
I can’t explain it they love the sound
Subtle with the pound, you don’t want trouble clown
If I’m at the bar ordering a couple rounds
I’m in between 2 birds like a double down
Where I’m from they cock and shoot
Like it’s all logical, send a lot of work to them hospitals
Dress the AK up before they pop at you
Handgun’s, night scope, call it the Chopper suit
So if you tired of all the wack dudes, call me in
Rap historian, slash my class’s Valedictorian
Your future’s at a stand still
Must be a flat on that Delorean
I tried tellin them conceded the deals closed
They disagree they believe that they real close
Tough guys turn talk show like Steve Wilko’s
Scream fuck em eat dildos with each pill dose
All the rap dudes they got highly regarded
Tell me they psyche might be slightly retarded
Nowadays before the shows I buy me a cartridge
Those them phony ass dudes they like me to start with
Peepin how the vets wanna stop me
Money where your mouth is Ted DiBiase
And he won’t be able to reach for a biscuit
With O’s on his head like a B-more fitted
Black hoody and black tux
Tearin stacks up, with a model and her rack tough
Gettin my Extreme Makeover on
Knock that bitch down and build her back up
Think twice before you act up
Around flames, wrong time to be gassed up
You never heard blowing smoke from a grass hut
9 times out of 10 it’ll be your last puff
(Hook)
I think I’m Sug’ Ray, Ali
Joe Fraiz’ who the fuck gon stop me

8438,"The adult contemporary music world was softly rocked this week by the news that Tom Petty would be getting a writing credit on Sam Smith's 2014 hit ""Stay With Me,"" which turns out to be much the same song as Petty's 1989 ""I Won't Back Down."" Listen to this mashup if you don't believe it:

Stay With Me/I Won't Back Down

We applaud. Justice has run down like waters, like a mighty stream. But can Tom Petty really claim the moral high ground here?

It could just be our ears, but we've always been nagged by the similarity between Petty's ""Here Comes My Girl""—you know, ""Here comes my giiiirrrrrlllllllll""—

Here Comes My Girl

And the Bert Berns classic ""Here Comes the Night,"" made famous by Van Morrison:

Here Comes the Night

Listen to Van. Now listen to Petty. Is that not the same damn hook with two words changed and half the soul surgically removed?

Maybe that's really our beef here: ""Here Comes the Night"" is a raw ode to lost love, fresh jealousy, and tormented insomnia (""the long, the long, the lonely night""). ""Here Comes My Girl"" is, well, ""Here comes my giiiirrrrrlllllllll...""

Nothing against Petty in general; his career has had plenty of finer moments. But now that he's making a little extra money off another artist's sticky fingers, shouldn't he cop to his own?

And if that day of reckoning ever comes, can we, as a culture, also find the strength to admit that ""Rolling in the Deep"" is really a Gnarls Barkley song?",rock

Hour of the wolf is drawing near
Killing time approaches as the clock strikes
As it falls

Wolf pack on the prowl
Soft blood boiling in the moonlight
Guest to the labyrinth, has lost his way
Caught in a prison of holy madmen
Hour of the wolf is drawing near
Soft blood rises, spilling over
King of the labyrinth, king of fear
Vision of life's end, dream or nightmare
Hour of the wolf is here

Everyhting was unfair on my world
Actually i had been gone already
When the cops arrived there
But gogos were still the purpose
Which was the main on my life

I know i wasn't so clever

I fell in love with the girl on the street yesterday
I told her then like the others
She gone far away and far away

Don't you ever abide

They’re buried like forceps

Last time I saw you
You told me about a book you'd read

""Answered Prayers""
Written in the style we dread

Ruthless in it's use of fiction as a blind for the truth

Everyone's a slave to fact
And still we never seem to get it right

Our discourses
Using storied sources
So many feeble
So many people working in the abstract
In due reflection, the patterns were there
People gaze upon cycles
In awe and despair

Bend straight lines
Quotidian thoughts
About the Dark Age, the 60s, the 90s and the aughts

Pondering, intellectually wan
Like all devoted fans
We never notice
…when we're on the jumbotron

Pining for some age bygone

""O thoughts of men accurs'd!
Past and to come seem best; things present, worst""

Ah, these storied sentiments
Dare we ever rest?
When every meager folly
Is clear in all respects?

Gave away so much swag, I think they really owe me
I'm trying to find myself, so how the fuck these niggas know me
How the fuck they gon know me

Crying hard to God just to get this blessing
Putting friends before my family was my hardest lesson
I had no guidance, I just learn from my own mistakes
I'm gon get to the top no matter the gates
I gotta climb for it

I love Angela, but really need my real mom
The happiest she seen me was my school prom
Maybe its the dress that i wore
Maybe its the best that she scored
Cause she got bragging rights
Your daughter looking nice
I'm looking like her son
I don't think its sitting right
With her
And I'm still tryna make it happen
I had bars in the mirror
Should of seen me rapping

I been prep myself for this
In the mirror hear me wish
My life destined for this shit
Everyday I'm practicing
Cause I eat, sleep, and shit rap
Can't be on beats with no mumble bars
Cause that shit is not rap
Can't let you niggas beat me no
Grinding hard, I'm soon gon blow
I was taught the hardest working  person is who's next to blow
So while these niggas sleep
Tune gon creep

On the train making beats

5094,"You're pretty for a dark skin girl, the typical expression
To give praise to your looks while downplaying your complexion
This type of compliment is conveyed with the deception
That dark women ain't really cute, but you make a good exception
As if Black and beautiful cannot coexist
Ever since the fall of man our view of beauty has gone adrift
When sin entered the world, so did opinion
We went from, ""Behold, it was good"", to, ""What can we do to fix it?""
So let's take a ride and, travel through time
To a king who had 700 wives and 300 concubines
He knew a woman from every creed and every tribe
But only one caught his eye to make him start writing rhymes
The Song of Solomon, written to extol his melanated lover
And to the surprise of many, this lover was none other
Than the Shulamite, translated in the Hebrew as ""O perfect one""
But unconvinced of her own essence, this title she would shun
At first she said, ""I am dark, but lovely"", probably said it with a snap
But then she said, ""Look not upon me because I am Black
You ever felt like that? Come on, let's be true
One moment you're on top of the world
The next, the world is on top of you
Injustice and mistreatment has put us on the defense
Handling our uniqueness as a defect
They ridicule our fuel to keep it locked within our chocolate skin
Then wonder why we're not comfortable in the shoes they moccasin
In this instance we must keep in remembrance
That pigment doesn't negate that we're made in God's image
So despite what the serpent tells you on the surface level
There is still a certain treasure in your earthen vessel
But let's get back to Solomon
Because Solomon made a song praising the Black woman
Which is why today's music makes me sick to my stomach
We went from, ""Return, O Shulamite; that we may look upon thee""
To, “Where them yellow bones? I don’t want no Black {BEEP}
We lift our hands and we do our dance
To songs infused with the mission statement of the Ku Klux Klan
We're too tucked in, 2 sheets to the wind
Too sleep to defend, come on, men
God planted a beautiful garden
But while men slept tares were planted amongst the harvest
And because we were too dozed to stand strong
It forced our women to put pants on and assume the man role
We were supposed to protect you, we were supposed to uplift you
I don't stand before you guiltless, sistahs, I repent too
For every song I played that called you out of your name
That looked past your crown and reinforced your chains
For every time my insecurities caused you distress
And every time I reintroduced the Brown Paper Bag Test
Y'all know they used to hold a brown paper bag to our face like this
And if you were lighter, you progressed
If you were darker, they said, ""Next!"", our society been a mess
Racism and colorism
What will it take to liberate us from this prison?
How about a brown skin Middle Eastern Jew
One Who would lay down His life for me and you
Skin color didn't affect His decision to spread love
Showing that the only color that matters is His red blood
You are valid no matter what skin you're in
You're not pretty for a dark skin girl, you're pretty, period
And this is to every hue, every tone and every shade
You are fearfully and wonderfully made",misc

Hey young one

So innocent

Where i’m from
Seen the future
You’ve yet to face

I ain't here to try and scare you
But rather help you live the life that you were really meant to
I'm tryna give you what I was missing
So i could turn out different
And maybe find a way out of this system

The daily 9-5 that wastes the highlights of our lives
And then we're slowly fed the lie, that if we work hard and we try

That we can make our dreams come true
Like i wanted to live in a cubicle

And i’m not talking bout those 4 walls and a desk
It's the mental stress
That makes us believe our CV is our sense of self
And taking a break is treated the same as professional death

It's a carrot
When they dangle that success in front of us
And now that you've seen your future I'm sure that you just wanna run

Entitled kids
Might not think
That its harder for us to succeed because they don't see the higher risk

We have to face
Just to chase
A dream that's far away
All while knowing if we fail
There won't be another chance

And we can't rely on getting bail outs from mom and dad
Cause they are hoping we will put the money in their hands
These kind of pressures are what that separates us by class
So just realize in this game when you start the deck is stacked

Against your favour so you better not take each thing for granted
Always take advantage of each opportunity and learn to manage

Your financial state
So you can make each pound last you for days
And then you'll own your time again
Which is worth giving up a salary

Then spend your free time investing into your skill set
Success isn't certain so learn to be happy regardless
And the future's always a mystery
So prepare yourself and be ready
And who knows one day I might even end up reaching this dream-

I'll probably put this on the front of you diss… mixtape and I know you'll do great things at Cal Poly

This is the Natalie Rubio Anthem
Rubios.Tacos, Guiseppe stalking, Lydia talking shit
Luis Garnica, nice to see ya, Andre Drew just quit
I'm already famous, Insta-Famous, 2.Much.Clout
Shut your mouth, all you ever do is pout
You're literal pollution, beef is your solution, don't believe in evolution
It was so easy, that's why we dissed you, shitposting it all over YouTube
LiMBaOw, this song is turnin into a diss track

Stop, let's take it way way way back
To that time we housepartied, you embarrassed me, for me it wasn't so so lovely
Screamin my lungs, it was so much fun, had to clarify to Paulina
Thinking back it didn't even matter
Cause three weeks later she took the latter

A breakup can make up a person for the better
Personally I was under the weather
Bakubakuabkaubkauba
Thanks for the response doc
I've only seen one episode, so please pardon me
Can't wait to see where the ship sails: Donna Harvey
I'm losing my focus, hocus pocus, running out of time
Smush a penny and a dime, the next lyrics are sublime

Brochella, BroCELLA, Santino, Fat Pony
Robotics, and Pirates, Disney ignored me
Duck the FONS, director on standby
Pokémon Go, Dons Island, Heck's Kitchen, oh time flies

Hopefully these lyrics stuck longer than the gum wall
This is the end for Andre Drew, Andy Rew, and all of my personas

I think about who I might be
'Cause sometimes

But I know
That in the universe
There's a bigger plan for me
And sometimes I feel just like I'm cursed
Again
But I'm not the only man to ever question my word

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know
That in the universe
There's a bigger plan for me
And sometimes I feel just like I'm cursed
But I'm not the only man to ever question my word
[Chorus]
But I know that I'll come through the other side
And you better believe I'm strong enough to put up a real good fight
Sometimes you don’t realise

How dark it’s been
Until you see the light again

Screaming for vengeance under blood red skies, looming disorder and moral decline
Vile consumption of extorted funds, one way path to our destruction
…to our destruction
Clutch your independence, but stare into the abyss, grinning as you wallow in the muck of avarice
Scream for redemption in a sea of fools, knowing inaction is the devils tool
The heavens are burning but I won’t live a slave, I’ll sacrifice because dead men feel no pain
…dead men feel no pain
Dreams become nightmares beneath tyranny, Repeating the nations wretched history
Embrace the objective, with my intentions clear
To decimate the oppression; freedom is more powerful than fear
At war with shadows but exist as the night, Legions of the grave march towards the light
With the wings of an eagle and the jaws of a snake, the ironhawk’s rise to put an end to the state
The heavens are burning but i won’t live a slave, i’ll sacrifice because dead men feel no pain
…dead men feel no pain
Legions of the grave, Dead men feel no pain",rock

Can I spend time to watch? Can I spend time for less?
If I stay in my old haunt with these ghosts all around
Can I spend time to watch, can I spend time to drown?
With these ghosts all around, we’ve been sitting here for days
The silence is the loudest in my head since last May
Even if we don’t want to leave here today
With these ghosts all around, we’ve been starring at for days
With time, time, time ticking
If I stay in my old haunt with these ghosts all around
Can I spend time to watch, can I spend time to drown?
In the belly of New York City, losing hour by each hour
Chasing daytime into night, I follow darkness for a while

Swimming with minnows, we learn to swim like the rest

5526,"Of this world’s theatre in which we stay,
My love like the spectator idly sits,
Beholding me, that all the pageants play,
Disguising diversly my troubled wits.
Sometimes I joy when glad occasion fits,
And mask in mirth like to a comedy:
Soon after, when my joy to sorrow flits,
I wail, and make my woes a tragedy.
Yet she, beholding me with constant eye,
Delights not in my mirth nor rues my smart:
But when I laugh she mocks, and when I cry
She laughs, and hardens evermore her heart.
What then can move her? If nor mirth nor moan,
She is no woman, but a senseless stone.",misc

5809,"Lemme tell you a little fact
Since I've started writing rap
A lot of nobodies heads
Became experts
""I was expecting this
I was expecting that""
Making claims like they taught Tupac
Man, thanks, now can you take your hands
And pull two middle fingers up your ass?
To be sincere I wanna make clear
That when I look at the mirror
I don't feel superior
But I don't need the opinion
Of who talks but doesn't know
What the fuck is talking about, like television
Sorry was that too hard?
""Maybe""
Okay, okay, I'll move on
""Thanks""
You know what's good about writing?
I can spit from my mouth everything's coming
From my fucked up brain
I don't even worry about rhyming
If you don't think about it, words strike like lightning
It's a glorifying pain
Won't hide my name, I don't want fame
It's inhumane to choose a jail
Instead of a fucking life
Now hide from the hurricane
It's not difficult to rap fast
It's difficult to make last
A machine with no fuel smashed
Understand the metaphor
Maybe I'm incomprehensible
Even if you read the words
You'll probably need to read
Yhem again to comprehend
What the fuck I said
Maybe I'm just a dreamer
Nonbeliever that a river
Can dry without anyone seeing it
I'm being split
If it's true that you don't like to be fooled
Tell me why the fuck if I tell you what I think
You're not gonna be that cool about it
Do you really wanna talk about it?

Told you I'm honest, you doubted?

Shit, that I'm gonna spill
All over the place so
When you smell it you'll know
That I've been here before
You even made your first step
Now you won't fly away from my web

""So let's recap what you said
You think that people on the internet
Shouldn't talk without knowing facts""
Yeah, I guess
""And that they all should be dead""
Wait, what? That's not what I meant
""Okay we're done with the interview, thanks""
No, wait! And she's gone, Ah fuck it

Mad, I'm going mad with this
Man, my balls are filled with
Shit, that I'm gonna spill
All over the place so

Well, there's not, but there was
She was always down on me

I used to think it was gravity
Now I'm pretty sure it's self esteem

It still doesn't bother me
Entirely in the silence of the dar
She said, ""I don't even think that
Danzig is that cool anymore""

There she stood, half naked
But not that the half that gets men dreaming
And she talked about love
And the current state of the scene
""I heard it's not as good as it used to be
But we can always smoke out the room and see
How many shapes we can twist in the fog
And stay up late talking about God

And those we've loved before

Repeat Chorus

Verse 2:
Bumping ""Gz Up Hoez Down""
In that '93 850
Thats the same year ""Doggystyle"" dropped
So I owe it to my pops
Couple crackers
Listening to crazy bay area rappers like
Spice 1, Dre Dog and Brotha Lynch
Eating intestines and shit
""Rest In Piss""
Homage to Death Row, thats what I grew up with
But I'm smart enough to know I ain't gon' do no dumb shit
Half these new rappers is unreal
The other half is real
And half of those already have a deal
I write a rap like I just wrote a 'script
If you can't handle my shit then lighten up you bitch
I'm just a normal dude rapping on this mic and shit
And I made this fucking beat so I own this whole shit
So play me motherfucker
Yeah BUT FIRST YOU GOTTA PAY ME MOTHERFUCKER!
YEAH!

5900,"I'm a man of the land
A wanderer with no clan
Can't live the life my instincts say I oughta
I'm a man of the land
A devil in demand
But love would see me walk across the water

I spend my time in bars and cash in cars under the stars
I spend my tender times morose
You all say you love the sound of breaking glass
'Til the pieces fall too close

I'm a man of the land
A wanderer with no clan
Can't live the life my instincts say I oughta
I'm a man of the land
A devil in demand
But love would see me walk across the water

I spend my days surrounded by these screaming, seething screens
I spend my evenings far away
All my favourite teenage dreams were movie scenes
Cut through my twenties like a blade
Cos I only feel like me when I'm where I've never been
And my waltzer working days have spun away
So roll up and test your mettle
Where the dust never settles
And you never win no matter how you play
All the people that I know, in the places that I go
Say to me ""Why can't you be more pleasant?""
But for all the late night bars, and their euphorias
All I ever really wanna feel is present

But for all the late night bars, and their euphorias
All I ever really wanna feel is present
All I ever really wanna feel is present

I'm a man on a mission
A compelling proposition
To adore before this sore world leaves me cold
There's a time I would return to
Cos only love can hurt you
And love has learned to leave me well alone
I'm a man of the land
Take my comfort where I can
I find it in the flora and the fauna
I'm a man of the land
Hate is painted on my hands
But love is only one look round the corner

I'm a man of the land
The sirens understand
Did they not send the red skies out to warn ya?
I'm a man of the land
No face tatts or Xans
I come from Cally Road not California
I'm a man of the land
A wanderer with no clan
Can't live the life my instincts say I oughta
I'm a man of the land
A devil in demand

Living inside funeral daydreams

Shivering and desperate

And reality. Climbing high no gravity
Pulling me down and my conceited mentality

One is the love for the soul and the mic

About her in my heart

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day

V Stiviano: No. I don't believe it in my heart.

Barbara Walters: Have you heard him say derogatory things about minorities in general or blacks in particular?

V Stiviano: Absolutely, yes.

Barbara Walters:  You've heard him say derogatory things, don't they sound racist to you?

V Stiviano: I think the things he says are not what he feels. Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment.

Barbara Walters: Not everybody makes alleged racist remarks in the heat of the moment. Sometimes you say things-

V Stiviano: That you mean. Or that you feel.

Barbara Walters: Explain how he says these things.

V Stiviano: I think Mr. Sterling is from a different generation than I am. I think he was brought up to believe those things.

Barbara Walters: What things?
V Stiviano: Segregation. Whites and black. He was brought up to believe, these beliefs in his own way. And they're ingrained in him, deep in his body and his mind. But through his actions, he's shown that he is not a racist. Through his actions, he's shown to be a very generous and kind man.

These conversations were in private. Nevertheless, they have become public. And because they did, a lot of people have been hurt by it. His wife, his children.

Barbara Walters: These things that he said to you were recorded, did you know that?

V Stiviano: Yes, I recorded them.

Barbara Walters: But how did they become public information?

V Stiviano: Someone leaked the audio, or sold the audio, or gave the audio to what I believe to be TMZ. A friend, or a so called friend of mine. I was planning on quitting working with Mr. Sterling a few months back. No one understands my pain and feelings and I was reaching out to a few of my friends. I shared an audio with them so they can empathize and sympathize my feelings, my way of being.

Barbara Walters: You are half black, and half Mexican. You were very close to Donald Sterling. You do not consider him a racist.

V Stiviano: No. People were used to Mr. Sterling being Mr. Sterling and here comes V and everything changed. Mr. Sterling is nice and kind to everyone, he greets and treats everyone with equality, and I brought that light to him.

Barbara Walters: So you helped him become a better person?

V Stiviano: In every way. In every way.

Barbara Walters: Can you tell me what your relationship with Donald Sterling is?

V Stiviano: I'm Mr. Sterling's right hand arm. Man.

Barbara Walters: Are you in love with Donald Sterling?
V Stiviano: I love him.

Barbara Walters: I'm not sure that's what I asked. Are you in love?

V Stiviano: No. I'm not in love.

Barbara Walters: You love him what, like a friend?

V Stiviano: I love him like a father figure.

Barbara Walters: Like a father. Do you and Donald Sterling have a financial arrangement, you say you're his assistant, does he pay you?

V Stiviano: Yes. At first he started paying me as an employee and then he started paying me off the books.

Barbara Walters: Is he still paying you off the books?

V Stiviano: No.

Barbara Walters: You are one of his assistants-

V Stiviano: I am his assistant.

Barbara Walters: You are his assistant. You are very honest so I'm going to be blunt as well. Donald Sterling has been married for over sixty years. Where do you fit into that life?

V Stiviano: I don't. Mr. Sterling's marriage is Mr. Sterling's marriage and relationship. I'm not part of that life.
Barbara Walters: What's the biggest misconception about you?

V Stiviano: That I'm a mistress or a whore. Or a woman of the night.

Barbara Walters: People have seen you walking with a visor. Why the visor?

V Stiviano: It hurts to see someone that you care about hurting. It hurts to see people speculate, assume, say, throw darts at you when they don't know you. When they don't know your story, when they don't know the truth all based on hearsay and assumptions it hurts.

Barbara Walters: You just left Donald Sterling, what is his state of mind right now?

V Stiviano: Confused. I think he feels very alone. Not truly supported by those around him. Tormented. Emotionally traumatized.

Barbara Walters: From what?

V Stiviano: From everything. I think he's highly more traumatized and hurt by the things he said himself. I think he can't even believe or understand sometimes the things he says.

Barbara Walters: Do you think that Donald Sterling should apologize?

V Stiviano: Absolutely.

Barbara Walters: Will he apologize?

V Stiviano: Only God knows.

Barbara Walters: What advice are you giving Donald Sterling now?

V Stiviano: I just want him to come to his senses. I want him to believe it and feel it and to generally feel apologetic to the world. I'm giving him the advice that he should apologize to the nation, to the world, for his racist remarks.",misc

But I been there look like any strip club
Everybody slicked up trying to get they dick sucked
Smoke and mirrors, you know fake magic tricks
Like these people didn't come here just for ass and tits
But this one in particular was popular with midlife ballers
And white collar out of towners
Plus it attracted athletic individuals that came here to play against
The twins and the timber wolves
Safe to say she made the rent good
Twenty years of age a spot up in Kentwood
She had the car, the dog, and the kitchen sink
She had a drug-free body didn't even drink
She had a sister who wouldn't stop giving her shit
For dropping out of art school to be a stripper
Iris was sick and tired of the questions
But big sis didn't understand the perspective
She knows her little sister isn't a slut
But she objectifies herself and contributes to the gluttony
Now here's Iris stealin' from the devil to buy some time
To make life something special

Awfully slim, on a diet of bottled water and oxygen
She lives on Hiawatha by the Target

Or maybe LA or NY
Now she does what she does here and she gets by
And her boyfriend gets a little currency
Taking photos for advertising agencies
Now he's gonna steal from the devil
Stick it to the man, revolutionary rebel
One afternoon after work he went to the strip club
Just to loosen up that shirt
He and a couple job associates are gonna sink them drinks
Like they about to be extinct
Never met his girlfriends little sister
But she recognized him from cell phone pictures
Any other circumstances she'd have hollered
But topless in heels is a little bit awkward
Eventually his friends leave
And when he gets up, she grabs him by the coat sleeve
Too drunk to catch what she says
But he did offer her three hundred on some head, like

There was a boy I met in kindergarten
He was sweet, he said that I was smart
He was good at sports and people liked him
And at nap time once we shared a mat
I didn't sleep I sat and watched him breathing
Watched him dream for nearly half an hour
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Then he woke up
 
He pulled a scab off one time playing kick ball
Kissed me quick then pressed it in my hand
I took that scab and put it in a locket
All year long I wore it near my heart
He didn't care if I was thin or pretty
And he was mine until we hit first grade
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Then he woke up
 
Last night I dreamed a horse with wings
Flew down into my homeroom
On its back there he sat
And he held out his arms
So we sailed above the gym
Across the faculty parking lot
My kindergarten boyfriend and I
And a horse with wings
 
Now we're all grown up and we know better
Now we recognize the way things are
Certain boys are just for kindergarten
Certain girls are meant to be alone
But I believe that any dream worth having
Is a dream that should not have to end
So I'll build a dream that I can live in
And this time I'm never waking up
 
And we'll soar above the trees
Over cars and croquet lawns
Past the church and the lake

Big bag of blues and they can't fold
Drip on my shoes and you straight froze

You wouldn't handle the pressure
Gotta be careful on these songs 'cause they might use it against me

Kiss of vanity the soft and the black and the
Velvety up tight against the side of me and
Mouth and eyes and heart all bleed and run in
Thickening streams of greed as bit by bit it
Starts the need to just let go my party piece

Oh i miss the kiss of treachery the aching kiss
Before i feed the stench of a love for a younger
Meat and the sound that it makes when it cuts
In deep the holding up on bended knees the
Addiction of duplicities as bit by bit it starts
The need to just let go my party piece

But i never said i would stay to the end so i
Leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over i leave
You with photographs pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both us knew how the ending would
Be...
So it's all come back round to breaking apart
Again breaking apart like i'm made up of glass
Again making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again cut in deep
To the heart of the bone again round and round
And round and it's coming apart again over and
Over and over

Now that i know that i'm breaking to pieces i'll
Pull out my heart and i'll feed it to anyone
Crying for sympathy crocodile cry for the love
Of the crowd and the three cheers from
Everyone dropping through sky through the
Glass of the roof through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye through the eye
Of the needle it's easier for me to get closer to
Heaven than ever feel whole again

I never said i would stay to the end i knew i
Would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming me over and over and over i leave

Happiness murmured in dreams when we both

I saw you crying
I know you’re tried to hold it down
You’re tied of trying
Stay with me for life

3243,"I'm searching to find what's beyond each horizon
To the end of one world and on to a new one
Always chasing golden sunsets
I'm struggling out of the depths of the valley
And my weary legs have failed me once again
So I give my broken soul to you

And in my weakness is Your strength realized
Consume me in the fire of Your glory once again
And help me rise

Rise, taking flight
To the zenith of life
Rise to the top of the mountain with You
The world disappears
Into the valley below me
As I'm lost in the glory of You

Step by step the climb gets harder
My being weakens as I struggle farther and farther
Flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness
My dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled
My will defeated, my spirit humbled once more
I am hopeless, helpless without you
And I must decrease so that You may increase
And when I find you're all I have
I found you're all I need to help me rise

Rise, taking flight
To the zenith of life
Rise to the top of the mountain with You
The world disappears
Into the valley below me
As I'm lost in the glory of You

I cannot fight this battle on my own
Have mercy
I'm fallen weakness clothed in flesh and bone
Consume me
I stand in awe of who you are
And what I feel I cannot explain
Forged in the flame, broken again

Take me to the places I can't go
Transcending
I'm sick of living in the status quo

And when it seems I've given up
On eagle' wings you life me up again

22 years old, set my stride
Out on that hardened up road, was my life
I was bound

Late night in the hen house, met this girl
My Cadillac was full of gold, her name was May Pearl
And she turned me on

She had another man unbeknownst to me
Met me at the back door, he had a switchblade up his sleeve
Startin' trouble, y'all

Well, unbeknownst to him was May Pearl
She filled his head with six rounds of lead
Laid his tired ass on the floor
Now I'm on the run, y'all
Well, well
I'm in the hot house breakin' stones, y'all

New Orleans, 'bout a year ago
Five-O run a dice game, got me slippin' out the window
Down the alley I run, hound dog on my trail

When I was playing Sunday league over Blackshots field
I saw her on the football pitch, she was all in black
Her slight was slightly baggy but her shorts were up her crack
I had more shots than Frank Lampard in an attempt to turn her head
But like when he's in an England shirt, they all landed in row Z
I hoped that my firm tackle and my ball control
Would make me look a good acquisition and I'd get to achieve my goal

Make your decision final
Please go out with me

But I think you hold the key
I got a yellow card when my cock went hard
Over the female referee

As I ate my half-time oranges and rolled down my socks
I thought that I might turn her on if I dribbled round the box
My team was losing eleven-nil but then I got a chance
I scored a toe-poke from three yards and did a Roger Miller dance
My ethnic moves must have caught her eye because at full-time
She asked me if I'd take her out for a lager and lime
We were getting on really well, it was all going alright
Until I ran over a disabled kid when I jumped a yellow light
Female referee, female referee
It was just an error in judgement
Don't finish with me

Demons on a drip
Devil’s in my iv
Bloodstream feeding me evil
Feeble-minded
Thinking that the world VR!
Wishing I could see far!
Up and outta this mess
Yeah
Wanna feel blessed
Puffing dragons outta my chest
Can’t do nothing right regardless
Thought this was rhyming was harmless
Nothing alarming
About a fatherless child kicking flow
Well, I pick my nose
Alone on the yellow bus
Watching the outside fade by
Wade high
Mellowed off the cigarillo
I use to escape time
Wristwatch killer
Like stabbing a Rolex
Out of shape
Must’ve broke the bow-flex

Pop caps in my grave
Gonna have to kill my ghost
To kill my soul
Nights over a toilet bowl
Puking & vomit
Illustrious as Haley’s comet
Feeling like a slow ass Sonic
Gold rings flying all angles
Perfect symmetry dangles
We all co-exist mangled
In the petri dish
Bacteria, grew some legs
Up & out the fish
Water to land
God’s plan or planned matrix?
Have you wondering
How one could possibly fake this?
Have you wondering
How one could possibly fake this?
Have you wondering

Rock a fleece & sweater vest

Of a blue earth
Destroying the balance of a system in place

Lay hidden inside
Bodies left plunging
A black hell awaiting

High sense of rhythm, you can call me Rockness
Monster in the river, got the game on lock-twist
First I got the crew, split in two, then we spread out
Popping up on me abruptly gon' force me to pull lead out
Till we run into a fire breathing dragon saying ""Get out""
So we make like Ace Ventura driving, we head out
""Oh God, CiNo dropped? I hope not
He gon' steal my fans and dough before I blow, pop
Maybe I should say that I tote Glocks and smoke pot
Like he does"", you motherfucker don't get that it won't stop?
I'm the Flow God and the lyrical one
Hear my words spun on lyrics, it's spiritual fun
I mirror some of the great ones, you are fake, son!
I don't give a fuck if you blaze one, your day's done
I'm A1, bitch, this is an invasion
Like aliens, I handle the game, no PlayStation
Zooming in on foes like shooting a ray gun
You humans are just toast, the puniest bread crumbs
I don't gamble, but if you got my money, I say ""Bet that""
Let's rap, I want to work with Slim when I'm less fat
I won't stress that cuz Rap is what I'm best at
I'll make a mess if you mess with me, try to test that
Critics saying I shouldn't say the word ""Nigga""
But I'm part-Egyptian, so what you saying, lil nigga?
So, just cuz I say it, you saying I'm not a lyricist?
So you disregarding Nas, Ludacris, 50 Cent?
Busta Rhymes, Lupe Fiasco, nigga, Jadakiss!?
I shouldn't pay attention to you lame kids on the internet
I been a vet, a young OG, fabulous intellect
Matter of fact, get back 'fore you get in a wreck
I'm finna get you to your death in a millisecond
Still you begging to get killed, I just brought your will to Heaven
You should go and see reverend, how I got you dreaming hectic

Dot used to call me so much I use to turn my cell off, damn
I think I'm the reason why we fell off
We used to ride our bikes he never laughed when I fell off
Saturdays we watchin' cartoons and eatin' Kelloggs
Damn I just dwelled off
Thinkin' 'bout the trips to Plymouth Meeting on the L Dawg
Or think about the 22 bus to Willow Grove when we wanted Aeropostale dawg
Straight to Foot Locker for them 2 for 80 shells dawg
Now act like you remember
Remember all the times ain't had no jackets in the winter
Remember I would ask the lunch lady for some seconds just to pack it for my dinner
Me and Jamie eatin' Slim Jims and crackers for our dinner, nigga
Jeff remember all the shit you gave me
I could never pay you back, it's like you fuckin raised me
My mom got so high one night she tried to rape me
Never hold it against her she prolly don't remember
Hey Phil Do you remember our first cup Shit
We was floatin' on water like were part of a surf club
And Bree was my first love
She let so somethin' small come between us and left like she ain't been through the worst stuff
And 'Kees still stressed bout this work stuff
I get a deal he'll never have to work again never have to hurt again
Never have to got to ASICS, sell another shirt again
Told him get back on his shit cause he deserve to win
Tryna get my shit straight movin' on to bigger plans
Life's too short for the grudges I be the bigger man
But I ain't fuckin wit these niggas man
I rather see my niggas dead than see em in the can
I just wanna give em more than a lot
I'm laid up wit a bitch while I think about Tum
I know he thinkin' 'bout me as he lay in his Cot, damn
I hope my uncle saved me a spot
What if me and Lil never met
In my life, I should've never took several steps
Better yet I would've been at this expensive college
Fucked up tryna pay em off a heavy debt, what you expect
Me and Reem got close so we laughed more
I told him 'bout my life and how I use to be past poor
He told me 'bout his he said he had the shit that he asked for
But somehow we just went straight to the back door
Duckin' the task force my sister is the reason I rap more
Tryna get my mother a Jag or
A Rolls Royce wasn't tryna get her a Rav4
Or buy her a Celica I grew up sellin' stuff damn
Only 12 when I came off the porch
I ain't wanna sell drugs I was forced damn
My aunt love to show me off of course

See I'm rapping with a purpose I slash you when I burst this
Herds of verbal curses don't try to step up mic I'll snatch your soul like purses
I elevate like the taxes and levitate off the mattress
That's why I'm labeled a savage you see my tablets are madness
Yo I spray 16s like you put an m in front of it
Treat your rhymes like burlap cuz they ain't worth nothing kid
With a single breath till the death I'll be in effect
Dropping rhymes that disconnect simple threats on the premises
Feel demonic but my people say I'm heaven sent
When I get up on the mic y'all know that I represent
Yo my mind goes in grind mode I ignite foes and write flows
I spit verse And rip the time folds
So cold it's like your underground tryna mine gold
Keep it cleaner then some motherfucking pinesole,,
Yo check the rap that I speak I'm crafting avid techniques
These thoughts will shatter your spleen your on the path of the beast
But I'm purging all these maggots when a tablet's released
You'll get smacked in the streets or probably stabbed through the fleece,,
I feed your mind with my lines so my words are nutritious
They get served on some dishes from start to the finish
I'll be launching these rhythms straight up bomb your position
My brains sharper then switches just watch me slaughter my victims,,
I know my times coming fate is slowly closing in
Focusing man this life's a game I'm hoping I can win

And y’all been sleeping on the rhythms I’m reading
So feel what I’m feeling and dream what I’m dreaming
Sorry I’m leaving but believe what I believe in
And you’ll see why I gotta be
On my way
I’ve been working everyday just to be
On my way
But I swear one day that I’ll be back
There’s just one thing I gotta ask
Where the party at, Where the party at?
I’ve been rapping all day so holler back

[Hook]

It’s all good tonight
I couldn’t ask for a better life
It’s a good life
I couldn’t ask for a better night

You gotta celebrate when you’ve come this far
Barrio to the Bronx to a super star

[Verse 3]

This might be my last night paradise but I’ll be fine
I know you’ll be alright so dry your eyes
Don’t be sad it’s over just be glad it happened
If they ask me, I hope you’re happy
Party tonight? yeah, I would gladly
Life is good, never say otherwise
Let’s have a good night cause tomorrow it’s goodbye

[Hook]

It’s all good tonight
I couldn’t ask for a better life
It’s a good life
I couldn’t ask for a better night

Well, here we are again
You already know who I am, and you know what I do
So without further ado, I give to you..
Half Breed Bad Seed

[Verse 1: KJD]
KJD, established in '92
Yeah, the same fucking year they established the mighty Wu
On the scavenger hunt for fame, I asked for the final clue
You won't make it before me. I ain't having it, I refuse
Nobody is surpassing the passion that I exude
You don't really wanna battle, I'll smash your entire crew
Let the world behold the Clash of the Titans 2
And watch you fall to your knees. I'll be laughing right as you do
Uh. Rap is a sacrifice, for which, I've wasted half my life
At least, that's what they tell me whenever I ask advice
But nah, that won't suffice. Feel like I'm becoming your personal prisoner
Spitting my problems and making it entertaining for the ears of the listener
Respect the choices that I've made, lyrical prowess I've displayed
The emotional connection, and the outlet of my rage
Countless number of days, none in which have I so proven my worthiness
But I'm stressed to say, most of you suck, and that's being courteous
Not just my opinion, but that of which of millions more
You might get sickened by the premonition that's envisioned. Furthermore
I'm the hip hop connoisseur, This is just a sample
Of the damage I'll be doing, and I promise more
[Interlude]
Half Breed Bad Seed represents, everything
The pain, the joy. The hatred, the laughter
You will hear stories of tragedy, stories of perseverance
Most of all, you get my story

[Verse 2: KJD]
Back again to make rappers sick to their stomach
We're all just crabs in a bucket, with plans of reaching the summit
You're asking them why they love it, and cash is what they come up with
So, I'm taking the game, and playing ""keep away"". So you fad followers, you can't get nothing
Since '92, I've been a finely tuned machine
That makes these rhyming dudes envy. It's not surprising who it be
Cuz I'm a timeless true emcee. The eleventh hour has come
Should we stay, or cut our losses? Defend what's ours, or run?
Condemn the powers with guns, or send them flowers with love?
Imma' fight till the blackest hole devours the sun
I'm on a different channel than all of these rappers with no passion
Back to your regularly scheduled programming",rap
6189,"[Verse 1]
Drank a lot of coffee today
Got lost in the fray, I gave all I had for a time
Then by some strange design, I got a case of the empties
The ruler of my world, a lost forgotten pearl
When fire leaves a girl
Too burned to try my life
Living on the fault line
And at night

[Chorus]
I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me
Something to believe

[Bridge]
Didn't always do it right
Might've left the heat on high
Didn't know I had any left
Thought I finally met my death
Gonna do all I can
To stay away from the quicksand
Gonna do all I can
[Verse 2]
Nobody's gonna love you the same way
Some of us go astray, I walked so far from them all
Instead of dropping the ball, I seem to carry so many
The colors don't align, a question of time
I seem to lose what I find
Please give me a sign soon
Really wanna find out the truth
And at night

[Chorus]
I just lay down and cry
The waters don't really go by me
Give me something I can see
Something bigger and louder than the voices in me
Something to believe, to believe
Something to believe
Something to believe

I'm launchin' rockets and SCUDs at Crockett and Tubbs
[And Tye] full of more Rum than a [Mai-Tai] again despite high
Schoolin', I be high refusin' to listen to what the PTA say
Eff a four point oh GPA I got a five point oh GTA
Hittin' the chop shop, with an ETA of 3 o'clock, so shake the spot
Like Luke and them girls with the Daisy Dukes
'Cause life's a beach and I forever be wearin' my bathin' suit
Met this Colombian mami, said her daddy trafficked cavi
With government permission, no DEA intervention
Filthy rich and did lines for recreation snortin' coke up
But Pinoche's rollin', 'cause I don't know the next ho be the loc'est

Now how many toasters can these smokers keep pawning? (hehe..)
My school days was like Porky's
In class doin' the butt, or in the hallway ditchin'
Teacher's pet snitchin', but ain't no Miami Bass like the triple beam
So fool please, I move MC's like OZ's
I want more cheese than Kraft Ravioli
Got love like Chachi and Joni microphone Michael Corleone
Only the homies really know me, but everybody
Want to dip in my Mixelplic [what part of the game is this?]
Keepin' CoInTelPro stickin' it to brothers like Velcro
Fightin' felony convictions, a closer shave than Norelco
Well though, stay and lose it, I'm still official

Accept no Substitute
And I'mma make it known, The Specialist like Stallone
And Sharon Stone watchin' your spot get blown
You don't even understand, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers

What the world needs is less free cheese
More white collar J-O-B's, these ghetto MP's
Stretchin' fools on the block for crack rock
But powder power brokers is gettin' over like unprotected sex with Oprah
Float, like a Tournament of Roses parade
Sting, like a bee, but of course
I put my foot so deep in yo ass
The water in my knee will quench your thirst, I got juice freshly squeezed
Words 100 percent bom-Bay, made from more concentration than Minute Maid
Renegade rhyme ride ruckus non-fiction me and my kin
Slippin' mickies and puttin' hickies on your chest

Still asleep when it begins

White noise keeps
The crowds at bay
From turning calm
To disarray

Velvet gloves
And silver tongues
Steal the world

Draw the curtain
Say good night
It all begins
At first light
Pull the trigger
While you can
And fall asleep
An honest man

Tumbling back to earth again
The worse of it so softly spoken
Still asleep when it begins

In a whispered moan:

""The dead man was limp
When laid in his chest;
Yea, limp; and why
But to signify
That the grave will crimp
Ere next year's sun
Yet another one
Of those in that house -
It may be the best -
For its endless drowse!""

Said the brown-shawled dame
To confirm the same:

""And the slothful flies
On the rotting fruit
Have been seen to wear
While crawling there
Crape scarves, by eyes
That were quick and acute;
As did those that had pitched
On the cows by the pails,
And with flaps of their tails
Were far away switched.""
Said the third in plaid,
Each word being weighed:

""And trotting does
In the park, in the lane,
And just outside
The shuttered pane,
Have also been heard -
Quick feet as light
As the feet of a sprite -
And the wise mind knows
What things may betide
When such has occurred.""

Cold faced as the north:

""O, though giving such
Some head-room, I smile
At your falterings
When noting those things
Round your domicile!
For what, what can touch
One whom, riven of all
That makes life gay,
No hints can appal
Of more takings away!""",misc

Down to Nice and Cannes
And you could drive too fast until the police started chasing you;
Chasing you through an old town square
And up onto the pavements;
Past all the people sitting outside the cafes
And round and round the fountain;
Through an old market crashing into the fish stalls and the stands of fruit
'Til you finally shook them off and escaped
And in a car like that, when you got to Antibes
You could drive about on the sand, spraying up the waves
And you could forget all about what year it really was
And all about the place you had come from

Everyone seems disgusted by cheating — unless it’s a different form of cheating which is actually coached, encouraged, applauded and talked about as an integral part of the game.

“If you ain’t cheatin,’ you ain’t tryin’,” is an old adage in sports which some attribute to the great Richard Petty, a man so revered he is nicknamed ‘The King.’ That statement alone fuels an ongoing permissive attitude on cheating in sports, as long as it’s not steroids.

“Cheating refers to an immoral way of achieving a goal, generally used to... gain advantage in a competitive situation,” wrote Justin Caouette, a PhD student at the University of Calgary’s philosophy department. With that as a backdrop...

When an offensive lineman obviously holds a defensive player during a passing play, which is against the rules, and doesn’t get caught, the announcers inevitably say, “It’s not holding if you don’t get caught!” And then chuckle together as if they invented the line, which I’m pretty sure was used by Ronald Reagan when he was doing play-by-play radio broadcasts before his acting and political careers respectively.

Or an act so egregious as taping the opponent’s practice sessions in pro football to help your team win the Super Bowl three times and the consequence is to be labeled a genius (who knew Thomas Edison had so much competition as a genius simply in the sports arena?).

A basketball player flopping to draw a foul is cheating to gain an advantage. They are clearly fooling the official into making the wrong call, which can impact the outcome of a game. That’s cheating. However, the announcers always applaud the play and label the player “smart” and add a hacky line about the player winning an Academy Award for their performance (as an aside: can these uncreative, fossilized, play-by-play analysts please update who to use as an example of great acting... someone besides Laurence Olivier?).

Flopping is reaching soccer-like levels (that is another level of cheating all-together) which compelled the NBA to announce a new anti-flopping rule recently that begins with a warning and moves quickly to major fines. Good for the game right? However, the NBA Players Association is not happy from a collective-bargaining standpoint and is set to file a grievance with the league.

Youth coaches have admitted to teaching young players how to flop and hold to gain an advantage and fool the officials. This behavior is accepted for some reason but when someone mentions steroids, especially in baseball, there was more outrage from Congress, the press and general public than I remember over genocide in Rwanda. Since we’re on the subject of baseball, let’s take a look at how they have handled cheating prior to last week’s excommunication of steroid users.

The Hall of Fame is littered with plucky managers who stole signs as part of their strategy such as Hall of Fame player-manager Rogers Hornsby who actually wrote an article title “You’ve Got to Cheat to Win.” Corked bats and scuffed balls have been tools to get into the Hall. And let’s not forget admitted spit-baller Gaylord Perry who won 314 times and struck out over 3,500 batters yet was welcomed into the Hall of Fame to mass winking and even had the temerity to write, “I became an outlaw in the strictest sense of the word — a man who lives outside the law, in this case the law of baseball.” Perry isn’t Christy Mathewson who threw the spitball over century ago before it was made illegal. Most give Mathewson a pass since the spitball wasn’t illegal in his day.

Timing is also interesting in the steroid era. Admitted steroider Mark McGwire admitted to using androstenedione after famously playing dodgeball during a Congressional hearing. Andro was legal and sold over the counter when he used it. Yet he is being denied entry into the Hall of Fame. Others, like Bonds, Clemens and even Mike Piazza who was the greatest hitting catcher of all time is being kept out simply for playing during the steroid era. Bad actors don’t deserve great stages, but baseball and sports overall needs to be consistent.

Steroids will keep players out but all is forgiven when locker rooms in the ‘60s provided greenies, bennies, black beauties and other forms of amphetamines the way dressing rooms provided M & M’s (sans brown) to Van Halen in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Jim Bouton’s seminal book Ball Four named Hall of Famers and their need for stimulants to get through a long, hot season. “Amphetamines have been around the game forever,” said Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt in his book Clearing the Bases. When Major League Baseball finally chose to act against amphetamines in 2006, past players must have chortled since they popped pills with impunity. And now there’s an Adderall-usage issue for players who gain an advantage by being able to better focus during all the distractions of a season and a game. Yes, the same ADHD medicine kids are prescribed after extensive examinations to be able function in classrooms.
Since I mentioned kids, what are we telling young people about cheating? Are we saying that the act of cheating depends on how it’s defined or accepted by authority? That cheating depends on how it’s perceived? I’m a firm believer that what we learn as kids with sports manifests itself into other areas of life from traffic violations to financial malfeasance which will land someone in prison and not simply being kept out of the Hall of Fame.

My role model Dr. Pedro Jose Greer once told me that “Integrity is what you do when no one is looking.” In sports, many players actually have EVERYONE looking at them and with slow-motion replay available and continue to cheat at every turn.",misc

A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it
We make extraordinary efforts to delay it

7872,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" said his lady to him one day, ""have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?""

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

""But it is,"" returned she; ""for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.""

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

""Do you not want to know who has taken it?"" cried his wife impatiently.

""You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.""

This was invitation enough.

""Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.""

""What is his name?""
""Bingley.""

""Is he married or single?""

""Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!""

""How so? How can it affect them?""

""My dear Mr. Bennet,"" replied his wife, ""how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.""

""Is that his design in settling here?""

""Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.""

""I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.""

""My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.""

""In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.""

""But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.""

""It is more than I engage for, I assure you.""

""But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.""
""You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.""

""I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving her the preference.""

""They have none of them much to recommend them,"" replied he; ""they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.""

""Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.""

""You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.""

""Ah, you do not know what I suffer.""

""But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.""

""It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.""

""Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.""

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",misc

In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

And when they came to Bethlehem
Where our dear Saviour lay
They found Him in a manger
Where oxen feed on hay
His Mother Mary kneeling down
Unto the Lord did pray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine

Until the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal

Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day...
(Ha ha, no laughing during this song please... It's being recorded, I know. Hell, don't you know it's being recorded?)
...Like a friend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine

And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double, pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Back and forth I rock when theres no beat
They say my minds gone, I snapped can it really be?
I try to think back to the day you walked away
But all I see is blank space, lost in my brain

I guess I'm getting used to being on my own
I got my fingers in an x behind my back they are permanently sown
What can I ever be? How can I ever change?
How can I be the man when I can't even stand -
The sight of my face, I'm isolated from the world I'm a disgrace, man thats what they say

And after all these years I finally gave in
I'm not the type of guy that needs your saving
Cuz I made it while you was dating
And all that hating - it ain't shit

I'm fine with being on my own
I'm finally fine with being all alone

I need the weed, the crack runs me back to my habits
I never go to my crib empty handed
Branded with these drugs in my lungs I've about had enough
Cram this stuff in the bowl and take another fucking puff
I'm running my soul, fronting a pro
Jacked like I'm fucking a hole, I'm cumming in bowls
I don't know how this will close
I'm shunning my goals
I'd rather have another hit to the last hit, gulping a roach
I'm a leave it, I feel the need to - until I need to have some more
I don't think I'll ever see this through
Do you believe in me?  I don't believe you

Admit it the first thought you had was that this creep is screwed
And maybe you're right, cuz till the end I'll have my pipe and wrench the drugs out of your twitching carcass
I'm too far from bliss
You'll leak with blood, and when I'm done you will cease to exist

A rose, no thorns, struggling to hold on
Picked clean of it's strength thinking it ain't worth one
Second glance or a look from heart-broken sunken-eyed girl in a wolf's disguise, piercing eyes
Preying teeth, stalking quietly
She ain't seen it coming, losing nothing
Everything sunken under a million other people going through the same thing or worse
She's hurt
No home
Just dirt
Long gone
Faded memories ride the coattails
Closed curtains to a past life
New act, new mind
New friends, new life
No time machine in sight
No second try gotta make it count
Cuz if I lose it all again I won't make it out

We're the age on a stage on a minimum wage
With the wages sniffed, the payments missed
Another payday loan, received and blown
To a place unknown

And it's fine by me
There's a world outside, I can see it through my screen
What a sight to see
What a time to be

Vivo
I don't wanna go outside no more
Vivo
Why would we, when we could be alone?
Vivo
I don't wanna go outside no more
Vivo
Why would we?

Vivo, I don't wanna go outside no more

From which they’ll never waken
Their world is an apple on a tree
Just waiting to be shaken

And only the young
Don’t care what tomorrow may bring
Today is a merry-go-round
With a big, brass ring

We both can stay young as a morning in May
A warm and sunny green time
I’ll hold you and love you every day
They’ll be no in between time

Though years may go by
We’ll look at each other and see
The love lighted faces of only the young

Turned my world upside down
When I first laid my eyes on you
This feeling's really frightening
'cause it seems to me I've found
The perfect man of all for me to choose
Used to dream of such a man like you
Never thought it would come true
Boy you are the answer to my prayers

I never felt like this before and
You have opened up the door
Into a space that I would never dare

'cause you give my life a meaning
And this love we have together
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
I was searching, seeking, finding
Love came out from it's hiding
And baby, I'm so pleased at what I found
The way you seem to be, the only one for me
This love is truly special, we're 2 of a kind
I've got you on my mind, we're 2 of a kind

This heart of mine is beating inside my chest
And baby, it's you that I adore
The nights we spend together are by far the best
That any woman could be wishing for
We're lucky baby it's like that
This ain't no opposites atract
You make up for all the bad in me

So when days of trouble come around
You know I'd never let you down
Right by your side is where I want to be

'cause you give my life a meaning
And this love we have together
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground
I was searching, seeking, finding
Love came out from it's hiding

And the world goes 'round, but the hood keeps standin' still

Ay, last night I forgot to pray
And by the time that I did, I waited so long
I damn near forgot what I got to say
I wonder how many blessings I got today? (huh!)
I don't appreciate 'em all on a daily basis
Dinner's on the table, but I ain't sayin' graces (amen)

Or thinkin' 'bout the vacation I just made to Vegas
A homeless man is walking back and forth, makin' paces
I never thought about... me and him tradin' places (huh?)
I never thought about his house or how he make his payments (nah)
I looked at him and I just thought about stayin' famous (damn)
I'm lost in all the memories that every day erases

Gone, tryna find my way from A to Z

7397,"We know what they say about sticks and stones, and the word comparing me to a bundle of sticks that should never hurt me.  The word that is shouted at me by men from behind the coward’s shield of two tons of steel riding four wheels, making damn sure I know I’m not welcome in their neighborhood.  The word high school boys hung over my head to keep me from striding too pridefully down their hallways as if gays were welcome in their realm.  The word… that I just shouldn’t let bother me so much.

But words are not impotent things.  The same power in your favorite song whose lyrics move you to tears, the power that made your high school love letters more than just letters on the page, the power of your favorite novel to pull you to the edge of your chair with no rope or wind, is the same power that can break more than just my bones.  Sticks and stones sit and moan that they can’t break a person as entirely as words can.  Stones and sticks can miss their mark, but a man need not worry about aim or proximity when he can throw the word “faggot” at me.  He can’t miss when he throws that stone.

And my fellow gays would throw this stone at me as if they were hurling harmless glitter to celebrate our commonality.  And should I raise my arms to defend myself from the assault, I’m assured it’s alright because, “We’re taking it back!”  Well I don’t want it back!  What we’re taking back the battle cry of our own destruction, the rallying call of those who would happily see us wiped from their precious country.  It cannot be taken back like stealing from the undeserving rich to give to the poor little queers downtrodden by their circumstances.

When you conjure syllables that call back to discrimination, you are not firing blanks.  The word “faggot” is the warning shot that precedes the shots riddling the bodies of gay folks with hatred made metal penetrating their flesh.  Maybe it’s the kind of hatred that packs pistols and looks for queers to kill, or maybe it’s the hatred they harbor in their own hearts for having to fear those killers their whole life.  But either way, I refuse to wear the shell casings of the bullets that fell these gay men as accessories.",misc

Without hope but soaked with pain
Consequences of reality felt

On the bridges, tent villages

What becomes of our demonstrations?
To which fate have these gatherings fell?
Which walls echo all the chants we yelled
Into faces on the coins we
Tossed into the wishing well?
Drinking water on which we subsist
Mixing into rivers that did not exist
Yesterday when all the warning
Signs were there but sorely missed
What's it worth all the money we made
Floating idly in a newborn lake?
Far above financial centers
Cities sink like market rates

As every kiss and callus that sits above my teeth and bones
Starts spitefully reprieving

Over the ground its holding
Dead on the sidelines

Too far and fast to make it up
So don't wake me over this disaster

7272,"It was pleasant for Dr. Watson to find himself once more in the untidy room of the first floor in Baker Street which had been the starting-point of so many remarkable adventures. He looked round him at the scientific charts upon the wall, the acid-charred bench of chemicals, the violin-case leaning in the corner, the coal-scuttle, which contained of old the pipes and tobacco. Finally, his eyes came round to the fresh and smiling face of Billy, the young but very wise and tactful page, who had helpеd a little to fill up the gap of lonelinеss and isolation which surrounded the saturnine figure of the great detective.

""It all seems very unchanged, Billy. You don't change, either. I hope the same can be said of him?""

Billy glanced with some solicitude at the closed door of the bedroom.

""I think he's in bed and asleep,"" he said.

It was seven in the evening of a lovely summer's day, but Dr. Watson was sufficiently familiar with the irregularity of his old friend's hours to feel no surprise at the idea.

""That means a case, I suppose?""

""Yes, sir, he is very hard at it just now. I'm frightened for his health. He gets paler and thinner, and he eats nothing. 'When will you be pleased to dine, Mr. Holmes?' Mrs. Hudson asked. 'Seven-thirty, the day after to-morrow,' said he. You know his way when he is keen on a case.""

""Yes, Billy, I know.""

""He's following someone. Yesterday he was out as a workman looking for a job. To-day he was an old woman. Fairly took me in, he did, and I ought to know his ways by now."" Billy pointed with a grin to a very baggy parasol which leaned against the sofa. ""That's part of the old woman's outfit,"" he said.

""But what is it all about, Billy?""

Billy sank his voice, as one who discusses great secrets of State. ""I don't mind telling you, sir, but it should go no farther. It's this case of the Crown diamond.""
""What -- the hundred-thousand-pound burglary?""

""Yes, sir. They must get it back, sir. Why, we had the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary both sitting on that very sofa. Mr. Holmes was very nice to them. He soon put them at their ease and promised he would do all he could. Then there is Lord Cantlemere --""

""Ah!""

""Yes, sir, you know what that means. He's a stiff'un, sir, if I may say so. I can get along with the Prime Minister, and I've nothing against the Home Secretary, who seemed a civil, obliging sort of man, but I can't stand his Lordship. Neither can Mr. Holmes, sir. You see, he don't believe in Mr. Holmes and he was against employing him. He'd rather he failed.""

""And Mr. Holmes knows it?""

""Mr. Holmes always knows whatever there is to know.""

""Well, we'll hope he won't fail and that Lord Cantlemere will be confounded. But I say, Billy, what is that curtain for across the window?""

""Mr. Holmes had it put up there three days ago. We've got something funny behind it.""

Billy advanced and drew away the drapery which screened the alcove of the bow window.

Dr. Watson could not restrain a cry of amazement. There was a facsimile of his old friend, dressing-gown and all, the face turned three-quarters towards the window and downward, as though reading an invisible book, while the body was sunk deep in an armchair. Billy detached the head and held it in the air.

""We put it at different angles, so that it may seem more lifelike. I wouldn't dare touch it if the blind were not down. But when it's up you can see this from across the way.""

""We used something of the sort once before.""

""Before my time,"" said Billy. He drew the window curtains apart and looked out into the street. ""There are folk who watch us from over yonder. I can see a fellow now at the window. Have a look for yourself.""
Watson had taken a step forward when the bedroom door opened, and the long, thin form of Holmes emerged, his face pale and drawn, but his step and bearing as active as ever. With a single spring he was at the window, and had drawn the blind once more.

""That will do, Billy,"" said he. ""You were in danger of your life then, my boy, and I can't do without you just yet. Well, Watson, it is good to see you in your old quarters once again. You come at a critical moment.""

""So I gather.""

""You can go, Billy. That boy is a problem, Watson. How far am I justified in allowing him to be in danger?""

""Danger of what, Holmes?""

""Of sudden death. I'm expecting something this evening.""

""Expecting what?""

""To be murdered, Watson.""

""No, no, you are joking, Holmes!""

""Even my limited sense of humour could evolve a better joke than that. But we may be comfortable in the meantime, may we not? Is alcohol permitted? The gasogene and cigars are in the old place. Let me see you once more in the customary armchair. You have not, I hope, learned to despise my pipe and my lamentable tobacco? It has to take the place of food these days.""

""But why not eat?""

""Because the faculties become refined when you starve them. Why, surely, as a doctor, my dear Watson, you must admit that what your digestion gains in the way of blood supply is so much lost to the brain. I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix. Therefore, it is the brain I must consider.""

""But this danger, Holmes?""
""Ah. yes, in case it should come off, it would perhaps be as well that you should burden your memory with the name and address of the murderer. You can give it to Scotland Yard, with my love and a parting blessing. Sylvius is the name -- Count Negretto Sylvius. Write it down, man, write it down! 136 Moorside Gardens, N. W. Got it?""

Watson's honest face was twitching with anxiety. He knew only too well the immense risks taken by Holmes and was well aware that what he said was more likely to be under-statement than exaggeration. Watson was always the man of action, and he rose to the occasion.

""Count me in, Holmes. I have nothing to do for a day or two.""

""Your morals don't improve, Watson. You have added fibbing to your other vices. You bear every sign of the busy medical man, with calls on him every hour.""

""Not such important ones. But can't you have this fellow arrested?""

""Yes, Watson, I could. That's what worries him so.""

""But why don't you?""

""Because I don't know where the diamond is.""

""Ah! Billy told me -- the missing Crown jewel!""

""Yes, the great yellow Mazarin stone. I've cast my net and I have my fish. But I have not got the stone. What is the use of taking them? We can make the world a better place by laying them by the heels. But that is not what I am out for. It's the stone I want.""

""And is this Count Sylvius one of your fish?""

""Yes, and he's a shark. He bites. The other is Sam Merton the boxer. Not a bad fellow, Sam, but the Count has used him. Sam's not a shark. He is a great big silly bull-headed gudgeon. But he is flopping about in my net all the same.""

""Where is this Count Sylvius?""

""I've been at his very elbow all the morning. You've seen me as an old lady, Watson. I was never more convincing. He actually picked up my parasol for me once. 'By your leave, madame,' said he -- half-ltalian, you know, and with the Southern graces of manner when in the mood, but a devil incarnate in the other mood. Life is full of whimsical happenings, Watson.""

""It might have been tragedy.""

""Well, perhaps it might. I followed him to old Straubenzee's workshop in the Minories. Straubenzee made the air-gun -- a very pretty bit of work, as I understand, and I rather fancy it is in the opposite window at the present moment. Have you seen the dummy? Of course, Billy showed it to you. Well, it may get a bullet through its beautiful head at any moment. Ah, Billy, what is it?""

The boy had reappeared in the room with a card upon a tray. Holmes glanced at it with raised eyebrows and an amused smile.

""The man himself. I had hardly expected this. Grasp the nettle, Watson! A man of nerve. Possibly you have heard of his reputation as a shooter of big game. It would indeed be a triumphant ending to his excellent sporting record if he added me to his bag. This is a proof that he feels my toe very close behind his heel.""

""Send for the police.""

""I probably shall. But not just yet. Would you glance carefully out of the window, Watson, and see if anyone is hanging about in the street?""

Watson looked warily round the edge of the curtain.

""Yes, there is one rough fellow near the door.""

""That will be Sam Merton -- the faithful but rather fatuous Sam. Where is this gentleman, Billy?""

""In the waiting-room, sir.""

""Show him up when I ring.""

""Yes,sir.""

""If I am not in the room, show him in all the same.""

""Yes, sir.""

Watson waited until the door was closed, and then he turned earnestly to his companion.

""Look here, Holmes, this is simply impossible. This is a desperate man, who sticks at nothing. He may have come to murder you.""

""I should not be surprised.""

""I insist upon staying with you.""

""You would be horribly in the way.""

""In his way?""

""No, my dear fellow -- in my way.""

""Well, I can't possibly leave you.""

""Yes, you can, Watson. And you will, for you have never failed to play the game. I am sure you will play it to the end. This man has come for his own purpose, but he may stay for mine.""

Holmes took out his notebook and scribbled a few lines. ""Take a cab to Scotland Yard and give this to Youghal of the C. I. D. Come back with the police. The fellow's arrest will follow.""

""I'll do that with joy.""

""Before you return I may have just time enough to find out where the stone is."" He touched the bell. ""I think we will go out through the bedroom. This second exit is exceedingly useful. I rather want to see my shark without his seeing me, and I have, as you will remember, my own way of doing it.""

It was, therefore, an empty room into which Billy, a minute later, ushered Count Sylvius. The famous game-shot, sportsman, and man-about-town was a big, swarthy fellow, with a formidable dark moustache shading a cruel, thin-lipped mouth, and surmounted by a long, curved nose like the beak of an eagle. He was well dressed, but his brilliant necktie, shining pin, and glittering rings were flamboyant in their effect. As the door closed behind him he looked round him with fierce, startled eyes, like one who suspects a trap at every turn. Then he gave a violent start as he saw the impassive head and the collar of the dressing-gown which projected above the armchair in the window. At first his expression was one of pure amazement. Then the light of a horrible hope gleamed in his dark, murderous eyes. He took one more glance round to see that there were no witnesses, and then, on tiptoe, his thick stick half raised, he approached the silent figure. He was crouching for his final spring and blow when a cool, sardonic voice greeted him from the open bedroom door:

""Don't break it, Count! Don't break it!""

The assassin staggered back, amazement in his convulsed face. For an instant he half raised his loaded cane once more, as if he would turn his violence from the effigy to the original; but there was something in that steady gray eye and mocking smile which caused his hand to sink to his side.

""It's a pretty little thing,"" said Holmes, advancing towards the image. ""Tavernier, the French modeller, made it. He is as good at waxworks as your friend Straubenzee is at air-guns.""

""Air-guns, sir! What do you mean?""

""Put your hat and stick on the side-table. Thank you! Pray take a seat. Would you care to put your revolver out also? Oh, very good, if you prefer to sit upon it. Your visit is really most opportune, for I wanted badly to have a few minutes' chat with you. ""

The Count scowled, with heavy, threatening eyebrows.

""I, too, wished to have some words with you, Holmes. That is why I am here. I won't deny that I intended to assault you just now.""

Holmes swung his leg on the edge of the table.

""I rather gathered that you had some idea of the sort in your head,"" said he. ""But why these personal attentions?""

""Because you have gone out of your way to annoy me. Because you have put your creatures upon my track.""

""My creatures! I assure you no!""

""Nonsense! I have had them followed. Two can play at that game, Holmes.""

""It is a small point, Count Sylvius, but perhaps you would kindly give me my prefix when you address me. You can understand that, with my routine of work, I should find myself on familiar terms with half the rogues' gallery, and you will agree that exceptions are invidious.""

""Well, Mr. Holmes, then.""

""Excellent! But I assure you you are mistaken about my alleged agents.""

Count Sylvius laughed contemptuously.

""Other people can observe as well as you. Yesterday there was an old sporting man. To-day it was an elderly woman. They held me in view all day.""

""Really, sir, you compliment me. Old Baron Dowson said the night before he was hanged that in my case what the law had gained the stage had lost. And now you give my little impersonations your kindly praise?""

""It was you -- you yourself?""

Holmes shrugged his shoulders. ""You can see in the corner the parasol which you so politely handed to me in the Minories before you began to suspect.""

""If I had known, you might never --""

""Have seen this humble home again. I was well aware of it. We all have neglected opportunities to deplore. As it happens, you did not know, so here we are!""

The Count's knotted brows gathered more heavily over his menacing eyes. ""What you say only makes the matter worse. It was not your agents but your play-acting, busybody self! You admit that you have dogged me. Why?""

""Come now, Count. You used to shoot lions in Algeria.""

""Well?""

""But why?""

""Why? The sport -- the excitement -- the danger!""

""And, no doubt, to free the country from a pest?""

""Exactly!""

""My reasons in a nutshell!""

The Count sprang to his feet, and his hand involuntarily moved back to his hip-pocket.

""Sit down, sir, sit down! There was another, more practical, reason. I want that yellow diamond!""

Count Sylvius lay back in his chair with an evil smile.

""Upon my word!"" said he.

""You knew that I was after you for that. The real reason why you are here to-night is to find out how much I know about the matter and how far my removal is absolutely essential. Well, I should say that, from your point of view, it is absolutely essential, for I know all about it, save only one thing, which you are about to tell me.""

""Oh, indeed! And pray, what is this missing fact?""

""Where the Crown diamond now is.""

The Count looked sharply at his companion. ""Oh, you want to know that, do you? How the devil should I be able to tell you where it is?""

""You can, and you will.""

""Indeed!""

""You can't bluff me, Count Sylvius."" Holmes's eyes, as he gazed at him, contracted and lightened until they were like two menacing points of steel. ""You are absolute plate-glass. I see to the very back of your mind.""

""Then, of course, you see where the diamond is!""

Holmes clapped his hands with amusement, and then pointed a derisive finger. ""Then you do know. You have admitted it!""

""I admit nothing.""

""Now, Count, if you will be reasonable we can do business. If not, you will get hurt.""

Count Sylvius threw up his eyes to the ceiling. ""And you talk about bluff!"" said he.

Holmes looked at him thoughtfully like a master chess-player who meditates his crowning move. Then he threw open the table drawer and drew out a squat notebook.

""Do you know what I keep in this book?""

""No, sir, I do not!""

""You!""

""Me!""

""Yes, sir, you! You are all here -- every action of yor vile and dangerous life.""

""Damn you, Holmes!"" cried the Count with blazing eyes. ""There are limits to my patience!""

""It's all here, Count. The real facts as to the death of old Mrs. Harold, who left you the Blymer estate, which you so rapidly gambled away.""

""You are dreaming!""

""And the complete life history of Miss Minnie Warrender.""

""Tut! You will make nothing of that!""

""Plenty more here, Count. Here is the robbery in the train de-luxe to the Riviera on February 13, 1892. Here is the forged check in the same year on the Credit Lyonnais.""

""No, you're wrong there.""

""Then I am right on the others! Now, Count, you are a card-player. When the other fellow has all the trumps, it saves time to throw down your hand.""

""What has all this talk to do with the jewel of which you spoke?""

""Gently, Count. Restrain that eager mind! Let me get to the points in my own humdrum fashion. I have all this against you; but, above all, I have a clear case against both you and your fighting bully in the case of the Crown diamond.""

""Indeed!""

""I have the cabman who took you to Whitehall and the cabman who brought you away. I have the commissionaire who saw you near the case. I have Ikey Sanders, who refused to cut it up for you. Ikey has peached, and the game is up.""

The veins stood out on the Count's forehead. His dark, hairy hands were clenched in a convulsion of restrained emotion. He tried to speak, but the words would not shape themselves.

""That's the hand I play from,"" said Holmes. ""I put it all upon the table. But one card is missing. It's the king of diamonds. I don't know where the stone is.""

""You never shall know.""

""No? Now, be reasonable, Count. Consider the situation. You are going to be locked up for twenty years. So is Sam Merton. What good are you going to get out of your diamond? None in the world. But if you hand it over -- well, I'll compound a felony. We don't want you or Sam. We want the stone. Give that up, and so far as I am concerned you can go free so long as you behave yourself in the future. If you make another slip well, it will be the last. But this time my commission is to get the stone, not you.""

""But if I refuse?""

""Why, then -- alas! -- it must be you and not the stone.""

Billy had appeared in answer to a ring.

""I think, Count, that it would be as well to have your friend Sam at this conference. After all, his interests should be represented. Billy, you will see a large and ugly gentleman outside the front door. Ask him to come up.""

""If he won't come, sir?""

""No violence, Billy. Don't be rough with him. If you tell him that Count Sylvius wants him he will certainly come.""

""What are you going to do now?"" asked the Count as Billy disappeared.

""My friend Watson was with me just now. I told him that I had a shark and a gudgeon in my net; now I am drawing the net and up they come together.""

The Count had risen from his chair, and his hand was behind his back. Holmes held something half protruding from the pocket of his dressing-gown.

""You won't die in your bed, Holmes.""

""I have often had the same idea. Does it matter very much? After all, Count, your own exit is more likely to be perpendicular than horizontal. But these anticipations of the future are morbid. Why not give ourselves up to the unrestrained enjoyment of the present?""

A sudden wild-beast light sprang up in the dark, menacing eyes of the master criminal. Holmes's figure seemed to grow taller as he grew tense and ready.

""It is no use your fingering your revolver, my friend,"" he said in a quiet voice. ""You know perfectly well that you dare not use it, even if I gave you time to draw it. Nasty, noisy things, revolvers, Count. Better stick to air-guns. Ah! I think I hear the fairy footstep of your estimable partner. Good day, Mr. Merton. Rather dull in the street, is it not?""

The prize-fighter, a heavily built young man with a stupid, obstinate, slab-sided face, stood awkwardly at the door, looking about him with a puzzled expression. Holmes's debonair manner was a new experience, and though he vaguely felt that it was hostile, he did not know how to counter it. He turned to his more astute comrade for help.

""What's the game now, Count? What's this fellow want? What's up?"" His voice was deep and raucous.

The Count shrugged his shoulders, and it was Holmes who answered.

""If I may put it in a nutshell, Mr. Merton, I should say it was all up.""

The boxer still addressed his remarks to his associate.

""Is this cove trying to be funny, or what? I'm not in the funny mood myself.""

""No, I expect not,"" said Holmes. ""I think I can promise you that you will feel even less humorous as the evening advances. Now, look here, Count Sylvius. I'm a busy man and I can't waste time. I'm going into that bedroom. Pray make yourselves quite at home in my absence. You can explain to your friend how the matter lies without the restraint of my presence. I shall try over the Hoffman 'Barcarole' upon my violin. In five minutes I shall return for your final answer. You quite grasp the alternative, do you not? Shall we take you, or shall we have the stone?""

Holmes withdrew, picking up his violin from the corner as he passed. A few moments later the long-drawn, wailing notes of that most haunting of tunes came faintly through the closed door of the bedroom.

""What is it, then?"" asked Merton anxiously as his companion turned to him. ""Does he know about the stone?""

""He knows a damned sight too much about it. I'm not sure that he doesn't know all about it.""

""Good Lord!"" The boxer's sallow face turned a shade whiter.

""Ikey Sanders has split on us.""

""He has, has he? I'll do him down a thick 'un for that if I swing for it.""

""That won't help us much. We've got to make up our minds what to do.""

""Half a mo',"" said the boxer, looking suspiciously at the bedroom door. ""He's a leary cove that wants watching. I suppose he's not listening?""

""How can he be listening with that music going?""

""That's right. Maybe somebody's behind a curtain. Too many curtains in this room."" As he looked round he suddenly saw for the first time the effigy in the window, and stood staring and pointing, too amazed for words.

""Tut! it's only a dummy,"" said the Count.

""A fake, is it? Well, strike me! Madame Tussaud ain't in it. It's the living spit of him, gown and all. But them curtains Count!""

""Oh, confound the curtains! We are wasting our time, and there is none too much. He can lag us over this stone.""

""The deuce he can!""

""But he'll let us slip if we only tell him where the swag is.""

""What! Give it up? Give up a hundred thousand quid?""

""It's one or the other.""

Merton scratched his short-cropped pate.

""He's alone in there. Let's do him in. If his light were out we should have nothing to fear.""

The Count shook his head.

""He is armed and ready. If we shot him we could hardly get away in a place like this. Besides, it's likely enough that the police know whatever evidence he has got. Hallo! What was that?""

There was a vague sound which seemed to come from the window. Both men sprang round, but all was quiet. Save for the one strange figure seated in the chair, the room was certainly empty.

""Something in the street,"" said Merton. ""Now look here, guv'nor, you've got the brains. Surely you can think a way out of it. If slugging is no use then it's up to you.""

""I've fooled better men than he,"" the Count answered. ""The stone is here in my secret pocket. I take no chances leaving it about. It can be out of England to-night and cut into four pieces in Amsterdam before Sunday. He knows nothing of Van Seddar.""

""I thought Van Seddar was going next week.""

""He was. But now he must get off by the next boat. One or other of us must slip round with the stone to Lime Street and tell him.""

""But the false bottom ain't ready.""

""Well, he must take it as it is and chance it. There's not a moment to lose."" Again, with the sense of danger which becomes an instinct with the sportsman, he paused and looked hard at the window. Yes, it was surely from the street that the faint sound had come.

""As to Holmes,"" he continued, ""we can fool him easily enough. You see, the damned fool won't arrest us if he can get the stone. Well, we'll promise him the stone. We'll put him on the wrong track about it, and before he finds that it is the wrong track it will be in Holland and we out of the country.""

""That sounds good to me!"" cried Sam Merton with a grin.

""You go on and tell the Dutchman to get a move on him. I'll see this sucker and fill him up with a bogus confession. I'll tell him that the stone is in Liverpool. Confound that whining music; it gets on my nerves! By the time he finds it isn't in Liverpool it will be in quarters and we on the blue water. Come back here, out of a line with that keyhole. Here is the stone.""

""I wonder you dare carry it.""

""Where could I have it safer? If we could take it out of Whitehall someone else could surely take it out of my lodgings.""

""Let's have a look at it.""

Count Sylvius cast a somewhat unflattering glance at his associate and disregarded the unwashed hand which was extended towards him.

""What -- d'ye think I'm going to snatch it off you? See here, mister, I'm getting a bit tired of your ways.""

""Well, well, no offence, Sam. We can't afford to quarrel. Come over to the window if you want to see the beauty properly. Now hold it to the light! Here!""

""Thank you!""

With a single spring Holmes had leaped from the dummy's chair and had grasped the precious jewel. He held it now in one hand, while his other pointed a revolver at the Count's head. The two villains staggered back in utter amazement. Before they had recovered Holmes had pressed the electric bell.

""No violence, gentlemen -- no violence, I beg of you! Consider the furniture! It must be very clear to you that your position is an impossible one. The police are waiting below.""

The Count's bewilderment overmastered his rage and fear.

""But how the deuce --?"" he gasped.

""Your surprise is very natural. You are not aware that a second door from my bedroom leads behind that curtain. I fancied that you must have heard me when I displaced the figure, but luck was on my side. It gave me a chance of listening to your racy conversation which would have been painfully constrained had you been aware of my presence.""

The Count gave a gesture of resignation.

""We give you best, Holmes. I believe you are the devil himself.""

""Not far from him, at any rate,"" Holmes answered with a polite smile.

Sam Merton's slow intellect had only gradually appreciated the situation. Now, as the sound of heavy steps came from the stairs outside, he broke silence at last.

""A fair cop!"" said he. ""But, I say, what about that bloomin' fiddle! I hear it yet.""

""Tut, tut!"" Holmes answered. ""You are perfectly right. Let it play! These modern gramophones are a remarkable invention.""

There was an inrush of police, the handcuffs clicked and the criminals were led to the waiting cab. Watson lingered with Holmes, congratulating him upon this fresh leaf added to his laurels. Once more their conversation was interrupted by the imperturbable Billy with his card-tray.

""Lord Cantlemere sir.""

""Show him up, Billy. This is the eminent peer who represents the very highest interests,"" said Holmes. ""He is an excellent and loyal person, but rather of the old regime. Shall we make him unbend? Dare we venture upon a slight liberty? He knows, we may conjecture, nothing of what has occurred.""

The door opened to admit a thin, austere figure with a hatchet face and drooping mid-Victorian whiskers of a glossy blackness which hardly corresponded with the rounded shoulders and feeble gait. Holmes advanced affably, and shook an unresponsive hand.

""How do you do, Lord Cantlemere? It is chilly for the time of year, but rather warm indoors. May I take your overcoat?""

""No, I thank you; I will not take it off.""

Holmes laid his hand insistently upon the sleeve.

""Pray allow me! My friend Dr. Watson would assure you that these changes of temperature are most insidious.""

His Lordship shook himself free with some impatience.

""I am quite comfortable, sir. I have no need to stay. I have simply looked in to know how your self-appointed task was progressing.""

""It is difficult -- very difficult.""

""I feared that you would find it so.""

There was a distinct sneer in the old courtier's words and manner.

""Every man finds his limitations, Mr. Holmes, but at least it cures us of the weakness of self-satisfaction.""

""Yes, sir, I have been much perplexed.""

""No doubt.""

""Especially upon one point. Possibly you could help me upon it?""

""You apply for my advice rather late in the day. I thought that you had your own all-sufficient methods. Still, I am ready to help you.""

""You see, Lord Cantlemere, we can no doubt frame a case against the actual thieves.""

""When you have caught them.""

""Exactly. But the question is -- how shall we proceed against the receiver?""

""Is this not rather premature?""

""It is as well to have our plans ready. Now, what would you regard as final evidence against the receiver?""

""The actual possession of the stone.""

""You would arrest him upon that?""

""Most undoubtedly.""

Holmes seldom laughed, but he got as near it as his old friend Watson could remember.

""In that case, my dear sir, I shall be under the painful necessity of advising your arrest.""

Lord Cantlemere was very angry. Some of the ancient fires flickered up into his sallow cheeks.

""You take a great liberty, Mr. Holmes. In fifty years of official life I cannot recall such a case. I am a busy man, sir engaged upon important affairs, and I have no time or taste for foolish jokes. I may tell you frankly, sir, that I have never been a believer in your powers, and that I have always been of the opinion that the matter was far safer in the hands of the regular police force. Your conduct confirms all my conclusions. I have the honour, sir, to wish you good-evening.""

Holmes had swiftly changed his position and was between the peer and the door.

""One moment, sir,"" said he. ""To actually go off with the Mazarin stone would be a more serious offence than to be found in temporary possession of it.""

""Sir, this is intolerable! Let me pass.""

""Put your hand in the right-hand pocket of your overcoat.""

""What do you mean, sir?""

""Come -- come, do what I ask.""

An instant later the amazed peer was standing, blinking and stammering, with the great yellow stone on his shaking palm.

""What! What! How is this, Mr. Holmes?""

""Too bad, Lord Cantlemere, too bad!"" cried Holmes. ""My old friend here will tell you that I have an impish habit of practical joking. Also that I can never resist a dramatic situation. I took the liberty -- the very great liberty, I admit -- of putting the stone into your pocket at the beginning of our interview.""

The old peer stared from the stone to the smiling face before him.

""Sir, I am bewildered. But -- yes -- it is indeed the Mazarin stone. We are greatly your debtors, Mr. Holmes. Your sense of humour may, as you admit, be somewhat perverted, and its exhibition remarkably untimely, but at least I withdraw any reflection I have made upon your amazing professional powers. But how --""

""The case is but half finished; the details can wait. No doubt, Lord Cantlemere, your pleasure in telling of this successful result in the exalted circle to which you return will be some small atonement for my practical joke. Billy, you will show his Lordship out, and tell Mrs. Hudson that I should be glad if she would send up dinner for two as soon as possible.""",misc

MECCA.123 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

ELIF. LAM. RA.1 A book whose verses are stablished in wisdom and then set forth with clearness from the Wise, the All-informed

That ye worship none other than GodVerily I come to you from Him charged with warnings, announcements;

And that ye seek pardon of your Lord, and then be turned unto Him! Goodly enjoyments will He give you to enjoy until a destined time, and His favours will He bestow on every one who deserves his favours.2 But if ye turn away, then verily I fear for you the chastisement of the great day.

Unto God shall ye return, and over all things is he Potent.

Do they not doubly fold up their breasts, that they may hide themselves from Him?

But when they enshroud themselves in their garments, doth He not know alike what they conceal and what they shew?

For He knoweth the very inmost of their breast.

There is no moving thing on earth whose nourishment dependeth not on God; he knoweth its haunts and final resting place: all is in the clear Book.
And He it is who hath made the Heavens and the Earth in six days: His throne had stood ere this upon the waters,3 that He might make proof which of you4 would excel in works.

And if thou say, ""After death ye shall surely be raised again,"" the infidels will certainly exclaim, ""This is nothing but pure sorcery.""

And if we defer their chastisement to some definite time, they will exclaim, ""What keepeth it back?"" What! will it not come upon them on a day when there shall be none to avert it from them? And that at which they scoffed shall enclose them in on every side.

And if we cause man to taste our mercy, and then deprive him of it, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful.

And if after trouble hath befallen him we cause him to taste our favour, he will surely exclaim, ""The evils are passed away from me."" Verily, he is joyous, boastful.

Except those who endure with patience and do the things that are right: these doth pardon await and a great reward.

Perhaps thou wilt suppress a part of what hath been revealed to thee, and wilt be distress at heart lest they say, ""If a treasure be not sent down to him, or an angel come with him. . . ."" But thou art only a warner, and God hath all things in his charge.

If they shall say, ""The Koran is his own device,"" SAY: Then bring ten Suras like it5 of your devising, and call whom ye can to your aid beside God, if ye are men of truth.

But if they answer you not, then know that it hath been sent down to you in the wisdom of God only, and that there is no God but He. Are ye then Muslims?

Those who choose this present life and its braveries, we will recompense for their works therein: they shall have nothing less therein than their deserts.

These are they for whom there is nothing in the next world but the Fire: all that they have wrought in this life shall come to nought, and vain shall be all their doings.

With such can they be compared who rest upon clear proofs from their Lord? to whom a witness from him reciteth the Koran, and who is preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy? These have faith in it: but the partisans of idolatry, who believe not in it, are menaced with the fire! Have thou no doubts about that Book, for it is the very truth from thy Lord. But most men will not believe.

Who is guilty of a greater injustice than he who inventeth a lie concerning God? They shall be set before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, ""These are they who made their Lord a liar."" Shall not the malison of God be on these unjust doers,
Who pervert others from the way of God, and seek to make it crooked, and believe not in a life to come? God's power on earth they shall not weaken; and beside God they have no protector! Doubled shall be their punishment! They were not able to hearken, and they could not see.

These are they who have lost their own souls, and the deities of their own devising have vanished from them:

There is no doubt but that in the next world they shall be the lost ones.

But they who shall have believed and done the things that are right, and humbled them before their Lord, shall be the inmates of Paradise; therein shall they abide for ever.

These two sorts of persons resemble the blind and deaf, and the seeing and hearing: shall these be compared as alike? Ah! do ye not comprehend?

We sent Noah of old unto his people:""Verily I come to you a plain admonisher,

That ye worship none but God. Verily I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day.""

Then said the chiefs of his people who believed not, ""We see in thee but a man like ourselves; and we see not who have followed thee except our meanest ones of hasty judgment, nor see we any excellence in you above ourselves: nay, we deem you liars.""

He said: ""O my people! how think you? If I am upon a clear revelation from my Lord, who hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself to which ye are blind, can we force it on you, if ye are averse from it?

And, O my people! I ask you not for riches: my reward is of God alone: and I will not drive away those who believe that they shall meet their Lord:but I see that ye are an ignorant people.

And, O my people! were I to drive them away, who shall help me against God? Will ye not therefore consider?

And I tell you not that with me are the treasures of God: nor do I say, 'I know the things unseen;' nor do I say, 'I am an angel;' nor do I say of those whom you eye with scorn, No good thing will God bestow on them:God best knoweth what is in their mindsfor then should I be one of those who act unjustly.""

They said: ""O Noah! already hast thou disputed with us, and multiplied disputes with us: Bring then upon us what thou hast threatened, if thou be of those who speak truth.""
He said, ""God will bring it on you at His sole pleasure, and it is not you who can weaken him;

Nor, if God desire to mislead you, shall my counsel profit you, though I fain would counsel you aright. He is your Lord, and unto Him shall ye be brought back.

Do they say, ""This Koran is of his own devising?"" Say: On me be my own guilt, if I have devised it, but I am clear of that whereof ye are guilty.

And it was revealed unto Noah. Verily, none of thy people shall believe, save they who have believed already; therefore be not thou grieved at their doings.

But build the Ark under our eye and after our revelation: and plead not with me for the evil doers, for they are to be drowned.

So he built the Ark; and whenever the chiefs of his people passed by they laughed him to scorn:6 said he, ""Though ye laugh at us, we truly shall laugh at you, even as ye laugh at us; and in the end ye shall know

On whom a punishment shall come that shall shame him, and on whom shall light a lasting punishment.""

Thus was it until our sentence came to pass, and the earth's surface7 boiled up. We said, ""Carry into it one pair of every kind, and thy family, except him on whom sentence hath before been passed, and those who have believed."" But there believed not with him except a few.

And he said, ""Embark ye therein. In the name of God be its course and its riding at anchor! Truly my Lord is right Gracious, Merciful.""

And the Ark moved on with them amid waves like mountains: and Noah called to his son for he was apart""Embark with us, O my child! and be not with the unbelievers.""

He said, ""I will betake me to a mountain that shall secure me from the water."" He said, ""None shall be secure this day from the decree of God, save him on whom He shall have mercy."" And a wave passed between them, and he was among the drowned.

And it was said, ""O Earth! swallow up thy water;"" and ""cease, O Heaven!"" And the water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, and the Ark rested upon Al- Djoudi;8 and it was said, ""Avaunt! ye tribe of the wicked!""

And Noah called on his Lord and said, ""O Lord! verily my son is of my family: and thy promise is true, and thou art the most just of judges.""

He said, ""O Noah! verily, he is not of thy family: in this thou actest not aright.9 Ask not of me that whereof thou knowest nought: I warn thee that thou become not of the ignorant.

He said, ""To thee verily, O my Lord, do I repair lest I ask that of thee wherein I have no knowledge: unless thou forgive me and be merciful to me I shall be one of the lost.

It was said to him, ""O Noah! debark with peace from Us, and with blessings on thee and on peoples to be born from those who are with thee; but as for other and unbelieving peoples, we will give them their good things in this world, but hereafter shall a grievous punishment light on them from us.

This is one of the secret Histories: we reveal it unto thee: neither thou nor thy people knew it ere this: be patient thou: verily, there is a prosperous issue to the God-fearing.

And unto Ad we sent their Brother HOUD. He said, ""O my people, worship God. You have no God beside Him. Ye only devise a lie.

O my people! I ask of you no recompense for this: my recompense is with Him only who hath made me. Will ye not then understand?

O my people! ask pardon of your Lord; then be turned unto Him: He will send down the heavens upon you with copious rains:

And with strength on strength will He increase you: only turn not back with deeds of evil.""

They said, ""O Houd, thou hast not brought us proofs of thy mission: we will not abandon our gods at thy word, and we believe thee not.

We can only say that some of our gods have smitten thee with evil."" Said he, ""Now take I God to witness, and do ye also witness, that I am clear of your joining other gods

To God. Conspire then against me all of you, and delay me not.

For I trust in God, my Lord and yours. No single beast is there which he holdeth not by its forelock. Right, truly, is the way in which my Lord goeth.

But if ye turn back, I have already declared to you my message. And my Lord will put another people in your place, nor shall ye at all hurt Him; verily, my Lord keepeth watch over all things.""

And when our doom came to be inflicted, we rescued Houd and those who had like faith with Him, by our special mercy: we rescued them from the rigorous chastisement.

These men of Ad gainsaid the signs of their Lord, and rebelled against his messengers, and followed the bidding of every proud contumacious person.

Followed therefore were they in this world by a curse; and in the day of the Resurrection it shall be said to them, ""What! Did not Ad disbelieve their Lord?"" Was not Ad, the people of Houd, cast far away?

And unto Themoud we sent their Brother Saleh:10""O my people! said he, worship God: you have no other god than Him. He hath raised you up out of the earth, and hath given you to dwell therein. Ask pardon of him then, and be turned unto him; for thy Lord is nigh, ready to answer.""

They said, ""O Saleh! our hopes were fixed on thee till now:11 forbiddest thou us to worship what our fathers worshipped? Truly we misdoubt the faith to which thou callest us, as suspicious.""

He said, ""O my people! what think ye? If I have a revelation from my Lord to support me, and if He hath shewed his mercy on me, who could protect me from God if I rebel against him? Ye would only confer on me increase of ruin.

O my people! this is the she-Camel of God, and a sign unto you. Let her go at large and feed in God's earth, and do her no harm, lest a speedy punishment overtake you.""

Yet they hamstrung her: then said he, ""Yet three days more enjoy yourselves in your dwellings: this menace will not prove untrue.""

And when our sentence came to pass, we rescued Saleh and those who had a like faith with him, by our mercy, from ignominy on that day. Verily, thy Lord is the Strong, the Mighty!

And a violent tempest overtook the wicked, and they were found in the morning prostrate in their dwellings,

As though they had never abode in them. What! Did not Themoud disbelieve his Lord? Was not Themoud utterly cast off?

And our messengers came formerly to Abraham with glad tidings. ""Peace,"" said they. He said, ""Peace,"" and he tarried not, but brought a roasted calf.

And when he saw that their hands touched it not,12 he misliked them, and grew fearful of them. They said, ""Fear not, for we are sent to the people of Lot.""

His wife was standing by and laughed;13 and we announced Isaac to her; and after Isacc, Jacob.

She said, ""Ah, woe is me! shall I bear a son when I am old, and when this my husband is an old man? This truly would be a marvellous thing.""

They said, ""Marvellest thou at the command of God? God's mercy and blessing be upon you, O people of this house; praise and glory are His due!""

And when Abraham's fear had passed away, and these glad tidings had reached him, he pleaded with us for the people of Lot. Verily, Abraham was right kind, pitiful, relenting.

""O Abraham! desist from this; for already hath the command of thy God gone forth; as for them, a punishment not to be averted is coming on them.""

And when our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved for them; and he was too weak to protect them,14 and he said, ""This is a day of difficulty.""

And his people came rushing on towards him, for aforetime had they wrought this wickedness. He said, ""O my people! these my daughters will be purer for you: fear God, and put me not to shame in my guests. Is there no right minded man among you?""

They said, ""Thou knowest now that we need not thy daughters; and thou well knowest what we require.""

He said, ""Would that I had strength to resist you, or that I could find refuge with some powerful chieftain.""15

The Angels said, ""O Lot! verily, we are the messengers of thy Lord: they shall not touch thee: depart with thy family in the dead of night, and let not one of you turn back: as for thy wife, on her shall light what shall light on them. Verily, that with which they are threatened is for the morning. Is not the morning near?""

And when our decree came to be executed we turned those cities upside down, and we rained down upon them blocks of claystone one after another, marked 16 by thy Lord himself. Nor are they far distant from the wicked Meccans.

And we sent to Madian 17 their brother Shoaib. He said, ""O my people! worship God: no other God have you than He: give not short weight and measure: I see indeed that ye revel in good things; but I fear for you the punishment of the all-encompassing day.

O my people! give weight and measure with fairness; purloin not other men's goods; and perpetrate not injustice on the earth with corrupt practices:

A residue,18 the gift of God, will be best for you if ye are believers:

But I am not a guardian over you.""

They said to him, ""O Shoaib! is it thy prayers which enjoin that we should leave what our fathers worshipped, or that we should not do with our substance as pleaseth us? Thou forsooth art the mild, the right director!""

He said, ""O my people! How think ye? If I have a clear revelation from my Lord, and if from Himself He hath supplied me with goodly supplies, and if I will not follow you in that which I myself forbid you, do I seek aught but your amendment so far as in me lieth? My sole help is in God. In Him do I trust, and to Him do I turn me.

O my people! let not your opposition to me draw down upon you the like of that which befel the people of Noah, or the people of Houd, or the people of Saleh: and the abodes of the people of Lot are not far distant from you!

Seek pardon of your Lord and be turned unto Him: verily, my Lord is Merciful, Loving.

They said, ""O Shoaib! we understand not much of what thou sayest, and we clearly see that thou art powerless among us: were it not for thy family we would have surely stoned thee, nor couldst thou have prevailed against us.""

He said, ""O my people! think ye more highly of my family than of God? Cast ye Him behind your back, with neglect? Verily, my Lord is round about your actions.

And, O my people! act with what power ye can for my hurt: I verily will act: and ye shall know

On whom shall light a punishment that shall disgrace him, and who is the liar. Await ye; verily I will await with you.""

And when our decree came to pass, we delivered Shoaib and his companions in faith, by our mercy: And a violent tempest overtook the wicked, and in the morning they were found prostrate in their houses

As if they had never dwelt in them. Was not Madian swept off even as Themoud had been swept off?

Of old sent we Moses with our signs and with incontestable power to Pharaoh, and to his nobleswho followed the behests of Pharaoh, and, unrighteous were Pharaoh's behests.

He shall head his people on the day of the Resurrection and cause them to descend into the fire: and wretched the descent by which they shall descend!

They were followed by a curse in this world; and in the day of the
Resurrection, wretched the gift that shall be given them!

Such, the histories of the cities which we relate to thee. Some of them are standing, others mown down:

We dealt not unfairly by them, but they dealt not fairly by themselves: and their gods on whom they called beside God availed them not at all when thy Lord's behest came to pass. They did but increase their ruin.

Such was thy Lord's grasp19 when he laid that grasp on the cities that had been wicked. Verily his grasp is afflictive, terrible!

Herein truly is a sign for him who feareth the punishment of the latter day. That shall be a day unto which mankind shall be gathered together; that shall be a day witnessed by all creatures.

Nor do we delay it, but until a time appointed.

When that day shall come no one shall speak a word but by His leave, and some shall be miserable and others blessed.

And as for those who shall be consigned to misery their place the Fire! therein shall they sigh and bemoan them

Therein shall they abide while the Heavens and the Earth shall last, unless thy Lord shall will it otherwise; verily thy Lord doth what He chooseth.

And as for the blessed ones their place the Garden! therein shall they abide while the Heavens and the Earth endure, with whatever imperishable boon thy Lord may please to add.

Have thou no doubts therefore concerning that which they worship: they worship but what their fathers worshipped before them: we will surely assign them their portion with nothing lacking.

Of old gave we Moses the Book, and they fell to variance about it. If a decree of respite had not gone forth from thy Lord, there had surely been a decision between them. Thy people also are in suspicious doubts about the Koran.

And truly thy Lord will repay every one according to their works! for He is well aware of what they do.

Go straight on then as thou hast been commanded, and he also who hath turned to God with thee, and let him transgress no more. He beholdeth what ye do.

Lean not on the evil doers lest the Fire lay hold on you. Ye have no protector, save God, and ye shall not be helped against Him.

And observe prayer at early morning, at the close of the day, and at the approach of night; for the good deeds drive away the evil deeds. This is a warning for those who reflect:

And persevere steadfastly, for verily God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish.

Were the generations before you, endued with virtue, and who forbad corrupt doings on the earth, more than a few of those whom we delivered? but the evil doers followed their selfish pleasures, and became transgressors.

And thy Lord was not one who would destroy those cities unjustly, when its inhabitants were righteous.

Had thy Lord pleased he would have made mankind of one religion: but those only to whom thy Lord hath granted his mercy will cease to differ. And unto this hath He created them; for the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled, ""I will wholly fill hell with Djinn and men.""

And all that we have related to thee of the histories of these Apostles, is to confirm thy heart thereby. By these hath the truth reached thee, and a monition and warning to those who believe.

But say to those who believe not, ""Act as ye may and can: we will act our part: and wait ye; we verily will wait.""

To God belong the secret things of the Heavens and of the Earth: all things return to him: worship him then and put thy trust in Him: thy Lord is not regardless of your doings.20

1. See Sura lxviii. p. 32.

2. Or, will bestow his grace on every gracious one, or will bestow his abundance on every one who hath abundance (of merit). The difficulty of rendering this passage arises from the word fadhl, which means merit as applied to man, favour as applied to God.

3. That is, before the Creation. Precisely the same statement occurs in Raschi on Gen. i. 2, also in the modern catechism. Tsenah ur'enak b'noth Tsion, authoritatively put forth by the Polish and German Talmudist Rabbins. ""At the first creation of Heaven and Earth . . . the throne of glory of the Blessed God stood in the air above the waters."" Comp. Ps. civ. 3.

4. Men, heaven, and earth. Comp. Tr. Aboth, v. Mischna 1.

5. Comp. verse 37 and Sura [xci.] ii. 21. It should be observed that the challenge in these passages is not to produce a book which shall equal the Koran in point of poetry or rhetoric, but in the importance of its subject- matter with reference to the Divine Unity, the future retribution, etc. Upon these topics Muhammad well knew that he had preoccupied the ground. And we may infer from the fragments of the Revelations of Musailima and Sajâh (Hisam. 946; Attabâri (ed. Kosegarten) i. 134, 136, 152; Tab. Agâni, 339), which are mere imitations of the Koran, that he felt this to be the case.

6. ""They laughed and jeered at him in their words."" Midr. Tanchuma. ""The passage Job xii. 5, refers to the righteous Noah who taught them and spake to them words severe as flames: but they scorned him, and said, 'Old man! for what purpose is this ark?""' Sanhedr. 108. Comp. Midr. Rabbah on Gen. 30, and 33 on Eccl. ix. 14.

7. Or, oven: according to others, reservoir. Geiger thinks that the expression the oven boiled up may be a figurative mode of expressing the Rabbinic idea that ""the generation of the Deluge were punished by hot water."" Rosch. Haschanah, 16, 2; Sanhedr. 108. Comp. Weil's Legenden, p. 44.

8. The Montes Gordyoei, perhaps.

9. According to another reading: He hath done amiss. The origin of this story is probably Gen. ix. 20-25.

10. A Prophet, so far as we know, of Muhammad's own invention, unless Muir's conjecture be admitted that he was a Christian or Jewish missionary whose adventures and persecution were recast into this form.The name may have been suggested by, Methusaleh, upon whose piety the Midrasch enlarges.

20. In the later period of his life Muhammad attributed his gray hairs to the effect produced upon him by this Sura and its ""Sisters."" While Abu Bekr and Omar sat in the mosque at Medina, Muhammad suddenly came upon them from the door of one of his wives' houses. . . . And Abu Bekr said, ""Ah! thou for whom I would sacrifice father and mother, white hairs are hastening upon thee!"" And the Prophet raised up his beard with his hand and gazed at it; and Abu Bekr's eyes filled with tears. ""Yes,"" said Muhammad, ""Hûd and its sisters have hastened my white hairs.""

Suga 4 for the war outside
23rd settle 4 sprite than a spirit
Black shirts 4 angels that fly

Heard the ghetto sirens bout two times a day
Two fights today sent two knights away into pearly gates
The nuisance tippytoeing
In tuned 808s
Lasagna from bitty crumbs
(had to beg God just to sprinkle some)
Church service outside, lil kids get baptized, the city gun
(Black skin tainted since we was bitty young)
The ave painted frowns, little bitty suns
Cops dressing like Allah sincе baby pullups
Morningside smoke, monkey bars with thе pullups
Homies on the block
Asking God if He’ll pull up

Nike Shoes in pink clouds

It wasn't the girls
with their hard fingernails

It wasn't anything or anybody
It wasn't the wind
It wasn't the orange-colored noontime
Or night over the earth
It wasn't even the nose or the elbow
Or the hips getting bigger
or the ankle
or the air.
The plate broke, the lamp fell
All the flower pots tumbled over
one by one. That pot
which overflowed with scarlet
in the middle of October,
it got tired from all the violets
and another empty one
rolled round and round and round
all through winter
until it was only the powder
of a flowerpot,
a broken memory, shining dust.
And that clock
whose sound
was
the voice of our lives,
the secret
thread of our weeks,
which released
one by one, so many hours
for honey and silence
for so many births and jobs,
that clock also
fell
and its delicate blue guts
vibrated
among the broken glass
its wide heart
unsprung.

Life goes on grinding up
glass, wearing out clothes
making fragments
breaking down
forms
and what lasts through time
is like an island on a ship in the sea,
perishable
surrounded by dangerous fragility
by merciless waters and threats.
Let's put all our treasures together
-- the clocks, plates, cups cracked by the cold --
into a sack and carry them
to the sea
and let our possessions sink
into one alarming breaker
that sounds like a river.
May whatever breaks
be reconstructed by the sea
with the long labor of its tides.
So many useless things
which nobody broke
but which got broken anyway",misc

4710,"TERMS OF REFERENCE

The following report is submitted in response to the President's directive of January 31 which reads:

That the President direct the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reexamination of our objectives in peace and war and of the effect of these objectives on our strategic plans, in the light of the probable fission bomb capability and possible thermonuclear bomb capability of the Soviet Union.

The document which recommended that such a directive be issued reads in part:

It must be considered whether a decision to proceed with a program directed toward determining feasibility prejudges the more fundamental decisions (a) as to whether, in the event that a test of a thermonuclear weapon proves successful, such weapons should be stockpiled, or (b) if stockpiled, the conditions under which they might be used in war. If a test of a thermonuclear weapon proves successful, the pressures to produce and stockpile such weapons to be held for the same purposes for which fission bombs are then being held will be greatly increased. The question of use policy can be adequately assessed only as a part of a general reexamination of this country's strategic plans and its objectives in peace and war. Such reexamination would need to consider national policy not only with respect to possible thermonuclear weapons, but also with respect to fission weapons--viewed in the light of the probable fission bomb capability and the possible thermonuclear bomb capability of the Soviet Union. The moral, psychological, and political questions involved in this problem would need to be taken into account and be given due weight. The outcome of this reexamination would have a crucial bearing on the further question as to whether there should be a revision in the nature of the agreements, including the international control of atomic energy, which we have been seeking to reach with the U.S.S.R.

ANALYSIS

I. Background of the Present Crisis

Within the past thirty-five years the world has experienced two global wars of tremendous violence. It has witnessed two revolutions--the Russian and the Chinese--of extreme scope and intensity. It has also seen the collapse of five empires--the Ottoman, the Austro-Hungarian, German, Italian, and Japanese--and the drastic decline of two major imperial systems, the British and the French. During the span of one generation, the international distribution of power has been fundamentally altered. For several centuries it had proved impossible for any one nation to gain such preponderant strength that a coalition of other nations could not in time face it with greater strength. The international scene was marked by recurring periods of violence and war, but a system of sovereign and independent states was maintained, over which no state was able to achieve hegemony.

Two complex sets of factors have now basically altered this historic distribution of power. First, the defeat of Germany and Japan and the decline of the British and French Empires have interacted with the development of the United States and the Soviet Union in such a way that power increasingly gravitated to these two centers. Second, the Soviet Union, unlike previous aspirants to hegemony, is animated by a new fanatic faith, anti-thetical to our own, and seeks to impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world. Conflict has, therefore, become endemic and is waged, on the part of the Soviet Union, by violent or non-violent methods in accordance with the dictates of expediency. With the development of increasingly terrifying weapons of mass destruction, every individual faces the ever-present possibility of annihilation should the conflict enter the phase of total war.

On the one hand, the people of the world yearn for relief from the anxiety arising from the risk of atomic war. On the other hand, any substantial further extension of the area under the domination of the Kremlin would raise the possibility that no coalition adequate to confront the Kremlin with greater strength could be assembled. It is in this context that this Republic and its citizens in the ascendancy of their strength stand in their deepest peril.

The issues that face us are momentous, involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself. They are issues which will not await our deliberations. With conscience and resolution this Government and the people it represents must now take new and fateful decisions.
II. Fundamental Purpose of the United States

The fundamental purpose of the United States is laid down in the Preamble to the Constitution: "". . . to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."" In essence, the fundamental purpose is to assure the integrity and vitality of our free society, which is founded upon the dignity and worth of the individual.

Three realities emerge as a consequence of this purpose: Our determination to maintain the essential elements of individual freedom, as set forth in the Constitution and Bill of Rights; our determination to create conditions under which our free and democratic system can live and prosper; and our determination to fight if necessary to defend our way of life, for which as in the Declaration of Independence, ""with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.""

III. Fundamental Design of the Kremlin

The fundamental design of those who control the Soviet Union and the international communist movement is to retain and solidify their absolute power, first in the Soviet Union and second in the areas now under their control. In the minds of the Soviet leaders, however, achievement of this design requires the dynamic extension of their authority and the ultimate elimination of any effective opposition to their authority.

The design, therefore, calls for the complete subversion or forcible destruction of the machinery of government and structure of society in the countries of the non-Soviet world and their replacement by an apparatus and structure subservient to and controlled from the Kremlin. To that end Soviet efforts are now directed toward the domination of the Eurasian land mass. The United States, as the principal center of power in the non-Soviet world and the bulwark of opposition to Soviet expansion, is the principal enemy whose integrity and vitality must be subverted or destroyed by one means or another if the Kremlin is to achieve its fundamental design.

IV. The Underlying Conflict in the Realm of ideas and Values between the U.S. Purpose and the Kremlin Design

A. NATURE OF CONFLICT

The Kremlin regards the United States as the only major threat to the conflict between idea of slavery under the grim oligarchy of the Kremlin, which has come to a crisis with the polarization of power described in Section I, and the exclusive possession of atomic weapons by the two protagonists. The idea of freedom, moreover, is peculiarly and intolerably subversive of the idea of slavery. But the converse is not true. The implacable purpose of the slave state to eliminate the challenge of freedom has placed the two great powers at opposite poles. It is this fact which gives the present polarization of power the quality of crisis.

The free society values the individual as an end in himself, requiring of him only that measure of self-discipline and self-restraint which make the rights of each individual compatible with the rights of every other individual. The freedom of the individual has as its counterpart, therefore, the negative responsibility of the individual not to exercise his freedom in ways inconsistent with the freedom of other individuals and the positive responsibility to make constructive use of his freedom in the building of a just society.

From this idea of freedom with responsibility derives the marvelous diversity, the deep tolerance, the lawfulness of the free society. This is the explanation of the strength of free men. It constitutes the integrity and the vitality of a free and democratic system. The free society attempts to create and maintain an environment in which every individual has the opportunity to realize his creative powers. It also explains why the free society tolerates those within it who would use their freedom to destroy it. By the same token, in relations between nations, the prime reliance of the free society is on the strength and appeal of its idea, and it feels no compulsion sooner or later to bring all societies into conformity with it.

For the free society does not fear, it welcomes, diversity. It derives its strength from its hospitality even to antipathetic ideas. It is a market for free trade in ideas, secure in its faith that free men will take the best wares, and grow to a fuller and better realization of their powers in exercising their choice.

The idea of freedom is the most contagious idea in history, more contagious than the idea of submission to authority. For the breadth of freedom cannot be tolerated in a society which has come under the domination of an individual or group of individuals with a will to absolute power. Where the despot holds absolute power--the absolute power of the absolutely powerful will--all other wills must be subjugated in an act of willing submission, a degradation willed by the individual upon himself under the compulsion of a perverted faith. It is the first article of this faith that he finds and can only find the meaning of his existence in serving the ends of the system. The system becomes God, and submission to the will of God becomes submission to the will of the system. It is not enough to yield outwardly to the system--even Gandhian non-violence is not acceptable--for the spirit of resistance and the devotion to a higher authority might then remain, and the individual would not be wholly submissive.
The same compulsion which demands total power over all men within the Soviet state without a single exception, demands total power over all Communist Parties and all states under Soviet domination. Thus Stalin has said that the theory and tactics of Leninism as expounded by the Bolshevik party are mandatory for the proletarian parties of all countries. A true internationalist is defined as one who unhesitatingly upholds the position of the Soviet Union and in the satellite states true patriotism is love of the Soviet Union. By the same token the ""peace policy"" of the Soviet Union, described at a Party Congress as ""a more advantageous form of fighting capitalism,"" is a device to divide and immobilize the non-Communist world, and the peace the Soviet Union seeks is the peace of total conformity to Soviet policy.

The antipathy of slavery to freedom explains the iron curtain, the isolation, the autarchy of the society whose end is absolute power. The existence and persistence of the idea of freedom is a permanent and continuous threat to the foundation of the slave society; and it therefore regards as intolerable the long continued existence of freedom in the world. What is new, what makes the continuing crisis, is the polarization of power which now inescapably confronts the slave society with the free.

The assault on free institutions is world-wide now, and in the context of the present polarization of power a defeat of free institutions anywhere is a defeat everywhere. The shock we sustained in the destruction of Czechoslovakia was not in the measure of Czechoslovakia's material importance to us. In a material sense, her capabilities were already at Soviet disposal. But when the integrity of Czechoslovak institutions was destroyed, it was in the intangible scale of values that we registered a loss more damaging than the material loss we had already suffered.

Thus unwillingly our free society finds itself mortally challenged by the Soviet system. No other value system is so wholly irreconcilable with ours, so implacable in its purpose to destroy ours, so capable of turning to its own uses the most dangerous and divisive trends in our own society, no other so skillfully and powerfully evokes the elements of irrationality in human nature everywhere, and no other has the support of a great and growing center of military power.

B. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of a free society are determined by its fundamental values and by the necessity for maintaining the material environment in which they flourish. Logically and in fact, therefore, the Kremlin's challenge to the United States is directed not only to our values but to our physical capacity to protect their environment. It is a challenge which encompasses both peace and war and our objectives in peace and war must take account of it.

Thus we must make ourselves strong, both in the way in which we affirm our values in the conduct of our national life, and in the development of our military and economic strength.
We must lead in building a successfully functioning political and economic system in the free world. It is only by practical affirmation, abroad as well as at home, of our essential values, that we can preserve our own integrity, in which lies the real frustration of the Kremlin design.
But beyond thus affirming our values our policy and actions must be such as to foster a fundamental change in the nature of the Soviet system, a change toward which the frustration of the design is the first and perhaps the most important step. Clearly it will not only be less costly but more effective if this change occurs to a maximum extent as a result of internal forces in Soviet society.
In a shrinking world, which now faces the threat of atomic warfare, it is not an adequate objective merely to seek to check the Kremlin design, for the absence of order among nations is becoming less and less tolerable. This fact imposes on us, in our own interests, the responsibility of world leadership. It demands that we make the attempt, and accept the risks inherent in it, to bring about order and justice by means consistent with the principles of freedom and democracy. We should limit our requirement of the Soviet Union to its participation with other nations on the basis of equality and respect for the rights of others. Subject to this requirement, we must with our allies and the former subject peoples seek to create a world society based on the principle of consent. Its framework cannot be inflexible. It will consist of many national communities of great and varying abilities and resources, and hence of war potential. The seeds of conflicts will inevitably exist or will come into being. To acknowledge this is only to acknowledge the impossibility of a final solution. Not to acknowledge it can be fatally dangerous in a world in which there are no final solutions.

All these objectives of a free society are equally valid and necessary in peace and war. But every consideration of devotion to our fundamental values and to our national security demands that we seek to achieve them by the strategy of the cold war. It is only by developing the moral and material strength of the free world that the Soviet regime will become convinced of the falsity of its assumptions and that the pre-conditions for workable agreements can be created. By practically demonstrating the integrity and vitality of our system the free world widens the area of possible agreement and thus can hope gradually to bring about a Soviet acknowledgement of realities which in sum will eventually constitute a frustration of the Soviet design. Short of this, however, it might be possible to create a situation which will induce the Soviet Union to accommodate itself, with or without the conscious abandonment of its design, to coexistence on tolerable terms with the non-Soviet world. Such a development would be a triumph for the idea of freedom and democracy. It must be an immediate objective of United States policy.

There is no reason, in the event of war, for us to alter our overall objectives. They do not include unconditional surrender, the subjugation of the Russian peoples or a Russia shorn of its economic potential. Such a course would irrevocably unite the Russian people behind the regime which enslaves them. Rather these objectives contemplate Soviet acceptance of the specific and limited conditions requisite to an international environment in which free institutions can flourish, and in which the Russian peoples will have a new chance to work out their own destiny. If we can make the Russian people our allies in the enterprise we will obviously have made our task easier and victory more certain.

The objectives outlined in NSC 20/4 (November 23, 1948) ... are fully consistent with the objectives stated in this paper, and they remain valid. The growing intensity of the conflict which has been imposed upon us, however, requires the changes of emphasis and the additions that are apparent. Coupled with the probable fission bomb capability and possible thermonuclear bomb capability of the Soviet Union, the intensifying struggle requires us to face the fact that we can expect no lasting abatement of the crisis unless and until a change occurs in the nature of the Soviet system.

C. MEANS

The free society is limited in its choice of means to achieve its ends.
Compulsion is the negation of freedom, except when it is used to enforce the rights common to all. The resort to force, internally or externally, is therefore a last resort for a free society. The act is permissible only when one individual or groups of individuals within it threaten the basic rights of other individuals or when another society seeks to impose its will upon it. The free society cherishes and protects as fundamental the rights of the minority against the will of a majority, because these rights are the inalienable rights of each and every individual.

The resort to force, to compulsion, to the imposition of its will is therefore a difficult and dangerous act for a free society, which is warranted only in the face of even greater dangers. The necessity of the act must be clear and compelling; the act must commend itself to the overwhelming majority as an inescapable exception to the basic idea of freedom; or the regenerative capacity of free men after the act has been performed will be endangered.

The Kremlin is able to select whatever means are expedient in seeking to carry out its fundamental design. Thus it can make the best of several possible worlds, conducting the struggle on those levels where it considers it profitable and enjoying the benefits of a pseudo-peace on those levels where it is not ready for a contest. At the ideological or psychological level, in the struggle for men's minds, the conflict is worldwide. At the political and economic level, within states and in the relations between states, the struggle for power is being intensified. And at the military level, the Kremlin has thus far been careful not to commit a technical breach of the peace, although using its vast forces to intimidate its neighbors, and to support an aggressive foreign policy, and not hesitating through its agents to resort to arms in favorable circumstances. The attempt to carry out its fundamental design is being pressed, therefore, with all means which are believed expedient in the present situation, and the Kremlin has inextricably engaged us in the conflict between its design and our purpose.

We have no such freedom of choice, and least of all in the use of force. Resort to war is not only a last resort for a free society, but it is also an act which cannot definitively end the fundamental conflict in the realm of ideas. The idea of slavery can only be overcome by the timely and persistent demonstration of the superiority of the idea of freedom. Military victory alone would only partially and perhaps only temporarily affect the fundamental conflict, for although the ability of the Kremlin to threaten our security might be for a time destroyed, the resurgence of totalitarian forces and the re-establishment of the Soviet system or its equivalent would not be long delayed unless great progress were made in the fundamental conflict.

Practical and ideological considerations therefore both impel us to the conclusion that we have no choice but to demonstrate the superiority of the idea of freedom by its constructive application, and to attempt to change the world situation by means short of war in such a way as to frustrate the Kremlin design and hasten the decay of the Soviet system.

For us the role of military power is to serve the national purpose by deterring an attack upon us while we seek by other means to create an environment in which our free society can flourish, and by fighting, if necessary, to defend the integrity and vitality of our free society and to defeat any aggressor. The Kremlin uses Soviet military power to back up and serve the Kremlin design. It does not hesitate to use military force aggressively if that course is expedient in the achievement of its design. The differences between our fundamental purpose and the Kremlin design, therefore, are reflected in our respective attitudes toward and use of military force.

Our free society, confronted by a threat to its basic values, naturally will take such action, including the use of military force, as may be required to protect those values. The integrity of our system will not be jeopardized by any measures, covert or overt, violent or non-violent, which serve the purposes of frustrating the Kremlin design, nor does the necessity for conducting ourselves so as to affirm our values in actions as well as words forbid such measures, provided only they are appropriately calculated to that end and are not so excessive or misdirected as to make us enemies of the people instead of the evil men who have enslaved them.

But if war comes, what is the role of force? Unless we so use it that the Russian people can perceive that our effort is directed against the regime and its power for aggression, and not against their own interests, we will unite the regime and the people in the kind of last ditch fight in which no underlying problems are solved, new ones are created, and where our basic principles are obscured and compromised. If we do not in the application of force demonstrate the nature of our objectives we will, in fact, have compromised from the outset our fundamental purpose. In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) ""The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief."" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war. Our aim in applying force must be to compel the acceptance of terms consistent with our objectives, and our capabilities for the application of force should, therefore, within the limits of what we can sustain over the long pull, be congruent to the range of tasks which we may encounter.",misc

7460,"[Intro: DDay]
Got a text saying, “Someone called the cops”
Right then and there I felt my heart stop
Cold sweats running all down my spine
Am I really 'bout to be doing time?

[Verse 1: DDay]
Knocks on my door, my ass is grass
Cement floors, got the stash in the trash
“Hello officer. Hey, hi, how ya doing?
I was just on my way, my garbage is smelling putrid, but
You are welcome to stay and have a look around
It's me and my two friends, man, we just hanging out”
Frozen in conversation I stared at his retinas
As they scanned up and down my bag, man, let me tell ya
A nod in my direction got me steppin', it's a standoff
No looking back, “You can have it,” like a handoff
But I kept going, and I kept quiet
Trash bag on my back, this shit, I don't like it
This is it, this is life, this is war
This is what it feels like on rock bottom floor
As three policemen walked out that door
Knees shaking, I can't take any more
Free to go, like a dream it's unbelievable
For real though, just two years and some weeks ago
My life flashed right before my eyes
And I'm supposed to tell you I'm a different guy?
[Hook: DDay]
But I act the same, still act insane
Same player, but I'm playing to a different game
And though I may walk through the valley where the Devils dance
I thank God for giving me a second chance

[Verse 2: Moses]
Backdrop: 12 o'clock, driving on a Friday Night
Meant to stay straight, don't know why that I took a right
Down South Main, brain dumb when I'm wicked drunk
Baker's dozen shots of Evan got my stomach numb
Bright blue and white lights flicking in my hindsight
Visions of me taking a trip to the clink a third time
Am I dreaming? Am I even alive?
The only thing I really see is every second of my life
Flashing in front of my eyes because of a DUI
And a rap sheet as long as the unemployment line
Alcohol in my blood, point three two one
Went from wearing cuff links to some handcuffs
Sleeping on a metal bed thinking my future is done
How I'll never get a job, how'd I let my brother down
How it's gonna be impossible to make my parents proud
Or I do the opposite and choose to turn my life around
Took three days until I could see the sunlight
Breathe fresh air for what feels like the first time
Seems like the whole world is a little different now
It's bright when you've been living under a dark cloud
[Hook: Moses]",rap
4920,"Johnny on the spot
Wit the downhill powerwalk tomahawk chop
Wit the moxy and chops to pull up on your spot
Or your proxy's
Pop
And put it to a stop
Constant
Every toc we take it from the top
It's that 1 2 3 o'clock 4 o'clock rock
Get your app open
Plot the course you gotta trot
When the mad potent drop of course you gotta cop
Been a hot minute since i pulled up on the scene
Mad events was not foreseen
Next thing that i knew i was laying on a beach
Next thing that i knew i was balanced on a beam
Last thing that i knew i was rhyming on a beat
Now everything's back to how it oughta be
No problem to clutch a mountain by the peak
Now that i can touch the bottom of the sea
Stuck in my prime, full time heavyweight
Three or four hotties chillin poolside anyway
Me and mono done sold game to gave game away
Found the hypotenuse
Barbecues labor day
Stones Throw done gone off the deep end
Wit enemies like that well who needs friends?
Christians told me to repent
But i ain't too pressed
No reason to pretend
My bad pastor and deacon
Signed, boy sand, grandmaster of weekends
Widespread hassle and nuisance
Not enough time spent following blueprints
Not enough time spent tying up loose ends
Every joe schmoe wanna put in they two scents
And every jane schmane wanna throw in they two more
Nonsense, they was my scent but i threw em off
I do it all
This and that, such and such, way too much to recall
31 flavors come visit and do the waltz
Nosey ass neighbors stay listening through the wall
Not your regular booty call
Ain't no thing to dig in the booty if duty calls
I be beating the booty like it was the booty fault
Pull out spray on the beauty a beautiful waterfall
That's TMI i just realized, me and mine
Fast track, SESAC, ASCAP, BMI
Just wasn't in the cards until the stars realigned
All the way, on our way's gone away, we arrived
The reason why is it's about time
People think of planets like there's just about nine
20, 30 more you can expect to find expect to find life
Talking just about mine
Seated head of class the first and last of my kind
Then i hit the s'mac up for a nosh of alpine
Don't knock it till you try it
You may ask me what about the government lying
I would answer to you that's your problem not mine
I'd be not lying
Listen i got mine so i do not mind
Before i got mine i had to stop trying
Before i got mine i had to stop crying
Blink of an eye look what has transpired
Find me and my camp around the camp fire
Sat hatching a plan to build a empire
Ain't one yesman

Johnny on the sphere
If anybody asks i was never here
In the lunchroom sitting alone my whole career
Wear my pants so you cannot see my underwear
Clad in scuba gear
When i bounce i never bring back a souvenir
When it come to kick and the snare I'm never scared
You could tell by smile i wear from ear to ear
Kinda weird, now and then 12 months of the year i'll grow a beard
Wish you good luck finding the rules to which i adhere
Take my last buck, give it to a bum to buy a beer
Shed a tear for my once luscious glorious full head of hair
It did not help getting it back to say a prayer
But thank god that it didn't stop my being a player
Is that clear
I try to always keep a pad wit a Pam Grier
I'm known to always keep a flask of the panacea
I'm known for dropping in and crashing on Pangea
Down and dirtier than Bill Lambeer
Pull up looking like the president of Zambia
Must have caught a pine needle in my pineal
Bust off on your couch and now your couch from Ikea
That don't make sense but rest in peace in Phife
Type to throw a bee hive in a street fight
Just the type to bee-line into deep night
With a policy to decline to any e-vite
Only deep flies
Never three strikes
Never deep fried
Only green lights
World tour all of outdoors
Every drop of hot sauce
Nothing outsourced
Cry out for a encore from the hardcore
Introduce your in-laws to the outlaw
Greatest look since dinosaurs and the protozoa
Greatest hooks since southpaw rocky balboa
Before i lived in Brooklyn i was livin in the Lowa
Chicks that look like Selma Hayek dancing wit a boa
Always interrupt and run up on me outta nowhere
Take em to Chipotle and get extra barbacoa
Just 'cause i'm the object of they passion and desire
Doesn't mean i'm splurging on they fashionable attire
Honey got reliant, started calling me a liar
Had to tell her no ma'am

Surely no one has let the cold jeg their knees

Where the sky on a too-full stomach
Tucks itself into the sea

Like two taps with a spoon
Would split its lid in two

The wind that burls me
Does not feel second hand
It’s as true as a first-word
That repaints the front room it cuts through

Sounds stretched to an echo
So no one remembers how language used to land
The sand
Is out the packet new
Branded with my shoes
Maybe the sun is knackered too
Like each of us
Wrapped up in our work, and ourselves
Dreaming of being shelled by our backpacks
And swallowed by the beach

Maybe it's a parent
Too tired to keep playing
That lies through their teeth
Because all pain is small change
In the cost of wonder

Rising somewhere else while we see it sleep
Returning its light
In the nick of time
So that not a grain is lost
Not a bloat of cloud burst
Not a wave out of place

I must be the first

Everything I have
Was given to me clean
Like the sky burns just to blush my face

I have held it up
Ungloved
Crushed seaweed beneath me
Breathed in the beach until I have a new set of lungs
But I have never wiped sunrise down my jumper
To get rid of fingerprints
I never took my shoes off as I came in",pop

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth""
Hey-hey

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Whoo)
She says I am the one (Oh baby), but the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee)
No, no (Hee-hee-hee)
Woo

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Whoo)
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice! (Hoo)

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo, my baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh no)
So we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Hee-hee-hee)

People always told me, ""Be careful what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee)
But she came and stood right by me
And just smell the sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

I'm wondering if my thoughts of her
Have ever crossed her thoughts of me
And if they're half as clear as mine
And if there'll ever be a time
For us to journey once again
As lovers and as trusted friends
What if the best is yet to come
And this was only the first part run

Get a hold of yourself
Don't worry about the aftermath
There is no one after you
Or on your back
Get a hold of yourself
Don't worry about the aftermath
There is no one after you

But the everyday just can't compete
With the beauty of a polaroid
Where the fairytale endures complete
And her eyes are always full of joy
Like a frozen glimpse of butterflies
On a colourized celluloid sky
She waves her cheerful last goodbye
And begs for me to let past things slide

Get a hold of yourself
And don't worry about the aftermath

No one on your back

Smoking and reading me out with a laugh
Making me feel like I'm broken in half

The future's full of noise that I can't repair

Let's kick it
Isis Isis Baby, Isis Isis Baby.

Alright, stop,
The Caliphate has risen; Isis attacks on a worldwide mission
Following the great prophet's writing: ""Kill the infidel wherever you find him.""
Doing a jihad, that's holy war
Everyone literally hit the floor
This is how we roll, we're not too gentle
Word of Allah is fundamental.

Damn, Ahmed is cool; he blew up a hospital and two schools
Spilling the blood of our enemies
The jihad will go on for centuries
Non-believers, prepare to pay
The word of Allah you disobey
If you're crazy, Sunni and proud of it, dance to the hook that I sing in Arabic.

Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever.
Now the jihad is coming to a theatre near you, everybody jumping
""Shit, there's a bomb!""
""Run to the exit!""
Where are you going? It's opening credits!
I hear this movie's real good, sit down have some Pringles
We're dying to see this movie tonight; worst first date ever, am I right?
Hope you like movies in 3D
Explosions real close and pretty, so interactive
If you don't like it, should've waited for DVD
You can watch the sequel in your next life
Now your house belongs to your ex-wife
Your new address is hell
Who knew a movie could do so well and bomb
""That was good, come on; I'll put down my gun, we're having fun!"" ""My dynamite is on a timer, girl, got some time to kill - infidels.""
""Ready? We're about to die, this good time to apologize to Allah for your life of sin like eating ham and drinking gin.""
""No, no, no, no, these are forbidden like marriage to more than four women.""
""Bro, you have a lot to learn; ten more seconds 'til you burn in hell for not following God's will.""
""I know jihad can be a buzzkill. If there is a problem, bro, I'll solve it; look at the bomb tucked under my armpit.""

Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever.

Taking over the world as we know it
""Here's the bomb, bro, don't blow it!""
Take down the great Satan and Canada; I really hate them
It's time to kill non-believers and infidels
Won't stop until everyone's dead
Spread peace just like the Qur'an said
Blood-shed is how truth is spread
Painting Allah's planet red
Soon, everyone will submit to Islam
""Bro, get ready, it'll be fun!""
Death to apostates; Christians, too; say goodbye to the gays and jews
""If there is a problem, bro I'll solve it,""
""Get ready for a worldwide caliphate.""
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever
Isis Isis Baby, (bro) forever
Isis Isis Baby, forever.
Isis!
""Bro, man let's get out of here.""
""Word to Osama.""

Big moves in my rounds
Flip £200 on every turn, till I run the game

My arsenal is local
Load heat, with vocals
Bars so toxic, I’ll be on every radio wave, Chernobyl
Passionate every time I make a move
Yesterday's me is who I look up to
So much so when I see myself progress it just feels like deja vu
Ah shit here we go again
A rapper who thinks he’s best with a pen
Let me stop you right there that ain’t me
Coz I write my bars on my iPhone 10
Inspiration all all around me
From the pain of the past to moment surrounding
So much so, that since the start of this track I could pen up 2 albums
Freestyling feels so comfy
Practice every day till it brings money
Learnt so much from my bro Cadet, I still study your 14 lines on Pumpy
6 months, all progress
More Spare time dedicated to the greats
Reading into ever bar, ever flow
Putting double meaning in a word, that’s genius
Dissect the beat like its musical science
Learn from each other is the worlds climate
If I ever see far, you know I’ll be standing on the shoulders of these giants
I’m still here, till I get a piece of the pie
Music is the voice that narrates  my life
Putting my all in every line
In case it ends, i wanna leave a good goodbye
Still here till I just can’t rhyme
Swear my end of days is nearby
But I don’t give a damn and I will never stop till get to the end, don’t see red light
Oh you think I’m done with shit
Na this the one item on the list with a tick
Got about 20 more ideas ima get done before your boy starts calling it quits
A novel, a film, an app, so merch, a blog, a pod and even a tour in the six
Trust me when I say my cup ran over with the all the energy that comes from within
120 on the dash when I’m chasing a win
If you don’t keep up, you’ll be gone in a blink
When your standing under my private jet is the only time you’ll be under my wing
No guidance
No silence
We move loud and proud with no violence
Only science we do is alchemy coz you know our touch like Midas
In a blink on an eyes, we gleaming
In a blink of an eyes, we demons

Scars don’t heal when it’s bleeding

Pace around without the lights on
I can hear the dogs over at the farm house
No one's home and it's wet and cold outside
Been home alone for 7 days now
Sleeping away through the day time
Waking up whenever the stars come out

[Verse 2]
The moon pours in over the carpet
Like I'm in a shuttle orbiting planets
But it looks more like a spooky graveyard at the edge of town
Feels like someone's watching me
Feels like I've got some company
This yard is haunted
This house is a tomb
I'm frightеned of what is lurking around the corner
I keep hеaring all these voices coming from the rooms

It's freezing in here and something doesn't seem right
I don't know what I'm supposed to do

I'm gonna get over this
I'm calling an exorcist, she's gonna clear these rooms

I can't do it bruv, I'm tired and stressed
My mind is a mess, I'm sick of living life in my head
Anxiety is like a knife in my chest, it makes it hard to breathe
My heart is weak and it's dying for strength
I've seen shit that I still fuckin dream about
I need to blow my brains on the wall to let my demons out
I used to have a family but I don't see them now
That's why I'm so closed off and hardly ever leave the house

[Verse 2: Dwizofoz]
Look me in the eyes bruv, listen to my words
I know this shits been hurtin since the minute of your birth
And you're feeling like where you belong, isn't here on earth
But you got too much to live for and this decision is the worst
Plus your little brothers need you
River's just a verse, without you Shaff will wind up in prison or a hearse
I know you wanna live to see your missus giving birth
And be there for your child, and be the dad that you deserve (you deserve)

[Verse 3: Flowz Dilione]
But in my head, they'll be better when I'm gone
When I'm dead I hope they don't remember me at all
When they send me to the morgue, I don't wanna be identified
I don't wanna be seen by any family or friends of mine
Especially Riv, the best friend I ever had
I've already broken his heart and I can't handle that
I'm too weak to carry the weight like cheap anvil straps
Everything I've ever had is gone and I can't get it back
[Verse 4: Dwizofoz]
Well if for no one else, do it for you bruv
Do it to say fuck your past, do it for your future
You're stronger than you know bruv, I'm telling you
I'll be by your side every step, if you want I'll go to hell with you
And pull you out the other side breathin
I know that's not you wanting to die bro, that's just the pipe speakin
Ice weakens the will to fight demons, I've seen it
I won't let it happen to you, You know what I'm sayin is true

[Verse 5: Flowz Dilione]
If not for me I should prevail for them
Cause they have everything to lose and I'm just waitin for death
I say I'm strong and loyal, if I was I'd stay to the end
And hold my whole fam down till the die that I'm dead
I'd be the king that my queen deserves
A brother to Shaff, Sittin next to Riv laughing with my mum and my dad
But I'm not so I'm sittin drunk mumbling raps
Depressed confessions sippin liquor with a gun in my lap

[Verse 6: Dwizofoz]
See that's the you I know, the you I know you wanna be
I know you at war with yourself and all you want is peace
But brother please just give me the piece, it's not your time to go
I'm talkin to Taylor now I'm not talkin to Flowz
I just wish I would've told you this sooner
We can't change the past but you could've had a whole different future
And I just can't let go, listening to the echoes of your voice
While I'm sitting here talkin to your headstone

Could I have helped it?
How have I been led to feel this way?
I let your problems get the best of me

Thinking back I remember it
The moment I should've quit
You were probably pushing it
Weak as I was, I would sit with it

I could leave the mix 'cause I'm sick of it
But every time I reach the door
A voice inside my head is begging

It was you who didn't do what you promise you would

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't worth it
But this one's on you

This timе really hurt
I'm no longer hoping to make this shit work
When it wasn't my fault
That your ego ate dirt
And now that I really see
You were testing me, thinking less of me
I'm strong enough to help myself
But then I hear the voices yelling

I saw the phantoms of my friends, but they were gone too soon

Until a silence overwhelmed them, and I began to speak

They've come before, and many more will try to strike me down
Hear my battle cry, hear that mighty roar

He won my lover in a dirty game of solitaire
He stole my crown and placed it crookedly upon his head
He turned around, I took him down, and this is what I said

Guess it didn't matter we were getting better
And all that cheesy crap I thought was a lie
I guess you didn't realise my feelings were true
And maybe you dropped hints but I didn't have a clue
That our so precious love would soon die
And I didn't get to ask you why

So you slipped through my fingers like sand
And I didn't see it didn't understand
Now it's too late to get another chance
You don't need to apologise

And now you're probably wondering how I'm doing, well don't - cause you'll be fine and I won't

Saturday night, a message on my phone
You said it right out, suddenly I was alone
You didn't even care to say it face to face (nah)
And I guess you didn't know you put me in pain, but your words ran over my heart like a train
And better I believe you needed some space
And I would be sad for days

We had nothing in common and we didn't work out
But you hooked up my heart and made me your boy scout

So you slipped through my fingers like sand

I read through your lyrics and I do not wanna hear it
Yeah you comin onto me and I see what ya doin
You live like a rockstar leavin lives in ruins
Say you wanna rock hard

I read through your lyrics and I do not wanna hear it

Typing up a text and I clear it with the quickness
Say we gon collab but don’t seem like you on a mission
When I get in the lab and hit your phone the calls keep missin
Cause you out here dissin
Want some kissin but won’t listen to my mixes
You just fuck then boo love
Too tough to get in new stuff
You want all the crew love

Yeah you comin onto me and I see what ya doin
You live like a rockstar leavin lives in ruins
Say you wanna rock hard
But I see through the music
I read through your lyrics and I do not wanna hear it

You tryna get inside my head
Something can just be left unsaid
But why just read between the lines instead of diving deeper?
I can see it when you’re teasin
And I thought of every reason just to change my fuckin number
Change my the city in the summer, change my name to
So it fits well with my title
And block you on all my socials
So you can’t hear all my vocals
Block the plugs from in your phone because I know that you a smoker
(Aw yeah yeah)

I used to want to party like a rockstar
Then I started listening to my heart
Listening to my heart
Yeah you comin onto me and I see what ya doin
You live like a rockstar leavin lives in ruins
Say you wanna rock hard
But I see through the music
I read through your lyrics and I do not wanna hear it
Yeah you comin onto me and I see what ya doin
You live like a rockstar leavin lives in ruins
Say you wanna rock hard

122,"You came in like I couldn't predict it

I’m working way too little to have you

With you, it's all starting on a Sunday

The rest of the week never has to happen



I been looking for someone

To take my time

I'll take yours if you’ll take mine

We can just hang around inside

Chill with the bedpost, the sofa

Simplicity divine


'Cause this is more than a love

More than a life

More than a color

A new mood or vibe



It's off the cuff

A new drug for creature comfort

Consequence be rid of me




I'm more than a man

More than a date

More than a feeling
For your heart to relate

I'm your next big addiction to celebrate

Nothing feels better than feeling your fate

Don't you worry 'bout me now I'm home

We’re home


Don’t you worry 'bout me now I’m home

We're home


So I woke up thinking

Why should I even fight these feelings when I feel them sinking?

Cup runneth over when it comes drinking

And let the moments flash us when the lights are bound to blinking


I'm just saving my piece

To save you peace of mind just go head and blame it on me

Bottling it up might be safer to see


You unpredictable,  couldn't foreshadow the disruption

Beauty and the essence of you allows me not to function

Madness that you give me on a weekly basis

Not because you’re crazy but instead you're patient


Energy in world now I've felt reciprocation

Levels of excitement often need containment

You came in like I couldn't predict it

I'm working way too little to have you


With you it's all starting on a Sunday

The rest of the week never has to happen

Don't you worry 'bout me now I'm home


We're home


Don't you worry 'bout me now I'm home


We're home


Life feels better when you just exist


Living in the moment, I don't plan for what it is

No apologies, this the way I choose to live

So much love to spread I hope you're getting what I give",pop

I feel it all, I recall when we were new
I never thought I’d take so long forgetting you
I lie awake in the dark and wonder how you are too much
Do you do the same, love?

[Verse 2]
Moment we met, I recollect your poise and your charm
The way you had me at a glance then held me in the palm
Of your hand, drew me into your light
How could I help it when you burned so bright?

[Pre-Chorus]
You stood in the open doorway
And I knew we had the whole day to wile away
We thought that place and time were on our side
But when it all fell through
I took the weight of what we’d come to

[Chorus]
Now I feel it all, I’m one to feel it all
I will unwind, I will unwind
I will feel it all, I want to feel it all
I will unwind, I am untied and I am porous
I am sure that there is more to this than I care to admit
I feel it all, all
All, all, all

I filled a void in the time you needed me to
I made a home out of us too soon
Unfurled, ardent and wide open armed
I came undone and I let down my guard

And so it started, up in your apartment
I had never felt more like myself
But place and time were never on our side
We let it all fall through
I take the weight of what we came to
What is it that we’ve come to?

Now I feel it all, I’m one to feel it all

[Voiced by Jimmy Threecocks]

It says a lot about a man who’s willing to make an entire game dedicated to his extremely specific fetish. It says even more about the man who nominates it for an award specifically because of that dedication to the fetish.

Helltaker’s quest for a harem of women is reminiscent of my own adventures. Plunging deeper and deeper into the bowels of Lord-knows-what, or who, on a never-ending journey of getting absolutely fucking smothered by thick-thighed, business professional demonic women.

Living up to the term “free-love,” Helltaker as well offers you this experience for the low, low price of absolutely nothing. You too can journey down to the depths of depravity with the sole intention of getting fucked. Hell, you’ll probably be coming out with a profit after you make your deposit into the spank bank.

You know, this world is..
It's coming to an end and I just need to tell you something..

She want to get to know me better
I said ""Babe, it's now or never""
She like the way I ball like Kyrie
I said she look just like Kylie
I want to take her world away from her

I'm a little dangerous

Blow ‘em a kiss and say bye bye, friend

And she’s never coming back again
When she said goodbye the words they came quick
She spit ’em out fast and I felt so sick
Now there ain’t nothing magic in this magic trick
Cause she’s never coming back again

She never really knew me anyway
She taped her regrets to my microphone stand

Ain’t got a clue how to get back home
Guess I’d better ask at the bar

4585,"Decided on June 6, 2006
Supreme Court, Kings County

Sephardic Lebanese Congregation, Inc., Plaintiff,

against

Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut, Defendant.

52604/02

Yvonne Lewis, J.

Defendant, Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut (hereinafter, Travelers), has moved this court for an order, pursuant to CPLR 3212, granting summary judgment dismissing the complaint herein. Travelers asserts that the plaintiff's insurance policy does not provide coverage on the property damage claim for water damage that the plaintiff, Sephardic Lebanese Congregation, Inc. (hereinafter, Sephardic) sustained on January 6, 2002 from a toilet overflow in its (Sephardic's) premises. More to the point, Travelers asserts that ""[t]he policy excludes coverage for damages caused by water which backs up through sewers or drains when the stoppage is located in pipes off the insured premises [except where the cause of the back up originates on the insured premises]. The policy provides coverage when the stoppage is in pipes on the insured's premises. The evidence is overwhelming that the flooding plaintiff sustained was due to a stoppage, not on its premises, but in the city sewer main beneath the public thoroughfares. Given the facts of the case[,] plaintiff has no right of recovery here and its complaint must be dismissed."" In support of that contention, Travelers points to three facts; to wit, 1. that a private plumber called by the plaintiff snaked its pipes, was unable to clear the stoppage, and thereupon directed Sephardic to the Department of Environmental Protection (hereinafter, DEP); 2. that DEP, which according to a deposed supervisor does not work on private sewer lines, responded to Sephardic's premises, but thereafter resolved the problem by clearing a blockage in the city sewer main outside of the plaintiff's premises; and, 3. that its privately retained professional engineer concluded "". . .within a reasonable degree of engineering certainty, [that] plaintiff's flood was due to a stoppage in the city's sewer lines underneath the public thoroughfares and not because of any condition originating within plaintiff's premises.""

Sephardic interposed a cross-motion for an order, pursuant to CPLR §3212, granting it summary judgment for the following reasons. The DEP supervisor referenced by Travelers ""testified throughout his deposition that he lacks any knowledge of the events that took place at the subject premises the night of the loss. Not only was [he] not present, he was not even the supervisor assigned to the service call."" The professional engineer, in turn, failed to detail any substantive tests that he conducted to determine the cause of the alleged backup. The report that he submitted is dated prior to receipt of any documents from DEP that he claims to have relied upon. Hence, his "". . .conclusions were drawn without personal knowledge and without any documentary support."" Sephardic also argues that Travelers' position is flawed in that

"". . .the subject policy fails to define what a back up,' as referenced to in the policy, actually

is. . . .[and] Travelers has failed to offer any evidence from anyone who can testify that the origin of the water entering the premises was the result of a back up' in the City's water mains as oppose (sic) to another source."" Sephardic posits that it could have been the result of the excess rain (almost an inch over four to five hours) that had fallen, as evidenced by the climatological data report for the day in question. In addition, Sephardic notes that there is no explanation given for the cause of the interruption in the water main. Finally, Sephardic asserts that "". . .no investigation was done to determine the nature of the substance that entered the premises. [*2]Accordingly, Defendant failed to show that the substance entering Plaintiff's premises was water, as required by the policy. . . .the substance that entered the premises was not water. It was brownish in color, had an arduous smell, and contained a significant amount of dirt and other filth [sewage]."" More particularly, in its memorandum of law, Sephardic highlighted that ""[u]nder New York law, it is well settled that terms in insurance policies should be given their plain, ordinary meaning by the courts. Caporino v. Traveler's Insurance Co., 62 NY2d 234, 476 NYS2d 519 (1984). The tests to be applied in construing an insurance policy are common speech. . .and the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary businessman. Ace Wire & Cable Co., Inc. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Company, 60 NY2d 390, 469 NYS2d 655 (1983). The rationale is that if the policy language is unclear and can reasonably be interpreted in a way that affords coverage, the ambiguity should be resolved against the insurer, the draftsman of the language. Moshinko, Inc. v. Seiger & Smith, Inc., 137 AD2d 170, 529 NYS2d 284 (1st Dept., 1988). In addition, Sephardic maintains that ""New York courts have consistently held that under an all risk policy of insurance, losses are covered unless specifically excluded. MH Lipiner v. The Hanover Ins. Co., 869 Fed 685 (2nd Cir. 1989); Chase Manhattan Bank v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., 193 Misc 2d 580. . . .Accordingly, the insurer has [the] burden to demonstrate that the loss of covered property resulted from facts placing the loss within the exclusion in the policy in order to avoid liability. Allied Van Lines Intern. Corp. v. Centennial Ins. Co., 685 F. Supp. 344 [S.D.NY, 1988]). Furthermore, Sephardic argues that ""where comprehensive words in a contract are followed by an enumeration of specific things, under the rule of ejusdem generis the things coming within the comprehensive words will be limited to those of a like nature to those enumerated."" Popkin v. Security Mutual Insurance Company of New York, 48 AD2d 46, 367 NYS2d 492 [1st Dept., 1975]). Therefore, water flowing from a toilet and into the subject premises [such as here] cannot be understood to be included as an other opening' which would fall under an exclusion under the subject policy.
On the basis of the preceding, Sephardic argues that Travelers "". . .has failed to provide any conclusive proof or evidence demonstrating that a back up' constitutes water coming through the sewers and drains, regardless of its source,"" and/or to "". . .conclusively determine the actual cause of the water damage."" In addition, Sephardic points out that an additional policy endorsement dealing with ""Off Premises Services"" provides for coverage for when there is loss or damage as a result of interruption to the water supply services, specifically including the water mains, which then causes a loss or damage to the subject premises. Therefore, Travelers' request for summary judgment should be denied as there are significant issues of fact to be resolved and sufficient ambiguities within the contract terms to warrant coverage in the matter sub judice.

Travelers submitted a reply affirmation, in further support of its motion for summary judgment and in opposition to Sephardic's cross-motion for such relief, wherein it's Technical Specialist (with St. Paul Travelers insurance) reiterated and clarified his deposition testimony in two ways; namely, that he knew "". . .that the back up that occurred in this case was not due to water that first went down plaintiff's pipes[;]"" and, that the engineer's report clearly established that "". . .the approximately 45,300 gallons of water that entered the plaintiff's premises came from the public sewer system. . .[and] could not have come from plaintiff's own premises."" Travelers also cited a series of other jurisdictional (non-New York) cases that clearly stand for the proposition that the plain and ordinary meaning of the water damage exclusion water that backs up through sewers and drains includes water containing raw sewage. Travelers also pointed to the matter of Reynolds v. Standard Fire Insurance company, 221 AD2d 616, 634 NYS2d 163 (2d Dept., 1995), wherein the Appellate Division, Second Department allowed the subject exclusion because the insureds' loss was directly attributable to an oil tank leak which had been indirectly caused by a basement water flood. Finally, Travelers notes that its memorandum of law is clearly permissible inasmuch as Sephardic, in addition to opposing its request for summary judgment, has cross-moved for the same relief.

In its reply, Sephardic argues that the DEP supervisor indicated that there may have been multiple blockages, not limited to the water main. In addition, it reiterated its arguments that the [*3]terms water and back-up in the policy are ambiguous, and that the Power Pac Endorsement (Off Premises Services) provisions provide an alternative basis for coverage when there is an interruption in water service even where an exclusion applies.

""A party seeking summary judgment must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, tendering sufficient evidence to demonstrate the absence of any material issues of fact"" (Ayotte v. Grevasioi, 81 NY2d 1062, 601 NYS2d 463; Alvarez v. Prospect Hosp., 68 NY2d 320, 508 NYS2d 923). Once a prima facie showing has been made, the burden shifts to the opposing party to produce evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to establish the existence of material questions of fact (see Alvarez v. Prospect Hosp., supra ).

The law, as hereinabove set forth, establishes that terms in insurance policies should be given their plain, ordinary meaning by the courts (Caporino v. Traveler's Insurance Co., supra , 62 NY2d 234, 476 NYS2d 519 (1984), and that the tests to be applied in construing an insurance policy are common speech. . .and the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary businessman (Ace Wire & Cable Co., Inc. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Company, supra , 60 NY2d 390, 469 NYS2d 655 [1983]). Using those criteria, this court can find neither find a basis to conclude that the damage was caused by anything other than water inseparably mixed with raw sewage that resulted from a stoppage in the water main outside of the premises, nor can it find any unclearness in the policy language that can be reasonably interpreted in a way that affords coverage. This court therefore finds that in the instant matter, Travelers has made a prima facie showing that its exclusion applies; namely, that the stoppage in question was in pipes off the insured premises which resulted in back up therein and required the clearing of the outside city sewer main to dislodge. The absence of material facts to contradict that showing was borne out by the deposition of the owners of the premises, DEP personnel, and a retained engineer, whereas the points raised by Sephardic amount to little more than conjecture and semantics that do not persuasively raise any material issues of fact. Accordingly, Travelers' motion for summary judgment is granted and Sephardic's denied. This constitutes the decision and order of this Court.

Remember us,
on the platform, sitting on luggage
with our Casios and sweaters
playing hand-games, picking flat cigarette butts
and having mother scrub their soot off our fingers
with gruff tissue. Then recall
how we'd grope the bags like birthday gifts,
feeling for snacks, the biscuits you proudly packed.
Then, tugging father's sleeves, you asked:
""Are there cows in Malaysia?"". A nod triggered
a glimmer of milk teeth, and you peering at the rails
that stretched into the infinite night. Such moments:
sleepy footsteps, a passing boy's yawn, the water-stained pebbles,
forgave us for what we were,
mistaking the train's hoot for a far-flung moo,
the thresh of its wheels for a clamour of bells.

II
There was a man, in a PVC jacket,
and shades petalled with fingerprints,
vampiring marlboros, oozing
phantoms. Cheekless and cheerless
he clutched a brown PVC bag
with a yellow-nailed hand as mottled
as the bag. The ring on his finger
gawked at us like the eye
of a crocodile.

There was a woman,
green-eyebrowed, self-permed,
who beat her son for peeling
skin off his lips. When he bawled,
the speckled sores stretched open
and cried like little mouths.

We shrank a little,
but never found it in our hearts

Happiness tears, rеgrets from hell
Decеmber First now, comes again
December First's coming again
I apologized
More than twice
I apologized
But now I pay the price

I gave it all
But wasn't sacrifice at all
Yes, all the things that we do for love

I just wanted you to stay
We both leave it all in that way
I'm sorry

You just wanted me to say
You just wanted me to say
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

And, you don't even have to rush
Because that is the only way it goes
And yes, I loved you so much

There are things you don't forget
These are mine but now
The rest of my life I will regret
The winter's coming, ice and cold
Remind me of the date
December First comes again
Nostalgic tears, regards from hell
December First now comes again
December First's coming again

Again

No, no, no, no
No, no, baby, no baby, no
No, no, no
Ohh, ohh

And memories will flash my brain
I would stop them right now
They make me cy, they make me strain
I'm falling down, my feet are coming down touching the land
December First comes again
Nostalgic tears, regrets from hell

December First now comes again
December First's coming again

Her smiles, her frowns

Surely I could always be that way again
And yet

Accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

A weapon in each fist
The first blow makes the helmet crack

Covered in blood and brains
Leave the body lying dead

Yet more blood will be shed

Twila Heckard: Good evening, this is Twila Heckard and welcome to Black Line.  Tonight we’re coming to you live via satellite from the South Central hill.  Right now we’re talking with Motown recording artist MC Trouble
Twila Heckard: Good evening Trouble, I’d first like to say that it’s a pleasure having you here this evening
MC Trouble: Thank you, it’s a pleasure being here
Twila Heckard: I’d like to ask you how does it feel being Motown’s first female rap artist?
MC Trouble: Well there are more important things we could discuss
Twila Heckard: Well what would you like to discuss?

MC Trouble: Issue one let’s tackle the racism
Decays the minds who call it the [?] of Nubian descent
I love my brothers, but being pro-peace I see no colors
Shout “down with the hunger, up with the giving”
“Down with the [?], up for better livin”
“Down with the homelessness, down with the drugs”
“Up with the shelters, down with the thugs”
Every man rise, down with the giving up
Everyone shout for Congress’ pay cut
So call me a nigga?  How would you figure if I called you a cracker?
Would it matter?

People of all races, finding in the middle of places
Evil has set to down us, take a look around us
Twila Heckard: OK, well anyway, enough of that.  Um I’d like to ask you, how was it growing up in south central Los Angeles?
MC Trouble: How do you think it was?
There are people on the street with nothing to eat
Nowhere to live, no shoes on their feet
The president stays a 500 plus suites with the taxpayers’ money
Now who’s the cheat?
I think of the mess, it only makes me frown
I see a hungry child, his wife in a hundred-thousand-dollar gown
People in the station can’t read or write
While million-dollar bombs are built, just for the fright and destruction of another human
Which is a whack ass plan, people on the streets, just begging for a buck
But Congress gets a race war and job with food
Now I’m not afraid to speak my mind
I’m looking forward to a better day for mankind
I want a safe world, where my kids can play
And educate all that white versus black can only equal gray

[Skit]
Twila Heckard: OK Trouble, I take it that those are your opinions on such issues
MC Trouble: Yes, they are my opinions, but not just my opinions, they’re fact
Twila Heckard: Oh darn, would you look at that?  Unfortunately, we are out of time Trouble.  I’d like to thank—
MC Trouble: Yeah, I thought you would say that, but yo, hold up chill.  I’m not finished saying what I have to say.  Don’t ever interrupt me, you die. Now...

Issue three—all men created equal and God wants peace for all people
Yet we fight, for ignorance to know wrong from right, when we should unite
Shout “down with the negative, up with the positive”
Down with the racism, up with the unity
Down with the ignorance, up with awareness
Up with the caring, down with the careless
Up with the sharing, down with the stingy
Up with the better, down with the dingy
Minds that corrupt the world
Let’s make a better place for our boys and girls
Get a grip before the world decays
With toxic waste, where will our children play?
With the building of bombs, when will the government grow up?
When it blows up will we end up

[Skit]
Studio Producer: Get her off the show. Jesus!  Let’s go to commercial
Twila Heckard: OK I’d like to thank you for joining us, we are out of time now. Read my lips, we are definitely out of time now
MC Trouble: Shut up!  Have one more thing to say.  Think about it, life ends then no [?].  So who in the hell wins?
Twila Heckard: OK, this concludes our show for the evening.  We’d like to thank MC Trouble.  This is Twila Heckard signing off for Black Line.
Studio Producer: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot
Executive Producer: Who’s responsible for this?
Studio Producer: I think Heckard booked her on the show
Executive Producer: I want Heckard in my office now
Twila Heckard:  I am not responsible for this. I knew this was a bad—
Executive Producer: Heckard!
Studio Producer: Those rappers man, I tell you they are a lot of trouble

People try to down us, take a look around us
People of all races, behind the [?] places
People sent to down us, take a look around us
Take a look around us
Take a look around us

The nation is sick, trouble is in the land…

Ayy, wait, I'm on the block, lil’ nigga you stupid
Hit him in the heart nigga like he Cupid
Niggas they talk but niggas won't do it
I just bought a Glock, I can't even use it
I spin his block, nigga in a Chevy
Pull up on the opps, but ´they wasn’t ready
I'm in the cut, nigga getting digits
Just get on your knees bitch, I want the bag
Just get on your knees bitch, I want the neck
I'm in the cut trappin' with a vest
I'm with my dawg, nigga Johnny test
Watch how I walk nigga, watch your step
Huh, wait
Made that money flip
Niggas talking shit, I had enough of it
Wait, got a hunnid choppas and a hunnid clips, ayy
Wait, that's your bitch she thottin' but you cuffin' shit
Ayy, wait, I’m on the block, lil’ nigga go crazy
Totin' the Glocks that clip a whole 80
I got the big guns like the Navy
Watch how I skrr off in a Cedes
Watch how I skrr off in a Lambo
I got the big guns like I’m Rambo
I got a bad bitch goin' commando
Everything lit nigga like a candle

We are where we belong
Safe places, warm faces
All have been gone too long
Sky writing, inviting
Disappears amidst the cloud
False promise, the last cold kiss
All seem so distant now
Just with each other
We are all so well armed
And with a little care we need
Never be harmed
We've got we and there's love
Before our eyes
We can have it and hold it
If we realize
But just with each other
We are, we are so well armed
And with a little care we need
Never, no never be harmed

Filled with so much anger
How could anyone ever love me
Or at least that's what every ex lover said to me
Maybe I have a problem
They were of me
They said I need help
They said I'm sick
Out of control
You want the truth
Well the truth is
Deep down I'm just angry
I hear the Devil hum inside of me
A tune we all know
Make the best and hum along
To a tune we all know
I'm sorry you don't trust me
But that's your own damn fault
Your guilty conscience got the best of you
And now you can't cope
How can you sleep at night with the things you've done
You accuse me of everything
I've never done anything to you
At the end of the day
You made me this way
I hear the Devil hum inside of me
A tune we all know
Make the best and hum along
To a tune we all know
I know I'm not a bad guy
But you make me feel insane
I know I'm not a bad guy
But you make me feel insane
Maybe I have a problem
Maybe I'm insane
Maybe I have a problem
Maybe you made me this way
Now my mind is racing
And I'm beginning to think that you were right

Or maybe I need some sleep

I can't be crazy

Ok, So I'm not your favourite rapper right
But I still got that hungry rapper appetite
You think we fake like cartoons right
You don't think we real? Why don't you call us mighty mites
And I can't stand a racist, wow, I'm such a hypocrite
It's probably me I'm chasing...
No it would not be me I'm chasing
That's just an understatement
Cause all these players think they Jason
Came in the game so quick I bet it's pregnant
Shout out to C cause he's smart but he do dumb stuff
Kinda like me when I'm driving that 'not dumb' huff
And I never emptied a dumb clip
You're speechless now, but I was never a dumb kid
Break your jaw now, easy as an alligator
So you can't talk your hypocriticism later
Rome got burnt down it wasn't rebuild in a day
Building from the ground up but your building the wrong way
If first you got tired, so then you got fired
My skin colour's calcium but your milk has expired
And when your finished and done with the drama
I don't complain about family, I've got a pretty cool mama
I ain't bragging, I'm just giving the facts
I don't end life with periods, I'mma end it with a comma
Finish this like the Lord of the Rings
End it mid sentence - leave everyone complaining
I'm just kiddin'
My lifes like an auction whos next for biddin'?
Like lost ark you lost parts and lost heart
And dodged darts in Dodge Darts in carparks
At Carleton not Carleton but Hallmarks
Same team to slip stream in mall carts
Stop shopping you're lifting out the top lane
Top dropping you're sifting out the crop grain
New name new rain grew Rogain
You plain while playin' your doubles you too same
Fly like brown bubbles- Aero...plane
Tame, lame, you of the few game
In a vicious circle now, got a new rhyme scheme
In a vicious circle now, in a new mind frame
A new strain of a pathogen attacking you
Not even that quick but even still I'm passing you
Critics be critiquing but I wasn't even asking you
Don't try to deny it the truth is stranger to you
Stranger than fiction and a stranger to you
Simple as that I gotta get this through to you
My point is to point out the that you don't speak the truth
Write the truth, find the proof, blind the youth
No
You who do without it
That's the truth
Get a clue but I've already got one
Say the flow's bad, what flow? I ain't got none
Don't need it when the clock stops to stop one
Say I treat the girls to nice but I ain't got none
Why? I gotta get them when the spots come
Why? I can't end up like Don Juan
Why? I gotta focus on being the top one
Spitting with a swollen lip but not a swollen head
I've gotta get the dough so, a needle pulling thread
The rays are on me give a word up to the head
8 strokes, sorry Carl, Caddyshack is dead
Broke the chain of unfortunate events
I'm chilling in a castle while you're sleeping out in tents
So you the dude who's chill yeah your toes icy
Your brain froze too you really are dense
It ain't snowing but you're looking through a white lens
White car, white man, white picket fence
Don't worry why you looking so tense?
White scar, white lamb, white picket fence

In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?

Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted

Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more

It echoes all through the hills

A soldier lies wounded still

And for freedom I'll say goodbye""

3433,"It happened rather suddenly that the Preacher came to town
With stories from the Testaments of men of great reknown
With his box of patent medicines he swore to cure all ills
From the lameness in the horses, to the children's colds and chills
And he had along his Indian wife and a country music band
Who sang of peace and brotherhood beside the Rio Grande

Now the Preacher quickly gathered sick and poor from miles around
Who came to him for comfort and to hear his country sound
But the mayor thought he was trouble when he spoke against the law
And he saw the growing power of the crowds that he could draw
And he worried when the Preacher bought himself a plot of land
To settle with his family beside the Rio Grande

The saloon was pretty crowded and the stakes was a-running high
And the girls sang sentimental songs that made us cowboys cry
We began to criticise the Preacher marrying a squaw
And how could he associate with cripples, drunks and whores
And in a crazy fit the Preacher scattered chips and winning hands
And condemned it as a den of vice beside the Rio Grande
Now the boys were drunk and rowdy, and mostly pretty mean
And we dragged him to the sidewalk and whipped his shoulders clean
We said he was responsible for bringing on the drought
That had burned off all the spring grass and had wiped the young herd out
The sheriff would not get involved, the law could take no hand
The Preacher had not harmed a soul

We pegged him on the hillside alongside two Apache braves
Who'd been given picks and shovels and been made to dig their graves
And when he asked for water stood and pissed around his feet
While his tongue swelled up and blackened in the burning desert heat
And someone said we ought to mark the Preacher with a brand
To show that he did not belong beside the Rio Grande

Then the sky began to darken and a breeze whipped up the dust
And some of us were frightened while others swore and cursed
And the Preacher said a few words with his final dying breath
About forgiving us for what we had done to bring about his death
And as the night began to fall we covered him with sand
And left his weary bones to bleach",pop

Where flowers have O's and X's have wings

So you jump from the Lord's Supper passage to the ""I AM"" statements?
That's weird, facts

[Verse 1]
Jesus said He is the Vine (HE ain't lying)
But that passage is a different kind (No parallel)
Than the Supper one He instituted (They not related)
Don't believe me, okay, let me prove it (What HE say then?)
Jesus took the bread and said that this his body (Did HE not?)
Then he took the cup and told them this his blood (Read it, read it)
If he's holding bread and wine and use the word is (Look it up)
In that sentence please show me where is the metaphor (I'll wait, I'll wait)
The only move you got is to re-define (Only move)
What is means, to say it symbolizes (That's it, oh)
Now you're changing words, changing definitions (Okay)
I thought you were Sola Scriptura, ain't that your position (Switchin')
Oh, that's right, you're modern man (Ta-ta-da-daa)
You reject the fathers and the rules of grammar then (That's right)
The enlightenment, sheesh, it finessed us all (We cocky)
We are rejecting Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul
Wow!
[Chorus]
Jesus is the Great I Am
See the parallels
Jesus the Passover Lamb
Did they eat the lamb
Yes yes, they ate the lamb (Literally)
Did they eat the lamb
Yes yes, they ate the lamb
For real

[Verse 2]
Jesus said I am the Vine
Jesus said I am the door (T-H-E)
Interpret this the way you want to do it
Got the Scriptures saying Jesus represents the door
But that don't make sense does it
Jesus is the Vine
He is the life source
And the way to get to God
Plus He said ""The"" vine
Not ""a"" vine
Some random vine
Some random door, better be careful making metaphors
Plus He said I am the way, the truth, and life (the Light)
Resurrection and the life, I'm the bread of life
Want to make the ""I Am"" statements the symbolic type
Like ""I Am"" that ""I Am,"" that's denying Christ
Yes he used some symbolism here to make his point
Don't miss his point, to the truths though to which they point
These passages are not parallel with the other
He's not holding objects up like the Lord Supper

Jesus is the Great I Am
See the parallels
Jesus the Passover Lamb
Did they eat the lamb
Yes yes, they ate the lamb (Literally)

I’m so real, my authenticity is contagious
Going hard since I was born, never in hiatus
I’m going no ceilings, while you’re still stuck in the basement
I’m a missile in the sky, the military’s got me in surveillance
I’m floating on cloud nine, no gravity like I’m weightless
Walking around with shades, because maybe I’m that famous
Went to a restaurant hungry and left with the waitress
When I go, I’m on girls like fragrance
Both you and your music like to take it up the anus
Getting all the awards, it’s a yearly basis
If you tried to walk in my shoes, you’d struggle tying the laces
I could spit my entire life like its Les Mis
If you did that, then you’d be the definition of what lame is
My rapping got me a reputation, yours made you more of a vagrant
LONG LIVE MONEYYYY, I’m ancient and I’m ageless

I’m killin it, blood spillin’ in villians
Ballin with skill and I’m spitting ill feelings
Spitting verses, like I’m in churches, I’m taking down every hater
This the purges, this the purges
Living for a reason, spitting for a purpose, taking haters down
This the purges…
Sitting on the throne, I make it reign
Making cash money, like I’m Bruce Wayne
I’m living a life, that you can’t even maintain
Got so many girls, some even got the same name
Demolishing haters in the way, like a hurricane
She likes me ‘cause I’m smart, she came for my brain
She bought a ticket, and then rode the train
If she was the basket . . . all I did was drain
I’m a rapper that’s mastered all the elements
Gamebattlefilms1? I’ll win this battle with my regiment
When your girl be in my crib, that’s when she puts her phone on silent
I pulled her strings, now I play her like a violin
You’re talking all this crap, you need a piece of gum
Ya feel me? Because if you don’t it’s your fault for being numb
Got your girl feeling all type of way, not just some

Typical white kid, khaki shorts and leather sperries
Got limited knowledge, with limited vocabulary
Probably lived to the age of 12 believing in the tooth fairy
I’m the truth, I bury
The lies from you, it’s scary how it varies but trust me it’s the juice, it’s cherry

Time flies when it shines bright
My wings are money in a dimes sight
My sky lies in my minds eye
Looking out at a fine night
No pyramid in my skyline
No neon green in my high lights
My stars aligned at the right time
Telescopes on my hindsight
Got rule books on my guidelines
Learn rocket science in my scyfi
Toy with nasa like eye spy
You got no help verse einstien
Im like him but with five minds
Your the titanic with hightide
Within the bermuda triangle of my life
Im dead to yall that ship sailed
The ocean stops when I inhale
Blind to greed but money talks
So I hear sign language and spit braile
People talking like they know me
People talking like we homies
But im responding like im lonely
So people talking like the old me
People just hate to change
They so focused to make it rain
With clouded thoughts engraved in pain
Blood brothers dont say my name in vein
Respect is earned can't change that game
I guess I did when you gave the reigns
Or maybe its women when the labor came
Or maybe it was slaves when they paid with chains
History written by the white man
Present day living in the right scam
Tommorrow in the sorrow of the fight plan
Destiny manifested into a nightmare
With no religion im dream chasing
With no revision im speed racing
With no remission can't be patient
With no sedition yall need saving
Im still shook people love trump
White lies but hes above none
A cardinal sin looks down to judge one
A feather drops and that becomes us
Stand up with the motivation
To fight for those who have no relation
Be weary of snakes who grow evasive
If rap needs me this my ode to save it
I just wanna live in my own world
With no power junkies watching thrones twirl
Be real catching feelings for a home girl
Who'd trade a thousand diamonds for a lone pearl
Im further than the diamond in the rough
The coal within your stocking cuz the shining ain't enough
Never under pressure till im climbing up the dust
Or im all up in your grill and you dining in disgust
Long wait bad service no tips
Cold food taste like its frozen
Caught up in the moment bar is still open
Watching out for small talk bartenders gold dig
No food for thought they eat your emotions
Dumbing it down theyre sweet when you go sit
On your mind out your mouth can't speak never notice
Cat got your tounge you can leave when its potent
Never been the guy to accept his fate
Always had the drive no second base
When home I arrive so affectionate (nate)
When the message I slide on collection plates
Verdict still out if you take my pitch
If its a hit then you hate my whip
Getting all these kays(Ks) can erase my grip
Im letting go so you can place your shift
Society filled with hannah bakers
13 tapes whats the wrost that can happen?
We shed no light no hannah saver
I guess you can say we never baker acted
We always overlook the suicide
But what if in every mind its do or die?
That would change the perspective of you and I
Then you go turn around telling stupid lies
Dont be concerned over who listens
The outcome shouldn't make you different
Balling hard put you on a new mission
Cuz cinderella getting her shoe fittted
And if the shoe fits then wear it
Your life made of glass who cares then?
Not you not me not even your parents
Never failed never tried to me thats embarrased
Dont live your life by what ifs
The smartest adults were dumb kids
Michale jordan once on the cutlist
Then no matter you equate to something

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me

Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Shout-out all my exes, get your brag on
Your Chanel, your Céline, mean bag on
Get your swag on
If he don't act right, I'ma act [wrong/raw]
'Cause you was that type to put me back on, real one
Fuck how them niggas feel, they wasn't worth a chill
They wasn't worth a mill, when they payin' the bills?
YSL is your heel, know you better than that
And you never was whack, always ahead of your pack
You was something to chase that flew up in the ranks
Used to run in the banks, I gave you nothin' but thanks
Every color in cakes
Pump, pump it up
Button open the gate, townhome come with a lake
It ain't over, you wait
Bae, you know you a star
And one-up wit' your broads, [?] Audemars
Bartenders, they know who we are
They know where it's dough, ain't gotta blow it, they ball
They just go to the car, then we goin' across
Stones goin' across like Jesus go on the cross
I could tell you sad, yo' glowin' is off
You know that you hot, that's why I be blowin' you off
'Cause you a vet ma, love how you flex, ma
Pushin' the vet, ma
Hoodie is Vetements
Gucci tights and heels, Amiri sweats, huh?
No efforts to dress, huh?
I'm definitely impressed
Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
I be out in LA wit' my connection
Bottles of Belair, hoes in my section
I won't lighten up on these niggas
'Cause niggas ain't nice enough for me, nigga
I been a beast
Heavy orders for weeks
Breakin' quarters for cheap
On these corners is street shit, every mornin' was sweet
Last winter, bought a mink for my daughter and niece
Once I caught it and beat shit, I'ma throw it to East

Your boy! (I had!)

If we talkin' 'bout women, I keep a bad one
Mami a freak, you can't relate if you never had one
She told me you actin' light skin
We just be fuckin', I can't be wifin'
Always textin' me, she keep typin'
Her ex from Harlem, she told me he went to Rykes
And I been movin' so triflin'
Fuckin' everything movin', I'm breakin' nights
My aura converting dykes, we fuck to ""What's The Price""
Off the Migo album, Miami not like Barbados
She never seen an island
She tried to ask me 'bout paper, told her I keep it pilin'
I might even eat it, long as you keep it silent
Got the nerve to tell me she got to be nice for work
I ain't want you anyway, I just liked your butt
Actin' all stuck-up, ain't livin' life enough
Tryna be in our section, you 'bout to spend a night wit' us
Middle of the summer, we keepin' it calm
'Wit a chick like Stacey Dash or Lela Rochon
Full lift in the winter, that shit be keepin' her warm
Panties get pulled to the side, fuck it, she keepin' 'em on
After the neck I got respect, I might speak to her mom
Said she from Highbridge, I caught her creepin' wit' Don
She got everything Gucci, said she need some Vuitton
She know the kid rich, might new freezer her arm
Told me she stressed out, just need to smoke one
She got her nails did, got her toes done
She told me life been rough wit' these niggas
She pour a cup and like to fuck off the liquor

Just spray it like an old hog
After a prolonged mow of the whole yard
I think y'all know what the fuck I'm saying
But I might seem crazy
Just understand that I know I can spit flames
Caucasian monster
Muster up the courage to rage at the concert
Spades up on my shirt
Fuego so hot and juicy, he'll need some milk at the Oscars
I got reversed
So I laid Draw Two
And made them pick
They stack thе cards screamin'
No Draw Four and fuck you bitch!
Everybody sees that I'm made for this
Jabеz Z equals greatness
Just look at me, ugly as ever
But hot when I spit the rhymes so clever
I've waited so long, just to spit this shit
The most random ass shit to spit
I'll rhyme spit with spit all day

You know how hard i worked
You think im going to quit
You know how many fake people i dealt with

[ Hook: Kris Prince ]
I done came from the bottom
I then dealt with depression
I had low self esteem
I was broke i was desperate
[Middle finger to the depression]

Then i rose from the bottom
Then i overcame depression
Then i built my self esteem
Now its time to reap my blessings

(Had to get it on my own
Had to seperate the business
Got it off of my ambition
Now its time to reap my blessings)
Turned into a legal savage
I became a legal savage

I Had to seperate the business
I Got it off of my ambition
Now its time to reap my blessings (Yeah)

All that hate it did me damage
Remember when i didn't have it
Now a nigga living lavish
I wish a nigga would try it
Cuz They dont know im micheal myers
Ill make your mission suicide
For people thinking that im lame
For niggas thinking its a game
Like Mario them bullets flying (DODGE THAT)
I know you see it im my own boss
Dripping swag cooking soul got my own sauce
Keep a rosary around my neck
Wear another for the double cross
Walk around with my conceal to carry
Move in silence, keep my hands Clean
Kill the game imma do it the right way
Fuck the trap imma sell it the legal way

And four she cannot brook
The godly Agur counted them
And put them in a book --
Those Four Tremendous Curses
With which mankind is cursed;
But a Servant when He Reigneth
Old Agur entered first.
An Handmaid that is Mistress
We need not call upon.
A Fool when he is full of Meat
Will fall asleep anon.
An Odious Woman Married
May bear a babe and mend;
But a Servant when He Reigneth
Is Confusion to the end.

His feet are swift to tumult,
His hands are slow to toil,
His ears are deaf to reason,
His lips are loud in broil.
He knows no use for power
Except to show his might.
He gives no heed to judgment
Unless it prove him right.
Because he served a master
Before his Kingship came,
And hid in all disaster
Behind his master's name,
So, when his Folly opens
The unnecessary hells,
A Servant when He Reigneth
Throws the blame on some one else.

His vows are lightly spoken,
His faith is hard to bind,
His trust is easy boken,
He fears his fellow-kind.
The nearest mob will move him
To break the pledge he gave --
Oh, a Servant when he Reigneth
Is more than ever slave!",misc

But when we kiss it doesn't taste the same
I'm not that mad if I'm being honest

I knew it wouldn't last that long
'Cause you always treat the right girl wrong

They say you are who you are when no one’s watching
Well I’ve been low when you’ve been popping
You’re focused, you’re smart, your career with options
And sexy is just the topping, I’m feeling you
Was hoping I could take you out for a meal or two
Some chit chat to find you what’s the deal with you
Oh you’re single, but you don’t do talk
Especially no dudes from New York, we’re so odd
Momma put it in your mind we was no good
Bestie tell you all the time how she going through it
All the drama, and you don’t want it
We living it like we own it, I get that
But I ain’t looking to just hit it and quit that
Take my math, when you get it, mean it, get back
Ha, she looking like “sure, you right”
I’m looking like “bet you call the night
Bet you override”

But don’t overthink it, I told you, lady
Huh, I want to get to know you maybe
You feel my approach is crazy
I’m out of my mind, but I can’t get you out of my mind
And the thoughts of you consume a lot of my time
Got a lot on my mind I want to do
And all I need is opportunity and you
I told you right
Girl, you really need to override
Everything that you thought ain’t come overnight
Let me hold you tight, you gon’ stay
And be my WCE, that’s everyday

When I’m alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
And think of you pinned against it, we getting it on
While I’m getting you off, I’m on top
You telling me to do everything except stop
We drop and roll, it’s a fire we cannot control
I’m in deep past your cervix and served ‘til I got your soul
Lock and load and then bang
I’m telling you let’s do it again, you can’t hang
But that’s just the fantasy
Daydreaming on the canopy
It’s so simple, how can it be
I’m just candidly waiting, can’t stand to be patient
Singing girl, can’t we get this started, I’m so anxious
To make a move on your heart, it’s so vacant
And you’ve had a change of heart, it’s so blatant
Working overtime, trying hard not to coincide
On the ride over ‘bout to override

And it came to me on the 12th day of the 8th month and all he said was “hello”
A hello that graciously swam inside my ears while my eyes drowned inside his soul
He approached me as if I was the treasure to his gold
As if he knew I would be pleased with the cadence and just his stroll alone
So I stared, gazing at the stars even more intrigued
When he acknowledges our constellations in the galaxy
He seems to know how the universe works
So I have to ask him, will he ever say hello again?
Only three seconds in and I’ve been blown like the wind
He feels familiar we’re kin
Elevating so high, we collide like hydrogen
See, hearing his voice illuminates my mind’s eye
Vibrates within my spine
And he sounds even better when he’s electrified
With love, love himself
And I wouldn’t expect him to be anyone else
Hello
This time, say it slow
I can feel it in his smile, he appreciates my glow
So I asked his favorite color, he says yellow
And before I can shake my next sentence
He screams solar plexus which lets me know he’s in tune with his reflexes
And I find it astounding how he, he knows I’m that kind of lady
Eclectic, yet sometimes I’m called crazy
But he, him, his simple hello, charged my [?] with hopes that I’ll soon see him again
But only time, only time will know
Only time will know",rap

Gamble with my freedom, yeah I risk it
Listen I was so broke nigga, Felix couldn't fix it
But then I fixed it, time to get down to business
I could make a movie, all this shit that I’ve witnessed
Passed the clouds man, I'm aiming for space
For them days when I was locked, when I was fading away
Try get in and then get out, yeah that's the aim of the game

And my iPhone, so they know that I ain't at home

I just dropped a new tune, should be doing interviews
I had to cancel shows in Leeds, Manny and Liverpool
The whole world stood stiff just like a mannequin
And toilet paper’s a myth cause we was panicking
""2020 gon’ be lit"", now that's a dud statement
Cause everybody’s in their cribs looking frustrated
No raves to attend
And Boris hit the screen to tell us to stay away from our friends
I don't know if it's the 5G or COVID-19
All I know is imma pray that it ends
Right now I should be hitting up a carnival
Or in the park with my niggas and a barbecue
Is it true what they're saying on the news?
Got us queuing up for food from a tiny little particle
I swear I miss the gym, need to get a trim
Wish that I could take my kids for a little swim
I swear I’m sick of this shit
They say we need a vaccination to get rid of this shit
I need a trip, I'm missing flying Meadows and copping a little drip
Got me thinking about casino, guess I'm stuck with these chips
Walking with a mask like I'm about to go and hit a lick
Everybody off the streets, that's what the feds want
I'm reminiscing about us eating in a restaurant
Now I'm flicking through my Snapchat and Instagram
My son's kinda pissed cause we had to cancel Disneyland
But staying cautious is my best precaution
My pops is worried so he's extra cautious
He cooked some food and made an extra portion
It's in the garden, I can't step towards him
I called him up, I'm at the fence approaching
Burglaries are down cause everybody's in their house

Won’t you be my queen, no dairy just liquor
She’s my overdose let me pop 10 pills
Feeling so numb i don’t know what’s real
Touching cloud nine with that purp in my lungs
Inhale exhale scooby on my tongue
Bitch im going fast
I think i’m gonna crash
Running fast like flash
I think i gotta dash
Loud pack on the dash, won’t you come and smoke it fast
Spending cash on my stash that turn to ash
Ice on my wrist, ice in my veins
Guess i’m sub zero i got ice in my brain

Hate me, Hate me, demon girl
In my blue suit I try and save your world
You a pill pop shawty, girl you better call somebody
Shot thru the heart, now you caught a fucking body
Damned from the start, now I’m in an autopsy
Heartbreak boulevard, that’s where you drop me
Sippin on Hennessy, that’s my therapy
Smoking on medically, that’s my remedy
Thought we were meant to be
Turned to be differently
Turned to my enemy
Had my ￼￼epiphany
Don't want your empathy
Don't want your sympathy
Look what you did to me
Got me singing melodies

Got me singing melodies
You got me singing melodies
So fucking frozen
You got me
So fucking frozen

Ignite a fuse. A fake smile is guilty

""It's booming today!"", I'm forcing that
After emptily crossing ourselves, now, here we go, okay? stand up! Ready?
Dance on deadline

Change the weekend to the world's end [ Week End ⇒ World's End ]
Shockingly a circus without end is repainting the night

Isn't it time God even got sound sleep?
No prayers will be answered

You got lost in the crushed night and your anxious face looks adorable, too
Why don't we forget everything and play?
If you'd like to, go crazy now and comе to this side like me
Lеt's whoop it up till we burn out

Ride it on the count of three. How's that? You're about to fall, right?
Balancing on a ball is really unsteady, just like you heart
You're falling, the eyesight is going around
Till you land alive, now struggle! stand up! Baby?
Make a deadline

Everyone from boys and girls [ Boy'sEnd ⇔ Girl'sEnd ]
Suddenly they're taken away by the worst night and their games will be over

If you open the box, a lovely bunny will appear?
Are you kidding? Something in the box is just despair

Bullets of poor shrieks that were shot, screamed and flown away
Acted like crowns somehow , hit and disappeared
It's an amusing deadline circus. Shall we indulge in a facetious dream?
Sing about the random night!

You there, why don't you also stand on the stage?
Just a while ago, a person who acted as a pierrot has just turned into ashes... no, I mean
The one has just disappeared. Now, welcome!

You got lost in the crushed night and your anxious face looks adorable, too
Why don't we forget everything and play?

If you'd like to, go crazy now and come to this side like me
Let's whoop it up, come on! Lady!

Little boy
In a baseball hat
Stands in the field
With his ball and bat

And says, ""I am the greatest
Player of them all""
He puts bat on his shoulder
And he tosses up the ball

[Chorus 1]
And the ball goes up
The ball goes down
He swings his bat
All the way around

The world's so still
You can hear the sound
As the baseball falls
To the ground
[Verse 2]
Now the little boy
He doesn't say a word
He picks up his ball
He is undeterred

Says, ""I am the greatest
There has ever been""
And he grits his teeth
Then he tries again

[Chorus 1]
And the ball goes up
The ball goes down
He swings his bat
All the way around

The world so still
You can hear the sound
As the baseball falls
To the ground

[Bridge]
He makes no excuses
He shows no fear
He just closes his eyes
And listens to the cheers
[Verse 3]
A little boy
He adjusts his hat
Picks up his ball
Stares at his bat

And says, ""I am the greatest
The game is on the line""
And he gives his all
One last time

[Chorus 2]
And the ball goes up
Like the moon so bright
And he swings his bat
With all his might

The world so still
As still can be
And the baseball falls
And that's strike three

[Outro]
And now it's supper time
And his mama calls
The little boy starts home
With his bat and ball
And says, ""I am the greatest
That is understood""

Yeah, even I didn't know
That I could pitch that good",country

Was given all but knowledge but he wanted that as well

Who hid himself when he was called
Who was the one submitting to sin with a sigh

Well was it Peter Judas Adam or me
Well was it Peter Judas Adam or me
Sometimes I read it but I don't know who I see
If it is Peter Judas Adam or me
Heaven's king come down

Some friend some kiss
Sentiment a sign of love now symbolising death
Who was the one who did betray our precious Lord
Who counted riches more than God
Who was the one taking advantage of love

Always a friend
Life committed pledge of service til the end
Words are okay
But the heat of the moment melt those promises away
Who was the one who won't proclaim the name of God
Who time and time and time again denied our Lord
Who was the one serving the worst blow of all",pop

They had one good eye between them
They were burning up the sky
When I asked why they had come for me
The ugly one replied
He told me
Ah, you better recognize
Aw, you better recognize, son
Next thing I recall well
I was hanging from a cliff
When an angel came to rescue
Me and held me in her grip
She said, ""Everyone who's ever loved you
Gets hurt in the end.""
Then she smiled and said, ""Forgive me.""
As she let go of my hand
She told me

Ah, you better recognize

Ah, you better recognize, son
(Hip hip for all the busted, we are entrusted)
Ah, you better recognize

We can't hear you're on the list now!)
And let your dim light shine
Always darkest before the morning light
Lord knows you ain't that bright
Better let your dim light shine
Just before I hit the ground
I woke up in my bed
I was dazed and I was weary
And my heart was full of dread
When I looked at my reflection
I was horrified to find
There were seven horsemen next to me
The angel close behind
They told me

Ah, you better recognize

You're objectively observed as a problem to be solved
But it's not the doctor's fault for this distanced disposition
It's just the way things must go when you're in their position
Like a rope that hangs off the edge of a cliff
Trying to stop people from falling
When someone's life is on the line
You must maintain a state of mind that allows you to act
With precision
No inhibition

In the operating room
You will forcibly receive a deep and peaceful sleep
And when you awake
There may be
Rods reinforcing your broken bones
And holes in your body wrapped up and sewn
Though you may feel weak cold and alone
Those holes were put there to make you whole again
And as for the pain and discomfort you've experienced
Have faith that some day it will all come to an end
In the operating room
You may feel a sickness in your stomach
From nerves that make chills plummet
From your head to your toes then back again
You wonder why does this have to happen
All the hospital gowns and the bed pans
And the sleeping pills and the Vicodin
All this time spent doing nothing but trying to get better

In the operating room
There are successes and there are failures
It's a lot like being a sailor
Either you sink or your swim
And there are miracles and acts of God
And radicle treatments and stacked up odds
That miraculously turn out in your favor
But sometimes there is no savior",rock

Endless thank you's to the women who raised me
Try to keep my head cool though life keeps burning me
Sorry that I never learned how to respect authority, forgive me
Mother I swear that I'm a grown man
You taught me how to walk holding my pinky in your hand
30 years later, bearded, ready for whatever
They can hold me down for now but this won't last forever
Promise I'll be back and better
Fallen 40 stories only bled
Been trampled down and beaten, left for dead
Gambled and I lost
Gambled and I won
Don't think that i would ever take those bets back, none
From the bottom of my heart I believe in what we're doing
And don't care if it's unattainable I'll still pursue it
Oh my God I'm sorry for the sins that I was born with
But a life without a single sin is simply boring
Forgive me

Any minute now all could be gone
But I know together we're strong
Any minute now all could be gone
Stay strong
Stay strong
Adolescent rage still swimming through my veins
Knew this world was unfair at an early age
Mother, I know they never paid you a proper wage
So thank you doubly for every sacrifice you made

If we reach the end of days or i ever lose my way
I'll follow crumbs back to you and will never stray

Loved ones found
Loved ones lost
Just know that I will never forget any of them, none

They can lock me up for now but the seeds were still sown
And when i make it out I know that they'll be fully grown

Never gave a shit about a boss or president
If we want some real change we need to make it with our friends

Back when I was 10, sang ""Fuck the Police""
20 years later - know exactly what that means

They made it a sin to believe in equality
Called it criminal to fight in solidarity
To stop me they're gonna have to bury me

Any minute now all could be gone
But I know together we're strong
Any minute now all could be gone
But together we'll still be strong
Barely fucking breathing  I'ma keep fists swinging
Thank you Mother for teaching us to embrace our differences
Taught me to believe that everyone is worth the same
""They'll never take us out!""
I'll scream it till I hit the grave
I could give a fuck about another ephemeral trend
I'll never waste a single word trying to please them
One minute we're here
Next minute we're dead
It's all about how we will be remembered in the end
The end",rap

I fuck up on words, I think that I'm perfect

I damn near lose my mind off the shit that I be viewing
Like the same nails I screwing be the same ones I loosen
And that shit crazy

5923,"""Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am honoured to have been asked to speak to you this evening.

First, because you, who are my audience, are such distinguished supporters and servants of the game of cricket.

Second because the venue is Lord's - so steeped in history and as I shall explain, which a special place in my own history.

And third, because the lecture is named after a man who so reflected all that's special about it.

Of you, the audience, I would say simply this:

Many of you are involved in cricket administration and I know what an under-valued role that is. Players - driven as they are - understandably - but the single-minded realisation of their individual and collective talents - will probably always see administrators in an unsympathetic light.
But what you do - what I also now do - has to be done it will never achieve public acclaim - we will probably always have to be satisfied with knowing that the young and shining stars walk out upon a stage we helped to build. It may be the beginning of a test for them, but it is also the fulfilment of a longer and more complicated organisational journey that we have shared on their behalf.

Their prize is success and fame - ours the knowledge that we have helped cricket live on from one generation to the next.
Of this ground, Lord's, what can one say? Its beauty, its history and traditions, its rightful claim to be the home of the game all these things speak for themselves. I greatly admire the way MCC and its leadership have so well preserved not just the ground physically, but it symbolic role as the guardian of cricket tradition - of excellence, of collective contribution (teamwork) of discipline, and above all of integrity and fair play. And I applaud MCC's leadership of the Spirit of Cricket campaign.

In my professional career of over 20 years, with the West Indies and with Lancashire, I have experienced many magical moments at Lord's the most special being at nine in the evening on June 21st in 1975 when on the balcony, with my team-mates around me, and in front of thousands of jubilant spectators, I held aloft the World Cup. A special moment but not just special to me, or to West Indies crickets that inaugural World Cup was special for the game itself, because I believe it was at that point that all lovers of the game - free spirits and purists alike - accepted that it had changed, that there was now a fresh element that had come to stay, that one day cricket could, and was, adding a significant dimension to cricket without detracting from it.

And speaking of purists, let me for a moment reflect on that special purist - the pure stroke maker, the pure gentleman - who was Colin Cowdrey. You were right to name this Spirit of Cricket lecture after him, for he embodied all that was best in the game. As a young cricketer, and ultimately an opponent on the field, I was a great admirer of Colin - my liking and respect for him unaffected by the fact that he was the opposing captain in my first test series with England and led his team to a one-nil victory - one that owed as much to his inspiration of this team and the many runs he scored. It is noteworthy that three decades he remains England's most prolific batsman against the West Indies, scoring six centuries and over 1700 runs in 21 Tests.
But rather than lamenting the fact that he was our nemesis, I prefer to acknowledge with gratitude the many qualities he brought to the game. Some saw him as a gentle man, and in a way he was - but I remember, too the dedication, determination and mental toughness that under-pinned his batting; and the calm astuteness, the character and discipline he manifested as a leader. He may have been a generous man off the field but I can assure you he gave nothing away on it.

He was an equally significant contributor off the field. As a past chairman of the ICC he initiated the ICC Code of Conduct and the move to independent officials in test and one-day internationals. Without his work, my work as an international referee probably would not exist. He never promoted change for its own sake, but always with the aim of making the game better. And he did.

As a player and captain, I was greatly influenced by two men - Frank Worrell and Colin Cowdrey. Alas, Frank passed from time to eternity far too young; Colin, too, ended his innings too early. But their inspiration remains. And for me, it was more than just cricket - I was particularly honoured to succeed Colin as chairman of the Heavy Rollers - a vibrant organisation that provides disadvantaged kids in this country with the opportunity to enrich their lives by playing cricket a point I will return to later.

Mr President, in the essays of Montaigne it is written that ""the value of life lies not in the length of days, but in the use we make of them; a man may live long yet live very little."" Indeed, much to our chagrin, selfish though perhaps as I mentioned before, Sir Frank Worrell left us prematurely at age 42. But it is our good fortune that this reluctant hero lived his life in deeds and not years.

In his brief sojourn, Sir Frank used his gift of game to transform society in disrepair and left the world a better place. With purposeful astuteness, he parlayed his athletic gifts and joined the cricket field and political arena, and effectively eradicated the scourge of plantation-type snobbery that so characterised cricket and Caribbean life.
Sir Frank fiercely disliked the social conditions into which he was born and raised. And selflessly he embraced the daunting challenge of breaking down those fiendish barriers of colour and class. Through education he sought to ameliorate the human condition, and in the spirit of cricket he elevated the level of sportsmanship on playing fields throughout the world.

From Manchester to Melbourne, from Punjab to Port-of-Spain, Sir Frank enriched the life of millions whom he touched on and off the field. And I am honoured Mr President, to acknowledge that it is his informed leadership, his grace and dignity, and his relentless pursuit of equality and fair play, that inspired my captaincy of the West Indies team and fuelled my goals as a professional.

I aspired to continue the legacy of this legend as defined particularly by the epic 1960-61 West Indies tour of Australia, which epitomised the Spirit of Cricket and spawned the Frank Worrell Trophy - the symbol of cricket's supremacy between West Indies and Australia.

The late John Arlott - perhaps cricket's greatest, undoubtedly its most revered commentator and scribe - wrote that ""cricket is a game of many facets. If it is not all things to all men, at least it is different things to different men. They may see it as violent or pastoral, profound or shallow, romantic or pragmatic, graceful or harsh, dramatic or soporific, compelling or boring.""

Were he alive today, he could in current circumstances have added ""pure or political, alluring or discouraging"" - for these are challenging times for our game.
It is customary to talk about living in changing times, but when you think about it we are always living in changing times - what matters, as someone said, is that we ""adjust to changing times while holding to unchanging principles."" It is in protecting those principles that we face so much challenge today.

In discussing it, I will - perhaps not surprisingly - reflect a little of the concerns of my two predecessors as Cowdrey Lecturer - Barry Richards and Suny Gavaskar.

Barry talked of the growing inequalities between cricket-playing nations.

Suny talked of the growing problems of behaviour on the field.
I, too, will touch on these challenges - and others.

First there is the challenge of growth - and the danger of international inequality within the game.

From my vantagepoint, I have rejoiced in the growth of cricket across the globe while becoming increasingly concerned at some of the ramifications of both the proliferation of the game and its inevitable commercialisation.

I feel strongly that as more countries become involved in cricket, and young countries - in cricketing terms - come to the international test arena, there has to be greater fairness not just on the field but in the administrative and financial arrangements too.

Fairness on the field has little meaning of the teams are unfairly matched because of economic and social variances between their countries.

The ICC has performed miracles in broadening the scope of the game throughout the world; it is now vital that this vibrant organisation gives leadership to ensure the viability of the more economically challenged cricketing nations within its membership.

To that end, the ICC should effect and oversee the equitable distribution of funds - TV revenue, sponsorship, and other monies - between developed and under-developed countries. Currently countries such as my own West Indies are seriously disadvantaged and as a result infrastructural development and player development are falling behind. Despite individual exceptions, for sometimes great human character or talent overcomes all obstacles, there is a correlation between national economies and the performance of their sportsmen and women - it is inevitable. Year after year of disproportionate investment in players and facilities must ultimately lead to disproportionate levels of success. This cannot be good for a game that thrives on healthy competition and close contests between countries.

World cricket must decide whether it is to consist of occasional riveting battles between three or four super cricket nations - Australia, England and South Africa, obviously - and one-sided, poorly-attended intervening series between the strong and the weak, or whether it is prepared to do what is necessary to build up the number of competitive Test-playing countries. One way is by spreading the money within the game in order to help develop the facilities and talents of the newer competitors. The other is to create a sensible second tier of international cricket, perhaps build around regional competitions, so that they can slowly, but hopefully steadily move up to senior test status.

We should remember too the players - yes, they get much from the game but they also give the best years of their lives to it. As an international referee responsible for helping to maintain discipline and fair play within the game, I may seem to players from time to time to be an unsympathetic figure, but I have in fact much sympathy with the concerns they sometimes express. These are the stars of our game - the role models - the few upon whom so many in the game depend for its popularity and success.

They should be treated well. They should be communicated with as adults. They should be consulted on matters that affect them. They should be paid fairly to reflect their importance to the game, and the brevity of their careers. They should travel in comfort; there have to be better ways to save money than ask them to travel across the world in economy class. And thoughtful arrangements should be made for players' wives, families, and special guests attending international matches. The more we give to them, the more we can expect from them - and I believe the more we will get.

But, as I say, we have a right to expect something in return. Not only the expression of their playing talent but behaviour that makes them effective role models for the young and aspiring. Frankly, there is too much unnecessary posturing on the field, and I regret to say not enough honesty in acknowledging dismissals - or boundaries - and thus helping the umpires who they too easily criticise if they believe they have suffered from a bad decision.

That leads me to the second big challenge facing cricket - its to do with the laws and their enforcement.

As an international referee I myself represent one of the changes that has taken place in the game. Few know exactly what we do, so let me take a moment to explain, then raise some questions from my experience so far.
The ICC referee is the representative of the ICC at all test matches and one-day internationals.

It is assumed he is concerned about behaviour on the field. In fact, he is responsible for maintaining an overview on many aspects of the staging of the games - player safety, pitch and out-field preparations, facilities for umpires and officials, the standard of practice facilities, the adequacy of sightscreens, and so on.

But it is true that his primary responsibility is to ensure a fair and sportsmanlike game. Above all, he is there to ensure that the ICC code of conduct is upheld, to investigate and adjudicate upon alleged breaches of the rules, and if necessary apply appropriate sanctions to anyone found to be in breach.

He makes judgements on the basis of four levels of defined behaviour - from showing dissent or using offensive language to over racism, gambling, or attempted intimidation of officials.

A key role - and an area of special concern to me - is to contribute to the standard of umpiring.

The referee is not there to umpires and has no right to interfere with the role of the umpires under the laws of cricket. But he is there to help the umpires by maintaining an overview of how the game is being played that they, with their concentration ball by ball, cannot be expected to do.

It is also his role to assess and report on the performance of umpires. It is not only the tv commentators and audience who look closely at every decision; every appeal for a dismissal is recorded and viewed and detailed notes on the quality of the umpiring are kept so that the ICC is always working with umpires to improve performance.

Let me say that I have the utmost sympathy for these gentlemen. How many people have their minute-by-minute performance monitored by cameras and considered and reported upon, not by annual performance reviews, but on a daily basis - and that's after they have already been reviewed and commented upon on television in front of millions. There are times when one wonders why anyone would do it?

What I do believe is this: if technology is going to increasingly be used to reflect on the performance of the umpires - both by television and by officialdom - surely umpires should also have the opportunity to use it, to improve upon or supplement their performance.

How can it be right to ask an umpire to take a split-second decision based on his own eyesight and hearing while everyone else then judges (and, if justified - and sometimes when unjustified - criticises) that decision having made use of technology designed for the purpose?

It is time to use technology to the full extent. Umpires should be able to defer to the precision of Hawkeye, particularly in determining whether a batsman is lbw, whether there has been a bat-pad catch, and whether a batsman is caught behind the wicket where there's dispute over whether the ball has or has not been played.

I know there are problems about the time this will take, especially if a team is inclined to excessive appealing. But it should be possible to design restrictions on appealing, of the use of technology, monitored by the referee.

We should not delay any longer in acting on this. I believe there is overwhelming support for it. And it is in the interests of everyone, not just the umpires, but the players and public too.

Although we have some outstanding umpires on the international panel, the challenge of umpiring in today's conditions is greater than its ever been, and speaking frankly too many mistakes are being made. They're made not just because it's almost beyond human beings to make faultless decision when things happen so fast.

There is a lot at stake in international cricket these days; what matters is that we get it right - and if the technology will help, the technology should be used.
Another challenge arises from the need to maintain standards of behaviour on the field of play.

This varies. There have been recent series that have been a joy to referee, such has been the good-natured spirit in which they've been played.

There have been some that have been less satisfactory.

I know that last year, Suny Gavaskar expressed his concern about sledging and behaviour on the field. Before each match I talk to the captains and make it clear the ICC's view about how the game should be played. Once it begins, I keep the closest eye on this.

What I would say is that there has always been a bit of banter out there, and sometimes the frustration of a bowler whose appeal has been disallowed leads to a momentary lapse, and the players and the game are big enough to live with this.

But I agree with Suny that there is no need for nastiness, it is not necessary, it is not within the spirit of the game, and is best stamped out before ""the level of the bar"" drops and we find ourselves tolerating as ""business as usual"" behaviour that is foreign to the best traditions of the game.

In taking a firm line, referees are not being unnecessarily prissy - they are, I believe, reflecting what the game's players and supporters want.

Not are they there to make cricket less competitive. It should be hard-fought out there. There's a lot at stake.

I learned as captain of the West Indies the importance of winning - it is by winning that test teams rally their countries behind them, win sponsorship, and encourage the young to the game.

Some say to me that they find it surprising that I am a referee when I myself led the West Indies in an uncompromising way. But I did not believe then and I do not believe now that paying cricket in the right spirit means not playing it hard. It simply means playing it within the laws of the game and playing it honestly. I believe we always did.

I would like to touch on just one other area where reform is necessary. Over the past 15 years or so, one of the more revolutionary developments has been the day-night game. Undoubtedly, it has colour and commercial appeal. As a referee, however, I have to say that it does present the teams with starkly contrasting conditions, providing one with a considerable advantage - frankly, the difference between day and night. I believe, therefore, that such fixtures should not be scheduled for quarter-finals, semi-finals or finals. Once more, there's a lot at stake - at this level, fairness between teams must be paramount. It cannot be right that the game is settled with the toss.

Mr President, in recent years through the prism of our sport we have seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. As we contemplate the world today, we wonder whether cricket is not in fact a reflection of life. I referred earlier to John Arlott. He also wrote ""no sport runs deeper into life than cricket.""

As such, cricket has from time to time found itself on the cutting edge of progress - the very fact that it is being played becoming a reflection of peace between peoples.

Nowhere was this more so than in recent weeks when we saw the very best of cricket as India toured Pakistan for the first time in fourteen years. As the tour got underway, the Pakistan President expressed the hope that it would improve relations between the South Asian neighbours.

It was indeed a memorable moment in recent cricket history, although we should note that it was caused by the improved political relations between the two countries and only possible because the politicians decided to allow it. Still, it added to the improvement in relations between the two countries and we should be proud of that.

The issue of the cancellation of tours is, thank heavens, not one for referees, but it is one that has once more been placed firmly on cricket's agenda. I do not intend to take sides tonight, other, perhaps that to say that those who believe cricket tours can be influential for good - as they are perceived in Pakistan and India - must surely accept that, if they can have that influence, it must follow that there can occasionally be a converse side, too. It is tricky territory.

I do believe, however, that whatever one's view about the imposition of moral judgements into decision-making on tours, cricket should not isolate itself from the needs of the communities that live beyond its boundaries for it can do so much good.

Lord's is a leader in this respect, for who can but admire the outstanding charitable work of the Lord's Taverners?

I strongly recommend that the ICC and the entire international cricket fraternity become more involved in community outreach ventures and make their own contribution to improving the human condition whenever and wherever possible.

As cricket generates new wealth from increased commercialisation and the proliferation of the international game, so it can afford to share with those impoverished souls in our community, many of who live vicariously through their super-heroes in white.

I know you will join me in commending the Indian cricketers for arranging for a 10-year-old Pakistani girl suffering from cancer to received free treatment in India from three leading hospitals in Vellore, Bangalore and Bombay. Such a humanitarian gesture speaks volumes about the wider spirit of cricket and what it can do for the world.
In past days, it was taken for granted that touring sports teams would visit hospitals and schools and disadvantaged communities bringing a brief moment of attention and hope into their lives; cricket as well as our countries, would be better off it we could firmly re-establish that tradition.

Mr President, these are, as I have said, challenging days. But there is much to say that is good. As I've mentioned there's been the return to the cricket fields of the teams of India and Pakistan. In this country, there's been the fresh success of a young England team, and the success of Twenty20, a development that will without doubt find its place on the international stage.

And, around the world, big crowds continue to come, provided they believe they will see genuine competition.

And it's in the creation of genuine competition that the biggest challenge lies.

That will not happen by accident.

It means the strong helping the weak.

If they do, they will strengthen the whole international game.

If they do not, three or four countries will end up endlessly playing themselves - and everyone will lose patience with that.

This is a genuine case of helping the few being in the greater good.

In the meantime, let us at every level of the game embrace MCC's ideal of the spirit of cricket.

Let us exorcise the bad and the ugly.

Let us encourage honesty and integrity.

Cricket cam to assume he connotation of propriety. Hence the phrase ""it's just not cricket!""

We can be proud of that.

We must protect it.

And with your continued leadership, we will.""",misc

And flashin a .45 colt to yo throat, leave in yo casket
Rockin mo ice aspen, diamonds tha size of asprins
Walk wit a Dirty limp, I talk wit tha Dirty accent
Way my rhymes a touch ya like sexual harrasement
50 percent violation and 50 percent on cashmen
Faster than Nascar, pull like a tow guard
I flow hard, chargin by tha minute like a phone card
Disquinshed gentlemen, sweatin brothas like penaltints
Smokin middle tin, blackin mouths, clockin benjamins
Rockin timbalands, lockin down tha dirty premesises
Cake time is unlimited, from championships ta scrimages
So fly, we defy tha laws of gravity
Anatomy of a king so u can crown me like cavity
Nigga that's Pronoun, Dirty Unit historical
I answer to nobody, keep questions rhetorical
Wit mo action, whippin ass like Joe Jackson
If you see it contain jus, remain tha future attraction
Main event offense, you can't contain tha prevent
Concrete for a line of defense that's hard as cement

I rip tha mic wit tha force of a black hole on a intergaltic plateau
Tha rhymin weapon, spittin faster than bullet shadows
I smack clones, divorcin my thoughts wit cracked bones
And when I rhyme I give more lines than tapped phones
Damage ya beach, burnin tracks wit flamable speech

Battlin me is like goin to hell askin for heat
Cause I'm rougha than leatha and tougha than african feet
Walkin these scandolous streets like an evangelist priest
Keepin it heated like Cool J and Canibus beef
I rip your vocal cords, put a body in every morgue
Wit heavy metaphors hittin harda than every George

Desperation keeps the quest alive
Storm winds soon whip as the calmness dies
Breath filled with the grit of sand
Torrents of fury rape the land

Dreams of your promised land
Burning as the wind descends

Against your will I will command
The blade of vengeance tearing
Your lifeline is in my hand

Makes more sense than looking to the sky

It always preferred the sunshine

Can we pretend we're talking
I'll answer for you if you don't mind

My marriage is failing but I keep trying all the time

All your clothes
I thought I could donate them to a theatre
They'd make up the wardrobe
To a great play a cast of characters, unknowns
Who never took for granted, a sight, a sound, the smell of a rose

I hear you got lots of friends
But I'm worried you can't hear music anymore
And it never occurred to me
Until I heard Dr. John sing that song
And you played through his fingers on the piano
Honkey Tonk a little stride
You could even swing

We wanted to do
Forgetting by the numbers
When I think of you

Proposal at the regular and concepts to share
Truth was false, what’s false was true
And less did you care

The breaking point, white flag raised
My head fell face down
Miserable at every corner
When you were around

Aboard on the ship
Sailing to the oceans core
And waves above the tip
But now that it’s vanished

To be sticking onto what is worth
The consequences of my birth

A target on my back

Open shot for attack but

So do what you should
And one could say, I went too far
But I never could

Result of the action
And the call to its sound

But the reason was found
Regaining consciousness, of the world that was lost
Connecting with the friendships
Everyone that I tossed

You came out, I came in
You left in the morning then I went to the gym
Pushing all these weights cause I’m getting big
And I’m in my own lane, you could call me the stig
Haven’t seen you in years, still running your mouth
Couple opps in the ville, but I’m running them out
Started chatting bare shit on my line
But I’ll still catch you like I’m fishing for trout
I got people looking at me wanting me to fail but I work to hard for that
I got people telling me I sound shit, but I keep going way too hard on a track

How could you win

Was trapped
Then I found peace and trust in rap
I fire shots, don’t fuck with straps
Too many man are worried ‘bout cash
Tell my boys, no stress relax
Then I got home an’ I made that clap
Took a few hits and sips safe rash
And I got fucked
So I loaded that
Found love in her soul just
Like that nectar
Wear grey fruit of the loom
No sweatshirt
Closed doors and I some had trouble with shit
Hidden messages I’m feelin imma have to admit
Can’t find peace at Uni
Like I managed to with you and I
So I put myself on the line
And I hung myself out to dry
I’m not one making the em’s
Just owning my shit till the end
I’ll never back down even when I’m a mess
I’ll be grinding this shit till the literal end
It’s the love that I give and I’m proud for it
If you like it like that, then I’m down for it
I got my OG back writing bars from within
And a new look on life, a remission of sin
It’s my time of the year, it’s my time to begin
And there’s no one to judge me, not even a bit
Might need a free smoke, every once in a while

But I’m choosing my path cause its my time to smile

Singing in sunny tones

With a backpack glance and a cardboard eye
I’m just happy now that I know for sure

Fighting, killing. dying. Landmines underground
Soulless mercenaries firing at will
Psycho military bred to maim and kill

Waiting in the trenches for the counterstrike
When the night is falling catch them by surprise
Running through the minefield, snipers In the trees
Blasting mortar fire, kill the enemy

March towards certain death
No matter what stripes you have
Join us in the killing fields
Emotionless: we do not feel

Throw away your life and be devoured by the war
Set aside your self-respect, obey your generals
Forget about desertion, they want you to die

A precious “today” to me

If all this can become your happiness then

In the dim glow of the moon
Paving its way into the darkness

I see your blood flowing
And the tissue of your muscles gleaming
Through a pearly veil, I moisten my lips

Luminous of a glaze of poison
Devour me with your piercing teeth
Breathe the life back into me

I draw pleasure from it
The pursing of your lips
Hissing silent words
Drowns out the sound of enclosing noise
Curl my toes when you stroke

Our bodies join, like a single being

'Tis the season for all the girls out there to be hot
Mmm, let me tell you a story

[Verse 1]
Had a boyfriend at the start of the year
He was just about as real as a flying reindeer
He really loved to fight, snuck out on story night
But the boy just had to go
Jesus came in, gave me revelations
But I can't say no to a big temptation
I think his name was Sean, he was on vacation
But his fuzzle too low, so he wasn't staying

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh boy, you're hot (Look at that butt)
But is that your car? (What's that?)
Excuse me, is that a hoopty?
Oh baby, who you think you're fooling?
It's a hot girl Christmas
Don't need no Santa Clause to fill my wish list
'Cause I got it all
[Chorus]
And if I need it, I'ma buy it
I'ma get a Lamborghini or some diamonds
Yeah, it's a hot girl Christmas
So go fa-la-la, fa-la-la yourself (Ooh)
So I can fa-la-la myself (Ooh)
It's a hot girl Christmas

[Verse 2]
I got lot's of scandal from my mantle
Girl should eat good, yeah, I love my love handles
I'm a lot to handle, lit like a candle
On the naughty list, 'cause I'm giving out samples
Boy's are just as fake as Santa
Single girls stand up your Adam
Put on your finest, call me your highness
I'm this classic and nasty

We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch

Never in bunches, just me and you

Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it

I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me

Have you ever felt like
Death would be your only escape
You ever felt like
Your life is just another mistake

You ever felt like
Nobody will remember your name
You ever felt like
People will care when it's too late

Well how would it be, if I set myself free from the pain?
How would it be, if I let myself live with the pain?
All by myself, nobody can relate to the pain
“It's alright, you'll be fine”, man that's all they can say

But truly speaking, I'm feeling hopeless
I'm feeling worthless
Got my fears
And I can really never show my tears
But I, But I
Know it's a beautiful pain
So I, So I
I gotta push through the pain

I gotta, fight for what I love
Fight for what I need
I gotta fight for life cause this my only chance
To stay strong, and fight the pain
And give birth to new hope so that my dreams don't die
It's alright

Why do we hide under society’s make up

We hide our fears and never show our tears

It’s alright, it’s a beautiful thing
It’s alright, cause through pain we grow
It’s alright, cause through pain we grow

Have you felt like suicide is the only way out
Only way to release the pain
Only way to let go of all the tension inside your heart
Voices inside your head,telling you that “you ain’t shit!”
Making sure that you hate yourself

Sleepless nights can’t cope with life
Wanna end it now
Cause nobody really cares
And you never let anybody see those tears

Deep down you hurt a lot
And you scared of your own thoughts
You don’t wanna dream no more
When life itself is a nightmare

And you wanna escape, escape, escape
And you crying out for help
(Crying out for help)

And you wanna escape, escape, escape
And you crying out for help

And release these slugs to your dome piece, now be deceased
Fuckin' with me is like walkin' over boilin' lava
Bein' choked by a piece of barbed wire
Nigga retire, I'm on fire
Burnin' emcees as if they were standin' ten feet away from the sun
Nigga ya done
Buckin' and killin' and robbin' niggas I never did it
But if a nigga's too close or disrespects he gotta get it
And they'll be askin' who did it and got away with it

Fake niggas can't see me, cuz they blind to the facts
Wise like an owl, got the power to devour
Destroy cowards, every minute in an hour
It's my mental, plus my pencil, and my paper
That make'em catch the vapors, and wanna do a caper
If you comin', I got the welcome without the thank you
Here's some Scarface mafia shit, that's gone stank you
The Partners and the Menace gone be tight to the finish
We want everything, from potatoes to the spinach
Green?  We want it all
Ninety-seven we gone ball
Whoever don't like it, fuck all y'all

Come take a walk with a villain nigga, ain't nothin' to a cap-peelin
Where I'm from, it's either kill or have your nap spillin'
Adapted killin' as a youngsta
Jack mode niggas and then I tell you
Best to empty your pockets like a dumpster
Who wants some? Fuckin' with the gun or it's on
Here's a six feet tomb for you bustas headed home
Body, dreaded dome, soldier twisted up from the South
Claimin' Boot Camp til' I die, fuck what you bout
Playa challenge your will, challenge your steel, bullets start racin
It's the threat, turnin' niggas into a heart patient
The narcs, chasin' panic and Luciano
Real niggas with power, others turnin' sour, look
Hangin' from the tower, it's P-N-C and the menace
Still bringin' drama, this squad is in it to win it
Pierce your wig, you finished, niggas become the away
Fuckin' with the Crescent City killas, this N.O.L.A., nigga!

Don't tear, I'll re-wrap it later
Mom wouldn't care I'm a gift invader
'Cus nobody's there when I go to wake her
Nobody's aware I'm off on a caper
I'm a little scared, is this what she paid for?
Did Waygetter get a play-tester?
Think they'd make their wares just a little safer
I was not prepared, there was no disclaimer
To account for their jeopardous behaviour
Better take care to avoid the danger
Mama knows you're there and you won't escape her
Could have chosen a bear or a Power Ranger
But I went for presents a little stranger
Are these babies out to save me?
Do they want me dead, do they want a saviour?

Tend to every need or they'll start a-screamin'
Baby not a peep, Mama's been a schemein'
And she's gonna keep coming til I'm bleedin'
What's with all the eggs that you guys are leavin'?
Should I be collecting them for a reason?
Already got a lot of problems I'm dealing
A treasure hunt is NOT what I need this evening!
No sugar plums, I don't think I'm dreaming
Hope that these boxes have receipts in
At least a Furby wouldn’t hurt me
And in the dark they'd just be sleeping!

Alone on the porch and my torch keeps on dying
How come their batteries last longer than mine?

No! I meant asleep!

Deep in the basement, they're waiting you'll find
To catch her on tape, all is placed and aligned
You'll never have a silent night

Someday you'll see that all I want is to please, oh
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will I wait?
How many summers will I wait?
How many shoulders will I break?

Why would I carry such a weight on my shoulders?
Why do I always help you carry your boulders?
You wonder why I carry such a weight on my shoulders
Why would I t-t-t-t-t such a load?
And someday you'll see, all I want is to please, oh
Next time I'll try it another way

How long will I sit and wait like a soldier?
How many summers will I wait?

Ahh, huh, Ty, yeah, hear me, yeah
They say all you gotta do is make a hit
So I don't feel no pressure I just
Yeah, yeah
Hear me, GO

[Hook]
And they say all you gotta do is make a hit
So I don't feel no pressure I just make a hit
Cut off a lot of people I was hanging with
I got to let them know the flow is dangerous
Up all night, I've been up all night
Tryna make a hit let them notice I'm legit I been up all night
Up all night, I've been up all night
[Runnin'] through the beats I been losing all my sleep I been up all night
Insomniac, Let the beat run, let it run

[Verse 1]
Numero, uno, true flow
Too cold, pluto, alright
I already go frostbite in two toes, Move over
I came to claim the game and bring the pain
And they can’t contain me man, I’m David Blaine
They say remain the same, no changing lanes
Don’t make me laugh like Shane and Damon Wayans
You got cool jokes
I told em I’m bout to blow
They say, “dog you gone mad, Cujo,”
Victory lap is too close
But I’m still really feeling down on my glucose
And I’m hungry like I’m playing at a juco
And I’m trying to get picked up by a new coach
Thought I was a pushover, I’m sumo
Bout to go nine tailed Fox, Naruto
Ripping this beat is impossible
Till I give it every little piece of my molecules
This isn’t even allowable, Shoutout to Austin, Makenzo
My team is phenomenal
Sitting and dreaming, what I’ma do
Leave it to me like I’m Beaver, believe me I got it dude
If we are competing I’m a flame-breathing dragon, I’m medieval
Pull up on the scene feeling like Evil Knievel
Brainstorming so much I been feenin’ for FEMA
Buzz looking smaller than Tila Tequila
But I’m moving faster than three lamborghini’s
Video been traveling, people they see me
And they know I’m snapping like they got me heated
Broker than Aladdin, I need me a genie
They been sleeping on me, so I ain’t been sleeping
[Hook]
And they say all you gotta do is make a hit
So I don't feel no pressure I just make a hit
Cut off a lot of people I was hanging with
I got to let them know the flow is dangerous
Up all night, I've been up all night
Tryna make a hit let them notice I'm legit I been up all night
Up all night, I've been up all night
[Runnin'] through the beats I been losing all my sleep ah

[Verse 2]
I wanna squeeze the game for all it’s worth
Get it by the torso, this is Mortal Kombat
This is Gorro, Making rappers tap like trying Morse code
Have em’ catching Z’s like fighting Zorro
Crafting masterpieces, I’m abnormal
Travel back with me, let’s ride the warp hole
Take me back to like 2004 yoooo
When I started freestyling outside I was in seventh grade
Marc, Javan, and James standing up on the pavement
I was making the flames, they were just all amazed cause
I was a nerd rapper, I came with imagination
Then it started happening basically on the daily
Everybody gathering, bothering all the neighbors
I was a teenager, Rhymes were kind of basic
I had to level up in the hyperbolic chamber
And I became a superman, supersaiyan, super slaying
All of my verses, superhuman, never had beats by Metro Boomin
But I had beats on the metro boomin, In my headphones
Lines in my head go stupid, Words in my brain they connect with music
So many links you would think the fellow’s Cuban
Waiting for my stop, I was mellow cruising
Back in those days I was battling Retro
And all my classmates they were rocking Ecko
The only thing I could afford was South Pole
But I was cool cause they knew I wreck flows
Now I’m trying to steal the spotlight, I’m a klepto
To be a leader of the south, got diarrhea of the mouth
Need pepto, They say there’s no space in the game, Let go
Well watch as I open up a lane, presto
[Outro]
And they will never go hard as that
Lost my heart and I got it back
Now I'm back where i started at
I'm sleepless
Sleepless and insomniac
Nights alone I give all I have
Tell them all I ain't falling back
Yeah, they will never go hard as that
Lost my heart and I got it back
Now I'm back where i started at
I'm sleepless
Sleepless and insomniac
Nights alone I give all I have",rap

While i'm able bodied I’ll move mountains
And fly on my own, without any engines roaring
But my backbone can only hold so much
I think its withering away

But Im still young and I know its temporary
I just might make it in one piece


While i'm here I want you to know
I'm trying my hardest to defeat
The me in my head, that wants so desperately
To stay inside, and off of my feet

I just woke up
From a crazy dream

But the green gets greener onthe other side
Still I ride
What's a cowboy to do?
Bronco Billy rides a buck on the go-round
Got thrown in the corporate hoedown
Swimming like a fish up the stream
And he's holding on to a piece of the dream
Where the bright lights sure ain't all that they seem
Feels like he's headin' for the fall

It's said that money talks
And I'll not deny
I heard it once, it said goodbye
Oh Lord, I've got to put my trust in You
Came a whisper that we're playin' the fools
You can't win when they're changing the rules
And I'm ready to wish on a star
Yes I know Lord you've brought me this far
And I've learned that it's only You
Who can change my attitude
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
What we do
What we say

Eternal youth all summer long

Thought I was being natural
Turned out I was acting it
Counting minutes ‘til they figure me out
Fidget with my skin like an abacus
Every sound stares
Wishing I would look back at ‘em
But I’m enchanted by the walls
Every room turns into the Vatican

[Verse]
Shoulder blades scraping against the edge of the world, I watched you coming in
Your regular girl face grazed my chrome-plated grin, don’t rub it in
Snake slithering in colorless dust, straight kicking, hadn’t fluttered for months
You can’t stomach every one of your devilish curls, but to me they’re coveted
Covеring the glades in the napе of your neck
Were they made to pave the way or made to protect?
I wanna break the empty space, wade in the depths
Rain spraying my faded temples
But I wasn’t made to get wet, at least not yet
I wanna save my breath and sweat for fucking your basic perfection
For days on end, shit I swayed against the grain in question
A grotesque painting has no place in this setting
Your frame is sun-kissed, edition one, the latest invention, let me
Let me recalibrate your insides, tinker with your meticulous parts
Your fragrance is so benign it makes me salivate
Drip drip, wish it was harsh
I fucking hate the way your positions are balanced
Quick, shift
Let me sing this ballad in you, twist you in the most ridiculous arcs
‘Til you’re as sinister as my non-traditional arts
I’m only symmetrical in the dark
Fuck me hard, bitch

Beam of belief in identity
It's not deceiving to be this way

The picture, I like it, so don't be rude

If you knew what to do, then you'd do what you said
Proxy the awesome and seek the deletion

Opt for the option to stop this exhaustion
And breathe through the tube of civility
The end is, the end is, the end is the end of days
And we can get it in the open
Tell me all your secrets, show me how to make you mine
Because you got me feeling nervous
Know I don't deserve it, but you're giving me the signs
I bet you never saw me coming
Well I've had my eye on you for miles
Just had to get it in the open
Take off all your clothes and, baby, let me blow your mind
Baby, let me blow your mind

A sacred emblem 1 is the kahili of Kuakamano
That sends out its stiff branches as a sacred frill,
Which fills the faint-hearted with awe,
But brings such ones to claim friendship. p. 21
Those are beings who eat by gushing waters,
Who eat also by the dashing sea,
They live in nests inside ditches,
There in hollow places the parent rats dwell,
There huddle together the little mice.
It is they who keep the changes of the month.

The mites of the land,
The mites of the water,
’Tis Mehe the reddish seaweed
Whose lashes stand,
That hides and peeps.
There are rats inland, there are rats at sea.
There are also rabbits
That were born in the night of the crash--
They were born in the night that moved away.
The tiniest mice move by crawling;
The tiny mice spring as they move.
They run over the pebbles,
The propagating pebbles where no inland ohia bear.
A puny child born in the night of the crash.
They gave birth to beings that leaped in the night, that moved away
The child of Uli-a-kama last night.
’Tis night.",misc

[Hook x4]
I ain't lying, dead cops in my basement

[Verse 1]
Check my chat logs online
Keep a buck-knife on the waistline
Brin be used to the wasteland life
So me and Dale take your life
Yes, we pack gun, tag a thick tongue
Bonafide fried ass cheek meat on the taste buds
Jack risked it all on Titanic you dumbass bitches
If your ship was sinking too aren't you thinking that you would panic?
Cock the fucking gun and blast the knees off of a mannequin
At Dillards, I'm number 13 like Millard Fillmore
Swerving in a Jeep, the Beep Boys got the shmeat
And I'm really gonna smackle my salami on your teeth
Brian doеsn't mean to ever do this shit on purposе
I'm just stealing purses
Burping Zachy shirtless at the fucking circus
Every now and then I'm going psycho
Leave my ass alone and do not touch it unless you try to
Take your bicycle and your push start car parked in your backyard
Watch Joey wreck the bike in your front yard
Got poison ivy nuggets growing in a bucket
At my cousins, every now and then I pluck em and say fuck it
Fuck it, smoking leaves of three will get you puffin
Pretty soon your feeling nothing
So I point the fucking gun and smoke your nugget with it
[Hook x4]
I ain't lying, dead cops in my basement

[Verse 2]
Blue jeans, popping two beans
Driving in a two seat police chief wagon from the 50's
New meat for your new bitch
Living like she never got a hot tard cock on her cool teeth
I switch the flow up, stab a mother fucker and let out a Boa-
Constrictor in your family home
Shouldn't have been a homo around a cobra
Dale's been funny since college
It doesn't take a lot but I like a lot bitch
I really go dumb when I shoot the wrong bitch
It'll take time for me to stop this
Suckle on my balls and get off my cock bitch
Locking the basement, they calling a locksmith
Tear your ass up like some Betty Crock mix
Serve your ass up with some Chinese chop sticks, uh
Uh, she wanted a murderer
Uh, she got what she wanted
Uh, she wanted a murderer
So I point the gun at your head
Rambo strapped back with the lead
And enough ammo stacked back in the shed
Off with their heads, off, off with their heads
Roll around in the grass till my fucking backs red
Chill out one minute, slapping your face your hat be spinning
Slipping the slag in the fucking kitchen
Wonder what Brian's making for dinner?
At Dale's house, man there's no silverware
Eating with my fingers
I be slopping and gagging, I need some silverware
(whoo, yeah, dude)

9549,"There's a room in a house in a street in a manor in a borough
That's part of a city that is generally referred to as London
It's a dark place, a mysterious place
And it is said that if you're born within the sound of Bow-Bells
You have the necessary qualifications to be christened a Londoner
(It's a cruel place, it's a hard place)
But when you think back to all the great Londoners
William Blake, Charles Dickens, Dick Whittington
Pearly kings, barrow boys, Arthur Daley, Max Wall
And don't forget the Kray twins

But if you're ever up on Highgate Hill on a clear day
You can see right down to Leicester Square (London, London)
Crystal Palace, Clapham Common, right down to Streatham Hill
North and South, I feel that I'm a Londoner still (London, London)

Chiswick Bridge to Newham and East Ham
Churchbells ring out through the land
You were born in London, England
(London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London)
And there's a tap by a reservoir, leading to a stream
That turns into a river estuary that eventually opens to the sea
(London, London)
And there's a docker by a wharf, sending cargo overseas
Unloading foreign trade from a large ocean vessel
In the mighty metropolitan port of London
(London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London)

When I think of all the Londoners still unsung
East-enders, West-enders, Oriental-enders
Fu Manchu, Sherlock Holmes, Jack Spock, Henry Cooper
Thomas A'Becket, Thomas Moore, and don't forget the Kray twins

There's a part of me that says ""Get out""
Then one day I'll hear somebody shout
""Sounds to me like you come from London Town""

But if you're ever up on Highgate Hill on a clear day
I'll be there (I'll be there)
Yes I will be there (there)
Through the dark alley-ways and passages of London, London
London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London, London
London, London, through the dark alley-ways and passages of London, London",pop
2740,"I'm a shock-rock Romeo
I like to leave 'em shattered
Oh, I can love 'em and leave 'em
It doesn't really matter

I never met my match
Until I met that lady
She hooked me
She cooked me
She practically filleted me

Some girls try and get you in bed
Some girls are like a kick in the head
Some girls make you wish you were dead
Some girls make you blue when you should be seeing red

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
A woman of mass distraction
The first time I saw her
She said she wants to date me
The next time I come back she tried to castrate me

Some girls try and get you in bed
Some girls are like a kick in the head
Some girls make you wish you were dead
Some girls make you blue when you should be seeing red

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
A woman of mass distraction

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
Some kind of woman
She's a woman

I feel like a motherless child
A long way from home, a long way from home

(Chorus x2)
I feel like I'm wasted, better don't replace me
Feeling like I'll got it cause all my life I have been chasing
They might think I'm crazy, better don't offend me
One day I will be popping for the ones that wanted to save me

Look at me, you better look at me

Baddest bitch, yeah baddest bitch
Rolling right beside me, then she on her knees
(Yeah)
By this time you sleeping, Im on my creeping
Using all my chances, I've been busy with my clique, bitch
Take your time, your better take your time
You need couple lessons for you to change your mind
I've been on my grind, feeling dizzy, I'll break your spine
Every lyrics that I'm spitting, it's a story of my life
Yeah I paid the price, I've been seeing high
Equipment collected, my soul is protected from  ones who wishing me bad

Wasted, I feel wasted

Watch me and relax bitch, you can't even handle smoke
Hotbox it's my home bitch, I've been working since I'm born, I can't even stop this cause I think it's in my blood

You love music
That's true love
I know that no one else love music like you do",rap
