Feel, Those things you do
In your eye's there’s no escape plan
Do the things you want to me

In her eyes
She gets chance to take the bite of hate
There's a bit of fire wanting to run free
One day you'll see
Don’t come down to me
Let's Dance!

Snake! I am the snake in your dreams
Tempting! At the move you make
Let me make you mine
Be not afraid of me
I will free you

9110,"Welcome to the mind of undiscovered raps
Before you enter leave your criticism at the doormat
And get a whiff of the greenery peep the gallery
Of a lyricist with diligence and hospitality
The paper scrapping with the pen to make a salary
And hoping not to get a bad reaction like an allergy
So I have to study rap and its anatomy
In order to survive and kill tracks without a casualty
The fans attention is the rat I want to capture
Using tactics of a cat to burn the track up with the rapture
Knowing what I'm after
I'm training with the swagger and the lyrics til its mastered
(Welcome)to the thoughts of a black skater
Overcoming obstacles kick-flipping over haters
Rolling with the beat like it's acceleration
My potential continues to rise my nigga I just call it elevation

Welcome"

When I was younger
My daddy told me I would never
Never amount to nothing special
He'd come at me from every angle
He'd say
""You're the last thing I wanted, the last thing I need
How am I gonna answer when my friends tell me
My son was kissing boys in the street?""

[Verse 2]
He tried to change me
Said I'm embarrassing my country
How could I do this to my family?
Do I wanna grow up being lonely?
He'd say
""We've worked for our money, we put you in school
Is this how you repay us? Do you think this is cool?
My son, stop kissing boys in the street
My son, stop kissing boys in the street""
[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm older
My daddy's heart's a little warmer
But he still won't hug me like my brother
And he still won't kiss me like my mother
He'd say
""You're a part of this family, I made you myself
But the way that you act isn't good for your health
My son, stop kissing boys in the street
My son, stop kissing boys in the street""

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
My daddy's dying
And he's finally realized I'm not lying
We sit in silence but we're smiling
Because for once we are not fighting
He says
""There was no way of knowing 'cause all I was taught
Is men only love women, but now I'm not sure
My son, keep kissing boys in the street
My son, keep kissing boys in the street
When I'm gone, keep kissing boys in the street"""

You'll find, baby, and I dart behind some cloth
A rattlesnake hisses behind me
I jump up blindly and run along down the road

I'm just sayin' I can't stand still
When the drums are marching by
And the sun's so bright

You know I can't stand still
When she twirls so wild
Look in her sparkling eye

They came undercover to spy me
But I took my mirror and reflected back their scope
I invented a new way to fly me
To a New England town with charm beyond my hopes

I'm just sayin' I can't stand still
With the find to swing me high
Release and wind, release and wind
No, I can't stand still
When she's closing in behind
And I hold the sky

Yeah, stones
Get thrown when darkness comes in
When I go home
It's faster than your throw

I'm just sayin' I can't stand still
When the wind dried my eye
In pantomime stripe

You know I can't stand still
Like a grounded yellow kite
When the sun's so bright
The sun's so bright

The sun's so bright

Standing 12 feet high

Hoping not to die

I was not high
I was not high
I was not high
No, not this time


I took my own road
I took it far and wide
I came across a stone
And I tried to ride
""Is there not just death?""
I asked, as if once in my life
I tried not to get scared
But I held my wife

I was not high

This one’s for my little sister, older brother, all my cousins
The Thomas man I hope that you caught up in all this fuss kid
To all the lovers
Hearts on fire but they still tryna hide, guess we all undercovers
I ain’t had a moment to myself in a minute
Been plottin' all my shit and makin' super rash decisions
Designing all my music to a scientist's specific
Feelin like I’m insane, at least I can admit it
Every night the same dream feelin' like a vision
It must be this stained brain pumping my intentions
When I first hit the main stage, I put up defenses
Now I step up onto the scene Dr. King disposition
And now the fiends wanna listen
To every line I write, by the sink in my kitchen
Damn, does the whole world think like a nigga?
Damn, does the whole world? Go figure
Now I been in church for almost every single main religion
And understand that people, they need something to believe in
But if you preach hatin, preach violence and still got the nerve to say the world is the problem, it’s funny
Nah, see the world is a beautiful place
If you got the faith to see past the religion or race
It ain’t the color of the face it’s the expression
But as far as hate goes, some people wear the same clothes since adolescence
Now they scared and defensive, wars have started for less
Fighting over the fact that we all so fearful of death
Separate so our kind is the only people that’s left
This ""pick your poison"" is poor or fortunate, no one’s exempt
See I believe in love, I believe in peace
Believe in the ‘burbs and believe in the streets
See I believe that we are one
It's all the same God here, that means we all sons
We all daughters and we all one, we are one
All brothers and sisters under this one sun
And so, I ain’t sayin' lose faith in what’s above
I’m just sayin' that for me, my religion is love
[Hook]
Different colors and different lives
Different darkness and different lights
Maybe someday we will grow
Close enough to see the gold in
Different colors and different lives
Different darkness and different lights
Maybe someday we will grow
Close enough to see the gold in

Love is my religion, my religion, my religion
Love is my religion, my religion, my religion"

9227,"I sat.  It all was past;
Hope never would hail again;
Fair days had ceased at a blast,
The world was a darkened den.

The beauty and dream were gone,
And the halo in which I had hied
So gaily gallantly on
Had suffered blot and died!

I went forth, heedless whither,
In a cloud too black for name:
- People frisked hither and thither;
The world was just the same."

Cause i don’t belong here

I do things i can
I’m mostly lonely
Except the crabs on the sand

Making what i can
I clean off the tables
With my damaged hands

I stack the shelves
Box on top of box
The repetition kills me
I’m a boring man

When the night turns upside down

I need the shrooms, I eat a lil, yeah I'm trippin out
Poisoning my mind, surely I'll forget about
The day, u fucked my mind up, made me hate myself
Been poisoning my body, cause I go thru hell
Everyday I barely eat cause so depressed
Life's a test but I know, yea I fail dat f’sho
Went from acting like I care , but I don’t (yup)
Might as well drug a lot, and get extra drunk (uhu)
Wonder why I'm lonely, look I so damn boney (yea)
Starved myself to sleep, I can’t get hungry (damn)
To much stress, need to smoke some weed
Can't live through this depression girl my mind is weak
Hate this feeling, need to end this shit real quick
Need to end this shit real quick"

Nasty young nigga, I might hit it with her friend
You ain't talkin' 'bout money, nigga, I don't understand

Fifty thousand stuffed in the bag, won't fit in my pants
I got all my niggas 'cause we all come from the same

I wouldn't love you the way I do

I think I'm turning out alright, thanks to you
And momma I'm ready for the real world
Just watch what I can do

I'm a woman that you can be proud of
Like your momma was when she raised you
I'm gonna need you in my darkest hours, and on my best days too
I'm sure gonna make mistakes but let me learn my lessons
I'm gonna cry and when I do
As I keep getting older I'll still need your shoulder

Senior high school year, graduation day
We cried us a river cause your baby's going away
Far from this town, away from all I know
But it's okay, I'll learn to live my life from the love you gave me at home
And if I'm doing great, or down to my last prayer
I know it doesn't matter, I know you'll still be there

I'm a woman that you can be proud of
Like your momma was when she raised you
I'm gonna need you in my darkest hours, and on my best days too

But she knows she wouldn't make it that far

Julie's on her way to a place she knows
Static coming through on the radio

Sarah sits and waits, humming, see the sky about to rain
But she knows no whistle blows through the cold anymore

Tells her to relax as he lights an incense
Little does he know the woman's defenseless
Overwhelemed by his presence and his gift...of gab
Something she never had cause she never had the best relationship with her dad
It throws her off guard
He finds her to be so far from these other brauds
Pulls out scented oils as he offers a massage
Instantly her mind undergoes a barrage
She already knows that he knows she's in charge
There goes the pause…
One foot slips out of her heels
A clear indication shits about to get real/ sex appeal
But nobody identifies it's /in both of their eyes
Elements of mystery combined with the surprise
From the inner thighs
Never a lack of trust
Until the prophylactic bust

Gives him a deep look into his eyes
Smiled then asked him what was really on his mind

Only testing to see if his honesty will expose his inner glow
The feelings mutual
Speaking too soon may interrupt the flow
You know...it's something beautiful
But better when it's never explained and only shown
Her final request a demonstration…

Or should I say sex-tion

Critical clitoral testing…
Abreast affection…
A succulent suggestion…

When the wind is strummin' a sagebrush guitar
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin'
It always finds me wishin' on a star

Another bank closes its doors

A man downtown tried to fly away

From it all on the eighteenth floor

And everything he worshipped

Ain't worth nothing now

A house with eighteen rooms

Every night he dined alone

Fed from a silver spoon

Guess he never figured out

You can't fill your heart with silver and gold

You've got to have some love

To satisfy your soul

We've got to pool together

To make it on our own

That sits out on

A backwoods gravel road

The own lets

The poor folks slide
If they can't pay what they owe

He says its only money

Ain't no good when you're gone

Now he'll never be a rich man

But he's smiling every day

He's gets everything he needs

By giving it away

I'll try to see only the surface of the water but
The jokes continues and the purple hate gives a clear signal

Vector rises
And it brings lucid reasons to follow a balanced trail
The return journey doesn't frighten me
It doesn't frighten anymore

The serpent will not eat it's tail again

Easy don't work with integrity, that's why the righteous road is barren and hard
I left some of my friends dead on the shoulder, but they went out fighting and with a broken heart
Doin' things the right way

The only way to look back on your life is to make sure you have no regrets
Never take the easy way out, never compromise, mind your heart, forget your head
Never sell out your brothers and sisters, never sell yourself out or short
And if anyone attacks part of the family, go to the mattresses, cause its time for the war
Many will think that they're part of the family - but they're not, you gotta stay on guard
But always let in your brothers and sisters in with the common blood and share an uncommon heart
Doin' things the right way

The harder it gets - the more that its worth it
The more ferocious the fight - your blood boils purer
The more you kicked your resolve gets tougher
Remember to behold the night - be a fighter and a lover
There aren't many of us left - we got to take our chances
Hearts on the wire - sweet souls dancing
When all bets are off and judgment day comes
You're still standing - you f**kin won
Doin' things the right way"

Now it’s time to see if this rap shit is going to work out like I got no time to work out. That’s a lame excuse if you wanna be lookin like all them other ppl you gotta make the time and if you do you better but all your effort into it or it’s going to end up like shit all over again

Lil' bitch, I brought it out and told twelve to ""Keep the rest""
Yeah, I ain't had no license, but I had the pack on deck
So I'm glad that they just took me, and they didn't even check
Make the pack do a backflip, Evel Knievel

We see him in last place, that's where we gon' leave him
Just go and get a bag, bae, I promise I won't leave you
Yeah, bosses take a loss, so I'm doin' okay
I could make a couple thousand dollars in a couple days
Know a hit dog gon' holler, and these niggas really snakes
Huh, come through pop my collar, see these niggas, they gon' hate
Why you mad that I'm eating? You might be put on a plate
When I'm riding 'round the city, serving, bitch, I'm duckin' jakes
Yeah, lil' bitch, I'm movin' smart, and you know I'm stayin' safe
I might have to stash this gas, I don't wanna catch a case
Yeah, yeah, okay (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We see him in last place, wouldn't wanna be him
Run it up and make a bag, bae, that's gon' make 'em evil
Yeah, you in last place, I can't even see you
Bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout a bag, give a fuck about these people
Bitch, I'm thinkin' 'bout a bag, give a fuck about these people
I'ma put you in a bag, if you try to test my people
Yeah, I'm thinkin' 'bout a bag, give a fuck about these people

Tell me, was your summer good
Did you ever make it in Hollywood
I’ve been thinking ‘bout judgment day
I can smell the smoke from a thousand miles away

[Verse 2]
Swarming around us like honey flies
Taste something else and give us some time
Looking for new sounds on the radio dial
Something to love for just a little while
Just a while ‘til I’m feeling fine
Just a while until

[Verse 3]
Laying in the bedroom, the curtains in style
Open windows and ghostly smiles
California and other trials
I’ve seen the view there, it’s not that nice
Treading water on holy time
Every object gets lost in the tide
Concrete forests with eyes to the sky
Holding onto a every bit of light
Brain’s on fire, that’s okay
Brain’s on fire

It's funny how you fall asleep with headphones, that when you do, the music, your mind turns it off. Not until you come back to reality, and then you start hearing it again.

5387,"""Make You Mine"" was produced by Danja and I had the great opportunity of working with Claude Kelly, who has written songs for Michael Jackson to, you can name it, it's insane. The list of artists that he has worked with, it's mind blowing. And so the opportunity to work with him was amazing and we recorded the song in New York and I remember being there and recording that with him and it was just a really great outcome. I, I remember we kind of thought in our minds, ""Let's kind of do a Michael Jackson tribute"" and ""Make You Mine"" is what it came about from it."

Offbeat dark poetry
My heartbeat drums with the
Fall leaves and soon I will with the
Seasons breeze come and go
Fall asleep with your drawing on my wall
I repeat this: Unattainable
'Til my teeth grit down to the bone

Sweet Coffee
She floating now
She's the girl at the party dressed up as a cloud
I'm the prick with the cigarette
Hanging half lit out my mouth
Dumbfound
I would try to bring you down
But your curls look better
With the full moon dripping down your sweater
And your cotton candy body
Got my roller-coaster rocking
Off of nothing
Often smoking something
Sippin' sweet coffee
Like, where are we now?
Wonderland Alice tumbling to the ground
Scrambling over the trembling sound
Over the town
Lovely now
Look at the princess without a crown
Singing
Sweet Coffee
Espresso shot me
Got me lofty
Caused me to spin off-key
Stop me
I can't speak
My knees are weak
You bleed caffeine
I breathe in deep morphine
So sweet coffee"

""Dynamic Duo"" (x2)

[Verse 1: JC Assassin]
The duo dynamic, sinking the Titanic’s
It’s automatic if you play around, it gon' be climatic
Choppers coming to your porch, turn your neighborhood to Columbine
Me and G15, twin choppers, double homicide
Double jeopardy, and now your family lives jeopardized
Niggas bugging out so I’m grabbing pesticide
Wait for me to come out on this expedition
Split decisions, split personality’s opinion
Y'all had to screw up bout as bad as my doctor did
Bomb to the neighborhood watch, it kill your foster kids
Currently giving certainty of emergency
The absurdity of your words will murder you internally
For eternity, my extensions extensive
Excessive, forensics ain’t nothing effective
The new Rae and Ghostface, making you a cold case
G15 will put your head on the showcase
[Hook: 개코]
이 험한 현실에서 아직 붙잡아두고 싶은 꿈
높고 힘든 삶의 능선에서 때론 포기하고 싶은 꿈
너와 천천히 오래 걷고 싶어, until the end of time
지금 난 간절히 원해 한 조각의 peace of mind
에야호 에야호 에야호 에야호 (x2)

[Verse 2: gamemast15r]
G15 rolls like the lifestyles of rich and famous
The clips with stainless; don't try to intimidate, you just an ignoramus
The kitchen made us, like this is the shit that happens
When the crime lords come together and clean crack off of the stitch and fabric
This shit is magic, and we all prosper til' the end of time
No reason to fear cause we sent all the En's to die
Stacks and stacks of money making material
Rubbing off the fingerprints and scratching off all the serials
Now we living in mansions, yachts and condos down in the Islands
Silence is the key to moving bricks, or else you have to move to violence
And that's no man's land, it's a place of random interludes
Chances are high of bullets flying into you
That's the type of bullshit that only the sinful do
You'll end up in prison, serving all of your kin some food
And it's all possible, with guard dogs that look like Cujo
Pay back all the people you owe, we the Dynamic Duo

We’ll put you a cold six thousand meters into the ground
Shots to your family, hang the noose around
Make your death look like an accident, what’s happenin'?
The way your body looks will make you look like you used an ounce
Might pull up on your block and fire rounds unannounced
Your world is blackening, even though police examining
You won't ever find nothing, police is never catchin' shit
Ninja blades formed like they were asterisks
Disappear like magic bitch, Ghostface moving fishscale
Got the Bruce Wayne gadgets, choppers all Chris Bale
Got a throne room made of stacks of dollars, you wonder how we live well
Cocaine in the oxygen, high when I go to inhale
Never get high on your own supply, but if it makes you flow
Then throw your hands in the air, in order to make it snow
I make it rain, I’m a young dictator
A true filmmaker, we kill it with no disclaimer"

In ruins on the river bed
Wastelands that lived before the snow
Time stands still

On our way to the sun

546,"WAR

WHEN there was a rumour of war with France a while ago, I met a poor Sligo woman, a soldier's widow, that I know, and I read her a sentence out of a letter I had just had from London: 'The people here are mad for war, but France seems inclined to take things peacefully,' or some like sentence. Her mind ran a good deal on war, which she imagined partly from what she had heard from soldiers, and partly from tradition of the rebellion of ’98, but the word London doubled her interest, for she knew there were a great many people in London, and she herself had once lived in 'a congested district.' 'There are too many over one another in London. They are getting tired of the world. It is killed they want to be. It will be no matter; but sure the French want nothing but peace and quietness. The people here don't mind the war coming. They could not be worse than they are. They may as well die soldierly before God. Sure they will get quarters in heaven.' Then she began to say that it would be a hard thing to see children tossed about on bayonets, and I knew her mind was running on traditions of the great rebellion. She said presently, 'I never knew a man that was in a battle that liked to speak of it after. They'd sooner be throwing hay down from a hayrick.' She told me how she and her neighbours used to be sitting over the fire when she was a girl, talking of the war that was coming, and now she was afraid it was coming again, for she had dreamed that all the bay was 'stranded and covered with seaweed.' I asked her if it was in the Fenian times that she had been so much afraid of war coming. But she cried out, 'Never had I such fun and pleasure as in the Fenian times. I was in a house where some of the officers used to be staying, and in the daytime I would be walking after the soldiers' band, and at night I'd be going down to the end of the garden watching a soldier, with his red coat on him, drilling the Fenians in the field behind the house. One night the boys tied the liver of an old horse, that had been dead three weeks, to the knocker, and I found it when I opened the door in the morning.' And presently our talk of war shifted, as it had a way of doing, to the battle of the Black Pig, which seems to her a battle between Ireland and England, but to me an Armageddon which shall quench all things in the Ancestral Darkness again, and from this to sayings about war and vengeance. 'Do you know,' she said, 'what the curse of the Four Fathers is? They put the man-child on the spear, and somebody said to them, ""You will be cursed in the fourth generation after you,"" and that is why disease or anything always comes in the fourth generation.'"

7538,"I know they say we're too young to be in love
Baby, you know that it's just different with us
'Cuz when I looked into your patch
And in your eye
I feel connections in our hearts
And I try
To tell my mom and dad you own a boat
And when you call me ""Wench""
It's just an inside joke

I remember the first day I saw your ship
You had just returned from a treasure hunting trip
And I've been in love since the day I saw you
And I had no doubts when I signed on with your crew

Our love is like a ship sailing through a storm
And I don't mind those other girls
They keep me warm

[Chorus:]
I'm in love with a pirate, baby
I'm sure there's nothing like it, baby
His hair is long, his teeth are old
But I'm drunk most of the time so I don't notice
I'm in love with a pirate, baby
I'm sure there's nothing like it, baby
Every night I get to shine his shoes
And every day is like a Caribbean cruise
Swab the deck
Scrub out the captain's chamber pot
Some days it's bloody cold
Some days it's bloody hot
But it's so worth it to crawl in bed next to you
That's to say if your fleabag monkey's not there too

I love it when you get let me steer the wheel
Even though I know it's because you wanna
Cop a feel

[Chorus]

I have no doubt one day
Me and my love will be wed
So here's to hoping that I can make that
Before I'm dead
Cuz one thing they didn't tell me about the seas
Is how susceptible you are to most to disease
Scurvy, Typhoid, even the Black Plague
Coincidentally, that's how my love got his peg leg

[Chorus]

I'm in love with a pirate, baby
I'm sure there's nothing like it, baby
My hair is gone, my teeth have rot
But he still says I'm smoking hot
I'm in love with a pirate, baby
I'm sure there's nothing like it, baby
Every night I get to shine his shoes
So hoist the colors and dig out all the booze
Cuz life is just a Caribbean cruise"

That's what the people say
Half the buildings are abandoned
And everything is grey
Half the kids have asthma
'Cause of the sewage plants nearby
And the mayor doesn't seem to care
If we live or die

That's the situation
Now let me take you to the part
The center of this neighborhood
What you could call the heart
A vacant lot of broken glass
For years that's what it's been
But the neighbors got together
Said this is where we will begin

(Chorus)
We'll dig this dirt
Plant a seed
Push aside the concrete
So the earth beneath is freed
We will plant a garden
Grow some food to eat
And the sunflowers looking to the sky
Say we reclaim this street
In one day we had accomplished
What the mayor always said
He was trying to bring us
Through his clubs upon our heads
The neighborhood is clean
The dealers gone away
We had good food to eat
A place for the kids to play

(Chorus)
Twice the city came here
Said this is not our land
Twice the cops destroyed it
All the work of our own hands
Uprooted plants and broken tools
Lay scattered all around
But the next day the only thing you could see
Was fingers in the ground

And quite a bunch they are in the morning sun
With blinking eyes the worthless stands
In readiness for transport to the battleground
There's dirty work ahead of them and quite a bunch they are
What do you do with a life of work?
What do you do with a life of work?
What do you do with a life of work?
Face it in the morning, face it in the morning
And the parting of the ways and the interrupted mirth
And the shock that has to come because of what you want
Compared to what you've got
Meet it squarely and it only hurts when it hurts
Life of work, early in the morning"
910,"Traditional, adapted
By Arlo Guthrie

I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue

Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo

I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo

Who should awaken but the woman of the house
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten when I said boo!
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo

Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the fields with the pack on my back
Over the field with my great heavy sack
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu

Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo
It's ""Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu"

Marble pillars holding the door
Empty bottles lining the wall from the night before
Got a Roller out in the garage
But the wheels are stuck to the floor
Got no reason to go anywhere--no friends call anymore
I don't want to be me, I don't want to be me

I know it's hard to see, But I don't want to be me
Had me playing down at the palace
I was declared the belle of the ball
Made the boys take my goods and chattels away--
Now I'm staring at an empty hall
I don't want to be me

Pardon me--I'm on my way
Pardon me but I'm going
Taking on the simple life and I feel the grass roots growing
I'm going to ride the ragged road--
Diamond spurs jangling into the sunset
No circuits running overload--Well maybe I'm not done yet
Now there's nothing left in the cupboard
And three bears' been eating my soup
My life is one big critical mess if you take a look
And the butler's off in Ibiza on expense account gone berserk
But I can't check out of this crazy world
Without being a jerk--I don't want to be me"

Blind to a God who lets you suffer
Redemption, begging for forgiveness
Living a life of constant never ending pain

Blinded by your beliefs
Waiting to someone to save you
Brain washed by religion
Using a book to help you pray

Fear the injection
Of artifical fluids
Your faith will be your downfall
I guess you 'd rather die

Condemned by primitive ways
Born to suffer
To the power of a cross
Swallowed, your fate

Hypnotized, trapped inside
Convinced you'll live if you pray
Reatily, can't you see
Killed by your mindless way
You say the lord will save you
Religious half breed freak
A curable sickness will end you

Oh, Where did you go?

Come now, lets go get high
We can drive all night
And sing our lungs out, like we used to
Kiss me in summer heat
Fight sleep in the back seat
Leave our bodies warn out
Tell me, is our love dead?
Or was it all in my head?
Being the one I need, the one for me
Caught barely breathing
This is the haunting season
Please release me now

Why'd you go away?
Yes, I know what you said
I never called you out
You never call me now

Where did you go? Where did you go?
Where did you go, alone?
Where did you go? Where did you go?
Oh, Where did you go?

Come now, lets go get high
We can drive all night
And sing our lungs out, like we used to
Kiss me in summer heat
Fight sleep in the back seat
Leave our bodies warn out

[Sub Melody]
Hey apple of my eye, you really drive me wild
Kiss me in summer heat to the loose change ep
Wasn't perfect either, probably too eager
Bring your body near lets sweat out the fever
Tell me, is our love dead?
Or was it all in my head?
You being the one I need
The one for me"
5012,"[Verse 1]
It would've been something, something bigger than me
It was nothing, without you and me
After that I wish I could speak

[Verse 2}
I wanna watch your beautiful hair
I’d like to watch you going downstairs
I wanted to tell everybody how beautiful you are
I didn't know this love could go that far

[Pre-Chorus]
In your flip flop, in your wide t-shirt, in your marvelous way to act that I fell in love with

[Chorus}
I will never see you again, 'cause I’m ashamed
We will never meet again, look who I've became
By the way, ur ok?
I'd cry anyway and you'd threw me away

[Verse 3]
When you greet me my heart and soul freeze
And all I wanted was a hug, evеn a kiss
I'll miss your smell, your clothes, your wisdom and kindness
But thе cutest thing about you is your shyness
[Pre-Chorus]
It's not your fault, but in your silly way to walk, in your sweet way to talk that I fell in love with

[Chorus]
I will never see you again, 'cause I'm ashamed
We will never meet again, look who I’ve became
By the way, ur ok?
I’d cry anyway and you'd threw me away

When will you tell me what you think about it?
When will I accept your excuse about it?
I truly loved you and I’ll never have it again

[Bridge (Spoken)]
You were insecure when it comes to love
And you kinda knew what I wanted to mean
I would give everything to be by your side
But I don't think that way anymore
'Cause i don't wanna be friends

[Chorus]
I will never see you again, ’cause I'm ashamed
We will never meet again, look who I've became
By the way, ur ok?
I'd cry anyway and you'd threw me away
When will you tell me what you think about it?
When will I accept your excuse about it?
I truly loved you and I'll never have it again

When will you tell me what you think about it?
When will I accept your excuse about it?
I truly loved you and I'll never have it again

When will you tell me what you think about it?
When will I accept your excuse about it?
I truly loved you and I'll never have it again

Never have it again"
2258,"Concerning blood
I don't know
I don't know
And I don't care to
It feels good to be alone
It feels good to be alone

Comfortable blood
Where did it go
It died in my bones
And it's drying my bones out
It feels good to be alone
It feels good to be alone

Covered in blood
Head to your toes
Nobody knows
And nobody cares to
It feels good to be alone
It feels good to be alone"
8223,"[Verse 1]
I am hatred, seeping blood
The rain, the flood, the grief
I am rage, becoming flesh
A dismal, ravaged life
This is pain, a wall of tears
And my tears are my truest friends
This, my heart, a dying sun
A flower fading to black

[Chorus]
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?

[Verse 2]
In this darkness called my mind
The waste you left for me
I'm your shit, your verbal smut
Your twisted world recapped
This is you, your lifeless soul
Your sick and fucked-up lies
In my world, your love is death
Your disease, your skin that burns
[Chorus]
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God

[Bridge]
You tied my limbs and buried me alive
And piled this frozen mud
You watched me die with lustrous eyes
As all your words grew stale
You mocked my care and stained my mind
You yearned for me to fail

[Chorus]
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?

[Outro]
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?

2505,"under the darkened layers of silk & lush
we can commence in a push
filter through soup bowls with moss in the undertow
you unleashed the lion in me
caged barbaric creatures having little eyes
the immense silence toward its bitter violence
dark deranged dungeon with pillars of vast exploits
feeble minded zombie mutant creatures come in search of blood
in the vast perpetual time between matter and space
we get a taste of vanquished vomit in bright yellow asps
the seal on the door that leads to the underground is locked
one needs to negate the notion of spineless agitation
why does one equate logic with fear
I shed a single tear to numb the inner pain
the warden of the dungeon calmly opened to lock
only to reveal vast shivers down one's spine
a time revealed with swords of armor on the influx of its residue
we climbed in further only to discover
a draw bridge that brought creatures in to infest there mind with evil dread
the cosmic collision of a puzzle made for the walking dead
viscous fangs dripping blood off side we run away to hide
only to get closer as never before to the underground
there in the center lies a barrage of infested rodents chewing on vile matter
with a barrage of waste that taunts the madness in my mind
for i have seen enough turning to the warden he locked the door once again
at night i slept but was awakened by a viscous noise coming from under my bed
a stir of emotions came rustling through my extremeties
I was naked and all alone then the silence dissapeared to the knock on my door
for it was the warden warning me that the creatures were once again loosed in the city
I was beside myself but I realized that these creatures hated water so I came with buckets
one by one I was able to lure the creatures back to the naggot infested dwelling
all was left was a zombie that I barely couldn't see
throughout the duration of time the warden reassured me that all was well
the remedy of this madness is to have water handy then everything would be gravy."

The sound of the waves in my ear
Excuse me, could you spare a little bit of that zinc oxide?
I gotta shade my burnin' rear

Yes, and all the while they say this thing is rude
But I myself find it pretty sightly
That a man like me can be exposed to the elements
No matter if he's flabby even slightly

At the nude beach
At the nude beach

They're diggin' in the sand, the mighty sand castle
I look aloft and see a buxom lass
She is baring to all those her big old buns
I step aside and proudly let her pass

The moon shown down on you and me
The stars put on a look of pride
The river murmured to the sea

The gentle winds did sigh
One word broke nature's sweet repose
That sad word was goodbye

And tell me that you'll not forget

In vain to tell my love I tried
My heart was sad, I could not speak

I promised you I would be true
As long as I should live
The parting kiss I gave to you
Was everything I had to give

2016

[Verse 1]

I was standing in the beer garden at Evergreen Fest when a girl caught my eye and sent butterflies through my chest
She had yellow flowers in her hair and when I looked, well, shit, I couldn't help but stare
She was beauty incarnate and radiated love like an angel, a blessing, a great gift from God above
Talking to her meant that I was risking loss
But if I didn't take a chance, well
I'd never get my shot
I walked up to her
I didn't know what to say
When I opened up my mouth
My heart straight fluttered away
If I remember this feeling right
It's love at first sight and it's nice knowing I believe in it tonight
[Bridge]

I'm a dreamer
A poet
A saint
And a sinner
And this love that I'm feeling, well, it means that I'm a winner
Because I've got an old fashioned crush on an incredible girl who walked into my life and rearranged my world

[Verse 2]

I fumbled with the phone and asked her to connect
And what I did next was send a really stupid text
I didn't sound fly
In fact, I sounded, quite, well, quite nerdy
But she responded right away and, well, she was super flirty
She told me that she liked a man that knew what he wanted
I had the confidence I needed and boy was I sure happy to flaunt it
The truth was, I was a little drunk, so I had no fear
And truthfully I just wanted to wrap my arms around her and hold her near
Just to thank her for being who she was
And for evoking so many of these feelings that stir within me tonight
I'm so grateful for this life
And I want to share this gratitude to all in peace far from strife

[Verse 3]
I drove three hours just to see her again yesterday, but when she walked up next to me
I had nothing to say
It was like I was a little boy on the playground at five
When she came close, I froze up and my mind, well, it came alive
What if she doesn't like you?
What if she thinks that you're weird?
What if she hates your teeth or the way that you keep your beard
(Laughter)
I've decided, however, that none of that really matters
Because this girl likes me, too, and I'm really flattered
This is me sending out positive vibes to that Stoner Chick, Bella
And letting the world know that I'm truly a lucky fella
Because the universe brought her into my life and I've got one moment in time to rap about it tonight
So I'll seize this moment forever and let it echo into eternity
With the aide of the Internet, I'll cherish the entire journey
No matter where our friendship goes, I want her to know that she'll never need to walk this road alone

[Outro]

And this is just a dedication to her, because, well, everybody wants attention and to feel loved and wanted
And she is
So, be happy Bella and smile"

I could shoot all the blue jays I wanted, if I could hit 'em, but to remember it was a sin to kill a mockingbird...Well, I reckon because mockingbirds don't do anything but make music for us to enjoy.

Chorus (Kangol Slim):

She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love, Oh Love
She's Giving Me Love
Oh Love
First Verse (Kangol Slim):

When I was young my Mother watched me as I played
And every night she got down on her knees and to the Lord she prayed
For her son who will one day be up in this World
And that he grows old enough strong enough to watch her baby Girl
Back in those days, we all done some bad
But my Mother grabbed me by my shirt and smacked me on my back
That's one thing I can say and even the man up above
Even though my Mother spanked me she has always shown me love

Chorus

Second Verse (Kangol Slim):

When I made seven started acting kinda wild
Everybody in the neighborhood said I was a problem child
Suspended from school have to stay home for three days
It's a damned shame, everyone says I'm only in the damned third grade
But Mother did not worry, her son is still kinda young
Every night she gets down on her knees and still prays for her son
To straighten up and to start handling his biz
She said one day in the future I might have some lovely kids

Chorus
Third Verse (Kangol Slim):

Dropped out of school in only eleventh grade
Everybody says that Walter is going the wrong way
But I slowly came to see, all that life was really made of
Now I'm handling biz, got my own kids, and my own house
And still to this day
My Mother gets down and prays
For the Lord to lead me right
So I may live my life

Chorus

4803,"A lot of years ago, I was attacked by some nightmares
In which some awful fiends involved me in the arts of sin
Since those days, I led many through the dark ways of hell
Receiving as payment, all kinds of riches in this earthly life

Take my hand future Satan's child
Follow me and receive this new life

I am spell bound and DAMNED TO THE CORE
Hell bound I am. In hell I will burn. [x2]

Let’s Burn!

I've been dealing with Satan in black masses and rituals
He gave me the power and made me king to destroy any bound
All this might be yours, just chant with me this forbidden rhyme
And follow the sign that leads through the path to win

Take my hand future Satan's child
Follow me and receive this new life
I am spell bound and DAMNED TO THE CORE
Hell bound I am. In hell I will burn. [X2]
My soul will burn"

Genius is the best source for lyrics and knowledge about lyrics, and we strive to make this true for Irish music as well!Join the effortCreate your own Genius Account hereHow to get involvedSay Hi! Let us know you're here and share your enthusiasm with us (or vice versa).

Start Transcribing! There is still a lot of good music missing. Curious which artists? Have a look at our 2019 Album Release Calendar to see what new albums will drop or what still has to be transcribed. For singles, crazy projects we've started and other news, check our biweekly updates. and for a more complete view of Irish artists, check out our Artist Archive Spreadsheet

Start Tagging! Help us keep track of Irish artists on Genius and tag their songs. Our two main tags are ""Ireland"" and ""Northern Ireland"". These two can be used on every song from every artist, with Northern Ireland being for artists originally from Northern Ireland and Ireland for those from the Republic of Ireland.
We also have ""As Gaeilge"" for songs in Irish and ""Irish Folk"" for those old hits you scream sing while in the pub or at a football match (or literally anywhere else, it's good music after all).

Start Annotating! Share your in-depth knowledge of Irish music. After all, who knew that Hozier was part of Celtic music group Anuna before they read his Genius bio? Want to have something reviewed, send a message to Tossing_Dice or Chloe Conlon.

All artists from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland deserve our attention. This is not at all meant as a political statement; both regions produce artists of great quality that are sadly still under-represented on Genius. Musical traditions are closely interwoven with cooperation between artists being commonplace and most sites focusing on new Irish releases use the entire island as their talent pool. Their lists, and our lists as a consequence, show artists from both regions side by side."

I think I need a fix
Anytime when it's after dark
To get my female kicks
I don't go to Frisco
And I won't go to the beach
There's just one place I know
Where the girls just can't be beat

Carson girls
They're the cutest in the land
Carson girls
I wanna take one by the hand

One's name is DD
And the other, she plays bass
All their friends now are cuter still
I'd like to kiss them in the face

I don't care about one-night stands
Or pick-ups in a bar
All I want's the girl I love
On the back seat of my car
Carson girls
They're the cutest in the land
Carson girls
I wanna take one by the hand

Rock!

Scrunch back now!

So if you're thinking about moving west
Forget about West LA
Forget about Torrance now, baby
'Cause Carson girls are a-okay
They don't care about breaking hearts
And they don't leave guys in tears
And when they love, they never stop
Or at least that's what I hear

Carson girls
They're the cutest in the land
Carson girls
I wanna take one by the hand

To all my people in the field
Puttin work in and keepin it real
Don't make life an ordeal
Celebrate what they're tryna conceal
The miracle of the soul
Spirit never dies, only bodies get old
So I won't work for their gold
Or believe in the stories we're told
Huh, reborn as an eagle
Huh, I'm reborn as a king
Huh, grabbed the horns of the evil
Huh, rose with thorns in the spring
Huh, see it bright, one of life's secrets
Blinded by light, that's my only weakness
Huh, no more darkness, I'm leaving the frauds
Tell 'em I ain't comin back, I got a meeting with God

Huh, to all my people in the field
Tired of bullshit and keepin it real
Without a license to kill
We will die for that light on the hill
Till we're truly in bliss
In the mysteries right into the abyss
At the temple high off a spliff
Resurrected like Hiram Abiff

The streets that suffer your name

Don't store your treasures up with moth and rust, where thieves break in and steal
Pull the fangs from out your heel

See the dust of nations
Step out from time

Still we stack our stones and bury what we can
But it all will be undone, and nothing built under the sun
Will ever stand before the endless march of sand

2357,"The rain set early in tonight,
The sullen wind was soon awake,
It tore the elm-tops down for spite,
and did its worst to vex the lake:
I listened with heart fit to break.

When glided in Porphyria; straight
She shut the cold out and the storm,
And kneeled and made the cheerless grate
Blaze up, and all the cottage warm;
Which done, she rose, and from her form

Withdrew the dripping cloak and shawl,
And laid her soiled gloves by, untied
Her hat and let the damp hair fall,
And, last, she sat down by my side
And called me. When no voice replied,

She put my arm about her waist,
And made her smooth white shoulder bare,
And all her yellow hair displaced,
And, stooping, made my cheek lie there,
And spread, o’er all, her yellow hair,
Murmuring how she loved me—she
Too weak, for all her heart’s endeavor,
To set its struggling passion free
From pride, and vainer ties dissever,
And give herself to me forever.

But passion sometimes would prevail,
Nor could tonight’s gay feast restrain
A sudden thought of one so pale
For love of her, and all in vain:
So, she was come through wind and rain.

Be sure I looked up at her eyes
Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshiped me: surprise
Made my heart swell, and still it grew
While I debated what to do.

That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around,

And strangled her. No pain felt she;
I am quite sure she felt no pain.
As a shut bud that holds a bee,
I warily oped her lids: again
Laughed the blue eyes without a stain.
And I untightened next the tress
About her neck; her cheek once more
Blushed bright beneath my burning kiss:
I propped her head up as before
Only, this time my shoulder bore

Her head, which droops upon it still:
The smiling rosy little head,
So glad it has its utmost will,
That all it scorned at once is fled,
And I, its love, am gained instead!

Porphyria’s love: she guessed not how
Her darling one wish would be heard.
And thus we sit together now,
And all night long we have not stirred,
And yet God has not said a word!"
9012,"Near the end, tonight
I was reading in her mind
Feel the hate inside
It was burning in her eyes…
The War is over tonight
Between the two of us
We made a promise but now
We feed this tragic love
The war is over tonight
And leave the cry behind
My heart is broken , I feel it
And we will never change
See the future, my dear
How d’you think that we could last?
We meant forever, one time
Drеams are falling, tell me why"
3716,"[Verse 1]
It might be heaven
If you loved me without all the loopholes
Spell out the letters
But I'm reading them back just for you
I don't know why I do
It might be heaven
If the knife in my arm didn't pin me
We're in my bedroom
But this feels like the last time you'll win
Things end where they begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna think about it anymore, it's useless
Baby you already know, the truth is we're through it
Lock the door behind you
Something awful, it's your blueprint
Everything in flamеs, you're killing cupid

[Chorus]
It might be heavеn
In a fever dream, nothing's what it seems (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
It's getting reckless
Playing make-believe, ripping at the seams (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
Don't try and tell me it's heavenly
Better be, sure you don't want this 'cause nothing's for free
It's never heaven
When you don't really get what you see
[Verse 2]
Why won't you fold?
There's really not a point in lying
Got so cold
Laugh in my face when I'm dying
Keep it close

I don't wanna think about it anymore, it's useless
Baby you already know
The truth is we're through it
Lock the door behind you
Something awful, it's your blueprint
Everything in flames, you're killing cupid

[Chorus]
It might be heaven
In a fever dream, nothing's what it seems (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
It's getting reckless
Playing make-believe, ripping at the seams (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah)
Don't try and tell me it's heavenly
Better be, sure you don't want this 'cause nothing's for free
It's never heaven
When you don't really get what you see"

Drown your sorrows in whisky
And fill yourself with cheer
Drown your sorrows in whisky
While your wife's at the galleria
There ain't no painkiller comparable
To a good old dose of ethanol
So drown your sorrows in whisky
And forget that you exist
Oh, drown your sorrows in whisky
And forget that you exist"

Dear love you're always in my head and I won't try to pretend

Hey love you take away my breath with your lips so perfectly red
Yeah, I have no defense against all your beauty
So I need you to be kind
If you need me in your life
Won't you please give me a sign
Cause if your hearts not in it then

Chorus
I will be the one, will be the one to let you run
I will be the one, will be the one to let you run

And I will be the one, will be the one to let you run

You're walking my way

[CNN Clip]

A White House report that says global warming affects every part of the US.

Obama: This isn't something in the distant future. Climate change is something that is affecting us now.

John Oliver: Now. Smart move Obama. That is a key shift in how to talk about climate change. Because we've already proven we cannot be trusted with the future tense. We've been repeatedly asked, don't you want to leave a better Earth for your children? And we've all answered, ah fuck em.

But incredibly, this latest damning scientific report may still face an uphill climb with some of us.

[MSNBC Clip]

There was that Gallup poll that came out last month that found that one in four Americans think Climate Change doesn't matter and thinks this issue has been exaggerated.

John Oliver: Who gives a shit? You don't need people's opinions on a fact."

Funny how I made off
Lookin' at my peers as I take off
Says she got another chick for me I should wait on (Woo)
Lookin' for a JLo, bad little some' I could take home
California king, you can lay on

Got a man, but she creepin'
Don't get caught up in the deep end (Ha)

'Cause we don't really care, don't care, we don't really care, don't care, girls just wanna have fun
Girls just wanna have fun fun (Yeah, T-Raww, JLo, this that shit though)"

The trouble I'm making
We’ve made it together
When visits in daydreams
This place goes on forever
Bury me in my stone heart
A dreamer's eyes never seemed so dull
Where do wanderers die when they have
No place left to go?

[Chorus]
It never bothered you
That I was so far away
And if you asked me to
I'd have left home that day

[Verse 2]
An empty party
Leave when no one is watching
An empty body
Is it a dream if it still haunts me?
Stare at the sun
A lover’s eyes never seemed so numb
Where do cowards die when they have
No place left to run?
[Chorus]
Yeah, it never bothered you
That I was so far away
And if you asked me to
I'd have left home that day
If it's the same to you
Then we can stay this way
But if you asked me to
I'd have left home that day"
9993,"My name is Malcolm McLaren
I have brought you many things in my time
But the most successful of all
Was an invention of mine they called punk rock

Ah, let me start from the beginning
Find just four kids
Make sure they hate each other
Make sure they can't play

There was Steve Jones
Eighteen years of age
A brilliant cat burglar
I nominated him guitarist

Ah, there was another fellow, Paul Cook
Seventeen years of age
A phenomenal acrobat in A-1 condition
Always on time, he had to provide the beats

Lurking in the corner of the shop
I noticed this Dickensian figure
Had it not been for his green hair
I’d have thought him
Something out of “David Copperfield”
I took the opportunity of confronting him
He pretended to think me an idiot, pushed me aside
When I learned he was Irish
And Steve saw his green teeth
We called him Johnny Rotten
Then there was Sidney, with a natural terrorist
Working in the clubs ensured him
That every gig the group played
Ended up in an unpredictable, bloody mess
Bashing and jumping all about
He invented the Pogo

I call them the Sex Pistols

With the line-up complete
We immediately set about
Putting our plan into effect
To swindle our way
To the top of the Rock ’n’ Roll industry
It was a plan that within two years
Was to bring us close to a million pounds"

But nothing affects me, someone direct me
To the part where it lets me feel like it gets me

Im under duress, im over the rest
I do whats best, am i makin a mess
You can confess, this isnt a test

For sarcasm and ironic concession
Thats ok cos it taught me a lesson
And i'll never share with you ever again
Object of affection
Target of obsession
Self-aware regression
And i am left with aggression

Im so young im so dumb
Let me see what else i can rhyme with cum
Another metaphor with a blowjob pun
Yet another verse inspired by gay porn
My names not buzzin but he said he was bustin
A nut while he was listening to one of my songs
That really makes me say damn son

One trick pony but im winning the derby

On the door, who could it be?
Puffy jacket badman
Wants his money
Ripped down the door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well, I, I never expected it from you
Someone I always thought I knew
And it's true, the demise of the skies came through
And shit's about to go down like the Titanic

Young, dumb, living off Mum
Waiting for the right time to come
The best bet's getting you when you're all alone

The best bet's getting you when you're all alone
Unknown number, don't pick up the phone

Stepson's father, brother's next door neighbour's riddle
Cause we heard his wife was having a little bit of a fiddle
On the side, hands held wide, tight at the side
Couldn't get sober but at least she tried
And it ain't all over till the fa-a-a- sings
And even then, the fight's still yet to begin
It's a no-win city but isn't it a pity
Why the fuck do rela-a-a-ationships be so tricky?

Waiting for the right time to come

Take a look into the broken mirror
Before the storm clouds and the night get nearer
Shards of glass makes the sight unclear
But we're 'bout to move into a golden era
Street lights are blinding - hypnotizing
Feel like they're trying to, stop me from finding
Keep left and there's only one way
Into the horizon the path keeps winding
But there's one thing I definitely know
At the end of time, there'll be judgment of the soul
And the only thing that's accountable
Is everything you are, not everything you own
Don't be so selfish
You don't know the hell this created all the needy and the helpless
Pride on the shelf bitch
Our music's free - we don't need to sell this.. so why do they say I'm..

[Hook: DMB]
Selfish, cause I'm not
Everything I have I would gladly give up
[Verse 2: Elusive]
I thought I had it figured out, but no
I guess life's not ready to let me, let go
On the surface, I might seem calm
But on the inside I feel like I'm gonna explode
I don't even know how to explain it
In terms you might understand
So I write these songs, to try to figure it out myself
And if I ever do, then you will be the first to know
But if I do blow, up
Then I guess it just must be a by-product of growth
And until then this industry is
Gonna try to keep on fucking us both
Cause II Kings ain't ever selling out
I would rather sell fish
But I make each one of these songs for you
So don't you ever try to say I'm..

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMB (w/ Elusive)]
I would give up everything I earn
As long as I remember everything I learn
(Cause the things I gave up that mattered most to me)
(I know will one day return)
And that day is coming so soon
If you don't prepare then it's gonna consume
(Your body, like a werewolf)
(In the night underneath the full moon)
I'm lost, chasing a shadow
I feel like I just can't escape from this battle
(I'd been knocked down)
(But I'm 'bout to swallow my pride and jump straight back on that saddle)
But now that I know where I'm going
There's no need to pack my satchel
(Some might think I am lost)
(But I would rather that they think that than say I'm..)

You just in the car, man
It's like when you're in the car you just
You just think about everything, man
Definitely when you like, you by yourself
And you just cruising on the highway, man
Yeah, this, this, this got me thinking

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm smoking on that cat piss
Swerving through traffic, listening to trap shit
My windows ain't tinted, so niggas notice me
Four braids, Yankee fitted, yeah, niggas know it's me
I'm everywhere comfortable, but I'm still attentive
A young nigga with money will make niggas offended
I ain't flashy, I'm classy, but I ain't stupid either
Never show off to niggas that's hungry and eager
My brother's keeper, I'm loyal, it's all in my demeanor
A true believer, I believe when they didn't believe her
That's why I don't let opinions affect me
I do what I wanna do, if they do or they don't accept me
They expect me to give up, I almost did
Things went from moving fast to slow motion
I was losing focus, stuck on that evil potion
It was smooth on the surface, but underneath it was broken
Hoping to find hope in this hopeless world we live in
What you give is what you given, gotta make wise decisions
Gotta stay tunnel vision, gotta avoid collision
Keep scratching the surface and keep your palms itching
Gotta pay moms a visit, damn, it's been awhile
I been working, she keep telling me she miss her child
I find myself passing her house, then I spin around
She say I'm always movin', ma, I just can't sit around
On my ass 'cause the cash ain't gon' come to us
When we was down, who gave a dime or gave a fuck for us?
So instead of makin' it hard, I made it fun for us
Make it easy, so when you need it, you just run to us
But it's a lot of pressure, I'm tryna stick and move through this shit
Fixing these bumps in the road so I can just cruise to this shit
Livin' my life on the road, I'm tryna get used to this shit
And when they throw dirt, I just act like a broom to this shit
Tryna stay true to this shit, even when they lie on me
World on my shoulders, my girl can't even cry on me
God watching over me, the devil probably spy on me
I been going through some shit, Kenneth keep an eye on me
I know it's been a drought, but to my fans, don't go dry on me
If you want a picture, take a picture, don't get shy on me
I'm here to inspire, I admire that you admire me
I been in the dark, but I promise you'll see a brighter me
I'm sorry
[Interlude]

I love y'all
I just wanna say thank you
For supporting me since day one
These motherfuckers don't wanna see me win, man
I don't know why, but we gon' win anyway

Boy, I swear I couldn't leave that mic alone

Can't be a loser, I maneuver like I got a clone
I'm out here in these streets like I ain't got a home
And you barely hear from me like I ain't got a phone
'Cause it's no days off, it's no days off
I know it sounds a little painful, but it pays off
Social sites was distracting so I stayed off
Spoke to God, then me and satan had a face off
I swear my life was like a rocket, then it takes off
First I plotted, then I got it, couldn't wait long
I put the pedal to the metal, then took the brakes off
And I kept it A1 like the steak sauce
My paychecks use to be a pair of Jordans
And I know I can't afford 'em, but I went ahead and bought 'em
Then I quit, started slangin', spent my money on recordin'
Yeah, the studio was small, but man, that shit made me a fortune

Still got mad love for a record called Beat Bop
It mean a lot spinnin' on my Walkman
Shout out to the Afrika Bam'
And to the S to the P the double-O-N-Y
The one MC, who you can't deny
I'd listen to the records and they'd inspire
Sit down to write and the pen blazed fire
Construct a rhyme with specific intent
Flowin' from the braincells right through the pen
And then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic
Words flowin' so cold, turn water to ice
Come through the wire saturate the tape
You put me in the mix nice it up at the plate
And then they press it on wax, sell it in the store
The DJ's spin the record out on the dancefloor
Comin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum

Lost what we found, but the weight
Has fallen from our shoulders now (Shoulders now)

The rain falls harder now (Harder now)
Don’t make a sound, it’s okay
It’s out of our control for now

And before I let you go
I just want to let you know

Thank you for the letters that you wrote
And thank you for the loving words you spoke
I’m sorry for the promises I broke

Our hearts will keep on beating like before
And our bodies will survive through the cold
I’m sorry that I had to let this go
But I think that I was meant to be alone

On the other side but it ain't true
Oh no, it didn't last for more than days

I rocked the whole foundation
Of the world, the world where I was born
Oh no, it didn't even shake the way it should

I burned the bridges, set the place on fire
And turned my back on you
Oh no, I was a fool in every way

My heroes were all masters in the
Art of leaving troubles all behind
Oh no, but they were blind for what they left

I was a quitter, I ran away
Whenever troubles crossed my way
I didn't know what I left
I only knew how to run away
They raised me with the myth of being a loner
No matter what the price
Oh no, I was a chump for all those years

The shortest way was always to the door
And someone said, ""Don't look back""
Oh no, and so I didn't 'til today

I was a quitter, I ran away
Whenever troubles crossed my way
I didn't know what I left
I only knew how to run away"

Today, I tried to call, but all I got was just the normal
Voice I've always heard, it wasn’t yours, but I had to wonder
If I heard your voice again, what would I say to you?
I don't know
And after all this time, I see your face in every corner
How could I forget the way we laughed through every moment?
I hate to think that you've moved on and found another one
To hold onto

And every time I hear your name
I think about us dancin’ in the rain (Oh)
I wonder if you wanna say
I miss her when you look into her face
'Cause we've been through so much
I can't explain how bad I wanted you to stay
So do you еver think of me
Or has evеry memory just gone away?

Oh
Oh, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in California?
Stayin' up all night and always gettin' into trouble

That we used to

Broad, some time ago
Odd, how long I lasted
Angry, full of hatred

In the snow, we looked so crazy
Wrecking balls, our every footstep crushing
And oh, I finally see you
Closer, broad, expanding
A white sheet, no more haunting
The wrestle, fist & palm
The cold
My home

From the palms, your broad arms
Open your hands
Open your…

In the yard, I see you smiling
So why am I so sad?
Sometimes in moments of quiet
I remember your face and I feel unhappy
How did I make it so hard to love me?
And why is it so hard?
Why is it so hard?
To care for you?
To love you"

Open up ya eyes and watch a sunrise
On a better day
So we can make a way for the better
Workin' together
We need to set a
Few things straight
Open ya mouth and communicate to Hak
The happy-go-lucky type of fella
Thinkin' of layin' on the beach being mellow
Watching the sun go down as it gets dark
Walking on the sand, footprints make a mark
To show my steps
And just where I have been
Thinkin' of my life and figure will I ever win this game? (game)
Nothing's the same
People of the world wanna act insane
With the crazy thoughts (crazy thoughts) and the crazy ways (crazy)

Bad news
Every other day, another pass away before his time
So tell me can I find
A place of peace and harmony and love?
It got me thinkin' damn
I'm really sick and tired of people
Robbin' and shootin'
Killin' and lootin'
Rootin' and tootin'
And never thinkin' about who's in the ground
Six feet under
Now doesn't that really make you wonder
About a killin' in a city?
Your next door neighboor screamin'
""Why oh why did my son die?""
Life in the fast lane
Throwin' up gang signs
Drugs can kill minds, and I can't take this
Turn on the news to hear about rapists
But you can't hear it 'cause of gun shots outside
Nobody's helpin'
No one's tryin'
No joke, loc

Thinkin' bout the times we chill in the mall
Just buggin' (buggin')
Or maybe out clubbin'
Clownin' around or actin' a fool
I never had a worry when I was with you
Now I don't understand why you would go away
Now I know, (there's a better day)
I'm gonna do what I gotta do (Aw yeah, word to mom)
I know one day, we're gonna be with you (Oh yeah)
Havin' a ball, like we used to
Why did it have to be you? (Oh baby)

We gotta stick together as one
So we can have a ton of fun (Ooh yeah)

You got me cryin', again (Can't you see the tears?)

This world is so messed up
Don't worry 'bout a thang, little bro
'Cause uh, (The good days are comin')

Don't have to worry (The good days are comin')
Never gonna worry (The good days are comin')
No need to worry (The good days are comin')

Walking down a dark road there ain't a detour
All my demons waiting I've been here before
My bodies sore, I can't fight no more
Molly mixing with my pain
Purple rain I'll never do again
It's the same it's driving me insane
All alone, I'm the one to blame
Fuck the money and the fame, aye

[Verse]
I'm digging a grave, fill it with shame
There ain't no body in it
There's just molly in it
She's a hottie ain't it
Cloud my judgment when I'm with her but I love to hate it
Getting way too faded, getting way too jaded
Almost signed my life away damn this girl persuading
Life always finds a way
Drugs always finds a way
Love always finds a way
Took too much I wanna fly away, aye
Wonder will I die today? Hey, let's not think about it
In this life, you go through cycles wonder what's changed about it
Damn, I might be thinking too hard, wait I'm skipping parts

[Chorus]
Walking down a dark road there ain't a detour
All my demons waiting I've been here before
My bodies sore, I can't fight no more
Molly water, mix it with my pain
Purple rain, I'll never do again
It's the same it's driving me insane
All alone, I'm the one to blame

[Verse]
I'm hanging out with Debbie I had to dump Molly
I know she probably mad at me do I care hardly
Got to do what's best for me I'll tell her that I'm sorry, oh
These drugs are messing with my body
Overdose in my class couldn't make it to the bathroom
I had popped like eight pills probably was a bad move
Can't get mad on my part I was in a bad mood, aye
Imma get a tattoo, Lonely Stoner till the day I die
Which is real soon, going up up up like a free balloon
These shorties out here pick and choose they don't want a real dude
Who am I to judge I don't think I'm real too
I think I found my soulmate she said she pop pills too
Oh nevermind wait I think I was dreaming, damn
I think I was dreaming
[Chorus]
Walking down a dark road there ain't a detour
All my demons waiting I've been here before
My bodies sore, I can't fight no more
Molly water, mix it with my pain
Purple rain, I'll never do again
It's the same it's driving me insane
All alone, I'm the one to blame"

I see you for a while
I've been wasting love
You don't hear me now
I've been calling up
You think I got it all
I don't have enough
Used to all my lies
Why'd you call?

Wish you could love me
Wish you could love me

Got into some bad love
Now my heart's a mess
Got into some bad love

Two rules for me to trust
I thought you couldn't know
But I just wish you had forever

You never judged me
I wish you could love me

Now my heart's a mess

I'm walking to my promised land
Been talking and talked to
The devil he's at my right hand
And Jesus too
Waiting to help and

Waiting for my answers
Waiting for my prayer to find me there
Promised land

I'm walking through every shire
I pray that I will be received
The hate that she inspires
Has to be seen to be believed
And yet so scared
Witless and wondering

Every man is frightened
Praying for enlightened days ahead
Promised land
Walk on freedom shore
Won't see me again
See me no more
Gone to my promised land"

Always the war in 1983

Every day, dreams to go to a better life
But they remain only dreams

You are the children
Your life will be very hard
You are the children
You're singing every day

To have a friend to explain your little problem
Can you say now to have it?
Sometimes you hope it's only an illusion
Don't hope, it's better so
But children-power will win, I am sure
With sweet, sweet lovin' for us
Your fantasy will find new nice colour
But now it's time to go

You are the children
Your life will be very hard
You are the children
You're singing every day

Your life will be very hard

Angels, answer me
Are you near if rain should fall?
Am I to believe
You will rise to calm the storm?
For so great a treasure words will never do
Surely, if this is
Promises are mine to give you
Mine to give

Here, all too soon the day!
Wish the moon to fall and alter out tomorrow
I should know
Heaven has her way
Each one given memories to own

Should you move both earth and sea
Angeles, I could feel
All those dark clouds disappearing

Or was you gonna just know how to bust flows on the low and just go for the gusto

Thought you'd be good but then nehh
You proved me so wrong
At that I just laugh
This backpack rap, a blast from the past
To all these cats that be backing your tracks
Keep it a rack
What you're backing is whack
You practically brag, on every song with no actual stacks
'Bout a bag, but no actual bags
'Bout you raps, with no actual bars
'Bout your cars, with no actual gas
That you still say you whipping for real
You ain't dope gripping the steel
You couldn't kill me while gripping the steel

Triple entendre so listen

With each additions no difference, woah

Then blow it like you splurged on something
Leave you wide-eyed, jaw dropped, froze like your mom turned around while you was in the middle of flipping the bird or something
You see, I can verbally murder something
Or touch your soul like the word or something
Lines held over your head like dirt or something
With this mic you Tamir rice merked for nothing
You light work it's nothing
It'll only take a second like a person who was not quite first something

Just another night singing songs about you
Burning up my heels and lighting up a song
Goin' far on little just a little too long

Well, the sun's coming up and my eyes are peeled
On a stretch of road straighter than I keep the wheel
My heart made a u-turn a few years back
But my head said, ""Why turn? You never look back""

Drove a hundred thousand miles, never looked under a hood
When I finally did I found a rabbit's foot
Two crossed fingers and an old horseshoe
And a book full of songs about missing you

Now I'm feeling like a lizard when my blood runs cold
At the thought of sleeping all alone tonight
For nine days, six lanes, and eleven state lines

Only drink hard liquor if you're payin' or I'm losin'
But I'm losing my mind nearly every single day
'Cause we're making good time and we're getting no pay

Armadillo, ocotillo, and a prickly pear
I spent half the day with a dumb blank stare
And the other half hurrying to nowhere
Now I can't hear the fiddle but the techie don't care

Well, I'm yawning like a pup at the rising sun
At the edge of a cliff with a hitcher's thumb
Stars in my eyes even when they don't shine
And a heart that's harder than a bristlecone pine

Well, just another night doing wrong without you
Just another night singing songs about you
Burning up my heels, lighting up a song
Goin' far on little just a little too long

They feel intimidated by me
Here they go fucking up some commas (They feel nervous man)
They feel too attracted to me

Wait 'till you see so many blowing up (Blowing up!)
I'm just like Braveheart running like crazy
So I can have my fellowmen rising up (What's your style?)

I’m the white Dr. Dre, the male Jennifer Lopez
I wanna be like Donald man, Childish Gambino

How about young little dipshit? (Dip dip)
Young little douchebag with a skrrt, I flex for a music video
Acting like I have a private chauffeur (Skrrt skrrt)
'Cause status is what the so-called fans prefer
Moving in your chair must be some kinda stir (Some kinda stir)
Just get up and dance to my new tune, it's not my perfume
It's the aroma of confidence that I exhume (Exhume)
I'm an eagle, I'm an Aries, I'm a rat
3 number 1's should not be legal
Being such a nice guy is deceitful (Deceitful)
'Cause I'm usually peaceful (Peaceful)
But if you get me mad I go fucking lethal (Lethal)
With a shotgun shotgun (Shotgun)
I apologize I got a little carried away there for a second
I don't like to scream or make a fuzz over small things
But I did call shotgun (Shotgun)

Nobody cares about it, nobody cares about it

They're all gonna know me someday
Well you got what you wanted
But look at you now
You lost something good on the way
So where did it go
Tell me where did it go
But you wouldn't know

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?

Now everything seems to be going your way
And everyone loves what they see
But you ruin it all with the things that you say
So tell me how does it feel
When you're all alone
How does it feel
You're alone
Nothing is real
Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?
You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become
All the things you despise
But I know who you are
And you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are ?

You can keep all your dreams
But you don't have to lose yourself
Cos one day you're gonna break
When the face in the mirror
Looking back at you's
A stranger that you can't place
Just who do you think you are ?

Snap your fingers and somebody runs
You don't care how they feel
Just as long as they come
Got your head in the stars
Now you've come this far
Just who do you think you are ?
You believe a ridiculous lie
You can't see you've become
All the things you despise
But I know who you are
And you've gone too far
Just who do you think you are ?"

Under their watchful eyes
Who mass-conditioned the media
To believe their fool-proof lies
I sought to enlighten;
Bring the system to an end
Through the mold of society
The freed minds would transcend
Amass the insurrection!!!
Disprove their prophecy
The day we let them own our minds
Is the day of our decease
Amass the insurrection!!!
Conduct in clandestine
Wrest power back to the people
State of insurgency
When I refused to acknowledge
Their proclamations I'd negate
Ostracized victim of a thinking mind
Turned enemy of the state
They've brought and sold intelligence
Apathy was our defect
It's over now, they've won the war
Globalization's in full effect
Amass the insurrection!!!
Target the Illuminati
Destroy the manipulation
That's lasted for centuries
Amass the Insurrection!!!
Conduct in clandestine
Wrest power back to the people
State of insurgency!!!
Cut off the head and the body will perish
I curse you; spineless populace;
Who let freedom of thought be lost
Demanded by these mislead sheep
To invade at any cost...
They've taken the new world
The ""Amero"" is our defeat

Cause this world's run by the elite
History will repeat itself

Buried deep, hidden, denied"

Got my license and a seat in the front
While you're driving better watch out for bumps
It's an elephant cuz the trunk in the front

Let me hear your story
Say it from the start
Tell me about your anger
Tell it from your heart
I know how it feels
They don't want us to take part
But we build our own thing, baby
Do it with your art

I love your confidence
How you do it and don't think about the consequence
That got me scared to death
We can't use you exposing our false pretense

You're the future, the mute
You don't make no sense
You're the truth no
Matter how gruesome it gets

There's beauty in your honesty
Won't feel with false modesty
Resist when they try to make a life a commodity

We live life, no apologies
Giving life to our wildest dreams
We live life, no apologies
We are here 'till we finally freeze

[Chorus]
Tattoo the city
Tattoo the city with your name
Tattoo the city
Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, let me know your pain
Tattoo the city
Tattoo the city with your name

Pins and needles, needles like pens
Pressed against the flesh of the evening
It's bleeding in a sense
Dripping, we leave our innocence

Sometimes, slipping, we leave our fingerprints
But, can't be discouraged
Gotta nourish our uniqueness
Deep in that tunnel we discover our secrets

Our habitat is the wrong side of the tracks
Outlaw but the law don't side with the facts, so

We living in that little glitch
Between time and space
The place that don't exist

Really we that little ich
You can't scratch if you do
You get pushed to the edge
And might question everything you been taking for granted
I have foundation solid, your walls are padded
You might discover that you've also had it
But don't be scared, ain't no cause for panic, just

[Chorus]
Tattoo the city
Tattoo the city with your name
Tattoo the city

Talk to me, baby
Talk to me, let me know your pain
Tattoo the city
Tattoo the city with your name"

But decadence has me
Meth and merlot

In this powerless frenzy

I'm in the bathroom crushing up valium
But in a fucked up way

In this frozen metaphase
Chasing dragons through and aluminum world
Of razor blades
A skin popped ripping
'cause i'm in a trash can digging for answers
Digging through shit for a hit in a coked up wet dream
Finding nothing, nothing, nothing
The circus is back in town and i know where to go

Desensitized to my own life
With no useful memory

Counting on accidents to get me by
Getting high

Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you

Fear clouds my mind
As we touch the desolate grounds, purged of all its life
The Didact himself stands upon his pedestal and with his might he pulls me forth

Awakening from cryosleep I vomit forth the medication
Proceeding to my throne, to oversee the devastation
Upon arrival, I sensed something was wrong; the air was rotten with the stench of stagnant death

Responding with force, elimination begins
Slashing and stabbing their way into our bodies, tearing out our vocal chords and replacing our minds
Handed over to the mind that binds

Overtaken we are
Proceeding to the vessel we had just arrived on
The possession; unable to be broken free
No time to figure out what is happening to me

Struggling to scream
Lungs itching from the strain; extreme agony
Attempting to destroy the internal captor I press the blade to my throat
My body has no reaction, I remain alive
Failure in motion; paralyzed
Their might cannot be triumphed
Now we pay the price for letting them go it alone

My body marches to the throne
Actions present, mind vacant
I sit surrounded by my crew
They are twisted, contorted
Their suffering; blatant

Begin the exterimation
The invoking
The execution of worlds

Me
A mere manipular forced to fight
Forced to face the horrors of our plight
I can hear them
Inside my head...their voices
Me
A speck of dirt on the tree of life
A subject of the deepest known blight
I can hear them
Inside my head...their voices

7490,"There is a change—and I am poor;
Your love hath been, nor long ago,
A fountain at my fond heart's door,
Whose only business was to flow;
And flow it did; not taking heed
Of its own bounty, or my need.

What happy moments did I count!
Blest was I then all bliss above!
Now, for that consecrated fount
Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,
What have I? shall I dare to tell?
A comfortless and hidden well.

A well of love—it may be deep—
I trust it is,—and never dry:
What matter? if the waters sleep
In silence and obscurity.
—Such change, and at the very door
Of my fond heart, hath made me poor."

He's the Savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts He will dwell
God is in us, God is for us, God is with us

You're the Savior we have been praying for
In our humble hearts You will dwell
You are in us, You are for us, You are with us, Emmanuel"

See I'm the youngest prophet to burn up all these prophets

Start saying something maybe us lyrisicts will shut it

Too forgiving on this n imma pull the trigger
I ain't Goku just saying stop mumble oh my goodness I'm bout to crumble you

I'm trynna to pick you up your life the tumblers aren't moving

Proving that your trash is just improving in the state of losing

[switch cadence]

People drinking this boozin then everybody is losing

And people stuck up here drinking and nobody's even thinking now

Back to what I was saying
Y'all rappers are up here playing

Our families need some praying
And evil needs delaying

Cause all I see is the slaying
Cause all I see is betraying
Cause all I see is the killing
Cause all I see is decaying

Don't let your body betray you with this physical torment

It's mind over matter, got my mind over my matter
Mind over matter, got my mind over matter, yeah

Heartache, backache, toothache and headache, vexation of the spirit
Cigarette burns, cold showers for hours, my training helps me through it
People with weak hearts should go into training, I don't let pain deter me
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but they will never hurt me

It's mind over matter, got my mind over my matter

If you're mind ain't made up yet, now's the time to make a move

She'll be gone, long gone

Shorty put down the books and picked up the Smith and Wesson
He really can't hustle plus the nigga with the bag won't hit him
Now he out here tryna catch a nigga slippin'
Get it how you live with how everybody keep tellin' him
Not even sixteen, damn near got three felonies
Dropped out of school and want shit but an attempt
And to make it worse he finna have a baby by trick
No guidance, thinkin' with his dick
Never had the OGs to tell him shit
Now the word around town he takin' hits
He came up in church like grimy as a git

Hard times will make a nigga do you broad day
Hard times have a nigga out here job huntin'

Hard times will make a nigga shake somethin' down
Hard times will make a nigga spray somethin' down
Hard times got these lil' kids droppin' out
Hard times got these fake niggas plottin' now

Her daddy wasn't around now she want her own nigga
Her mamma always workin', she don't get along with her
Now she tryna get did right by the wrong nigga
He got the perfect plan he gon' hit the road with her
She thinkin' it's the perfect time to make her own pennies
But he ain't even goin' though he finna send his mans
And she ain't even know it that's when shit hit the fan
Car pulled over, officer say he smelled weed
Stripped the whole car found a thousand somethin' beans
But she ain't finna tell she gon' take it for the team
Give baby five years she wasn't shit but seventeen

In faithfulness will we sit down
For our garments, His salvation
Everlasting joy, our crown

A Man of sorrows He will be
Cruelly pierced for our transgressions
Crushed for our iniquities
But His wounds are for our healings
And His punishment our peace
He'll bind up the brokenhearted
Grant the captives their release

Her hair was a mess

She looked like a star

On the dash of her car

Was just a borе

He took a mouthful of reds

From his sisters drawer

The doc put tubes inside of his nose

They pumped his stomach

That's the way it goes

He took a cigarette case

From inside of his purse

Talked like a queen and

Said his brother was worse

I may look tough

On my scuffed sunglasses

But she had a collection
Of backstage passes

Songs that curse

Drawing pictures in blood

While riding the bus

I may look tough

But I feel so beat

In my 45-G's

Fashions of the street

She was cold and young

Coming up the street

She wore a swastika

And it looked so sweet

Her hair was long

Blonde and soft

She smiled at me

So I flipped her off

Bout to steal your spot like when niggas pickpockets
I am not a trend Shaq Bruce is a real topic of discussion
Not the good guy your brother
These same ones were not around when I had nothing
These same ones will use you up and they’ll leave you rusted
If not your team or friends then who do you trust in
I lost religion many times but I pray often
I had to bring it up, god he thinks I’m good enough
Teanna thinks the musics tuff, I still can’t give her all my love
Cause everything is looking up, the one so there can’t be an us
I’m good but I just need some luck, hey Dr. Dre we need to talk
So I can make it on detox
Get some Nike checks, make classics like Reebok

Just tryna make you cop like Mike Jordan when his shoes drop

Give me the Lambos and the rings

Give me the frames and keep the change

Everything’s subliminal nobody says names
I promise that I’ll take you to school like LeBron James
Thinking shits sweet, just tryna make the cut like when wrists bleed
But don't you want it that badly or is it just me?
If it wasn’t for salary would you hear beats?
The bar gets higher and higher but shit I still reach
I don’t stop, that’s why the targets on me like red dots
And progression kills time like dead clocks
I’m businessman full send I invest in the best stocks
Performance on high while the rest talk
On my 50 cent power shit from time while the rest watch
And my struggle ain’t catching leaking ceilings with pots
But I struggle all the same can’t break even with costs
I bounce back from hard lessons what you see as a loss

A bourbon neat and whichever beer is colder
Just one for me, and one for you

Know me for who I am and why I do

And if I knew any better, I'd know it's a sin
Some things are just better without you knowin' them
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
Some things are just better without you knowin' them

[Verse 3]
Drinkin' Very Old Barton with the country radio
Always lonesome, and too prideful to show
Have another go-'round, don't mind if I do
It's just one of those things we all go through
It's just one of those things we all go through"

I want you to be
My song of love
You are in my mind
Day and night
I will buy seven roses for you
So you know
Every day of the week
That I love you
And want you to be mine"

Loco to the bone, chillin' at home, all alone
There go the ring of the phone, I pick it up slow
Just when I thought ""this'll hit"" in I'm ready to go
Throw on my black and my red, I'm broke as fuck
But that could all change with a little bit of luck
Ya'll crying motherfuckers ain't shit, talk shit
When I scream in your face ""get buck""
Bitches pretending they don't really see me
Till they saw my face up on the T-V
Kill a bad man, kill a better man, don't mean a thang
As long as the gun of the reaper
Put a bullet straight through my brain
Watch me regenerate, only I'm twice as insane
I'm coming for your wife and I'll grab a burrito as soon as I get paid

Mask on, with a red magnum in your fucking desk

Fill my lungs with tree

Im a dog & theres fleas
Bloodsuckers keep em off of me
Smoke exotic leaves living comfortably
Get a girl who gets me
Need a wish like timmy really knew a vicky
She was always sticky real freak
Used to fuck for weed
Had thе best personality was cool peeps
Til she fеll to wolves dressed like sheep
I still wake up I can't sleep
And when I do that I over think
Need a smoke & a drink maybe hit a pussy so pink
Have her wet like a sink take it all & don't scream

Work your body like a tool make a nigga act a fool
Its not me its you its just 1 not 2
But what you wanna do say the word we'll undo
Recoup and ​regroup
Wanna be next to you
Don't split I know you're flexible
I say I love you you say I'm incapable

Can't find my heart its untraceable
Beat the pussy up like its unbreakable

Older than I could ever be
Yet still Stranded in nostalgia

Stand up
Stand up

I'll climb El Capitan
And jump off to cheers from the crowd
Stand up
Stand up
And stand down
And I hope you take your camera
To photograph my tears as they hit the ground
No one even listens
The same way that no one ever laughs
I'm digging the car out of the snow
I'm wondering where the summer went to
Circled by your secrets
I'm hoping they don't include me
At least i'm in good company
Because there's no one else around
Except me
Stand up
Stand up
And stand down
I'll climb El Capitan
And jump off to cheers from the crowd
Stand up
Stand up
And stand down
And I hope you take your camera
Silence makes the loudest tap
You were looking at pictures in the distance
Hoping to see the future in your pictures
Of the distance hoping to see
The future looking at pictures in the distance
Hoping to see the future through your pictures
Of the distance
Hoping to see
The future in your pictures of the distance"

Ah, it seems you finally caught yours

Last seen with a friend and a family member
Pitch black outside, bright white indoors
Come back inside

Pictured here with a throat that would deliver
A fist of nails and a harrowing tale
And what a tale you told

You ran outside and caught the moon
I knew then and there I'd never catch up to you

When you ran outside and caught the moon
I knew then and there I'd never catch up to you

You may not have been able to change the world
But at least you changed my world
You may not have been able to change the world

They’re going do or die, who will make it out alive?
Moments will be cherished, some will perish, and then some survive
Load up a gun, taking a knife
Wiping the sweat, chest feeling tight
No time to run, only to fight
Seeing the enemy flee in the sights
They give their flesh and bone, leaders watching from their thrones
Battles never ending, the depression will be coming home
Scary days, rarely safe, leaders will deceive the brave
All to make some profits for their pockets, they should be ashamed, yeah

[Chorus]
Why we gotta kill? Everybody dies
Why can’t people live in peace? We could all enjoy our lives
Why do people need the power just to feel like they’re above?
Why we always spreading hate when we all could use the love? Yeah

Change your point of view, put yourself inside their shoes
People have been fighting all their lives just for the right to choose
How will you live? What you believe
What will you give? Freedom ain’t free
Ending a life isn’t for me
We need to heal, no longer bleed
But I ain’t judging shit, as long as you’re discussing it
Searching for some reason, do these pieces to the puzzle fit?
Know we could do more good helping the misunderstood
All the shit we feel is fucking real, this isn’t Hollywood, yeah

Everytime I promote, I find myself getting dissed
They want me to be like him, talkin bout the same thing
But all I got is enough to buy me 5 chicken wings at paradise
And a 99 cent pop at the liqour store
They say that I'm lame cause I rap about being damn poor
The hell I look like rappin bout some shit that I ain't got?
But apperently I gotta speak nonsense to be hot
And sound like that other nigga
And maybe grow some dreads
And brag about getting money and fuckin hoes in my bed
But if you walk in my room, you'll see no hoes in my bed
But you'll see a fuckin hole in the wall instead
I've hit rock bottom, and this rap shit got me depressed
I'm tired of people doubting me, makin me feel stressed
Why am I even writing this? I'm just wasting my day
Makin shit that nobody gonna listen to anyway

But if I start spittin that trash like lil pump
I bet y'all niggas would let my joints bump in the back of yo trunk, Right?
Cause everybody love to hear that ig'nant shit, right?
Damn the words, I just need to make my  beats sound hype!
I'm frustrated, all types of agitated at the game
I'm sick of hearin all these rappers rap about the same thing
But people been tellin me the same thing for a year
Yelling ''no one cares about your shitty music"" in my ear
So fuck it, Seems like I been puttin in work for nothin
I guess I'll just go head and die sellin some pills or something

Long, long way from Massachusetts

Mad at weed, cause we wouldn't think slow enough

Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Lilacs and contraband
I've got Santa Monica in my hand
A little Beatlemania when I can
I've got two big bags of old Japan, oh
Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another main event at the old rainbow
We're comin' right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

Make a deal with Uncle Weezer, sign your name to claim

Sweetness came from Jane

Warlocks in wonderland
I've gotta Rockapotomus in my hand
With a happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of lovin', is all I can

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for

I enjoy this life as a jester
Seems to keep me movin' around
Like the wind that blows
Tide that flows
Have my ups and downs
All a part of some strange plan I'm sure
Start a new chapter each day
Honey, love gets lost, time gets tossed
'Cause we've both got our own different ways

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm stranded on a sandbar
Stuck in my tracks like a street car
Playin' it for all that it's worth
I'm just payin' for my sins on earth

[Verse 2]
Now I used to go crazy for days at a time
Now I'm takin' my time with my days
Haven't found the answers like some that I know
I'm just stuck in a fairly nice maze
Climb to the top of the island tonight
Sit beneath the cashew tree
I want to count the stars, lights on the cars
That are shinin' up and down on me
[Chorus]
I feel like I'm stranded on a sandbar
Baby I'm stuck in my tracks like a street car
Playin' it for all that it's worth
I'm just payin' for my sins on earth

I feel like I'm stranded on a sandbar
Sugar I'm stuck in my tracks like a street car
Playin' it for all that it's worth
I'm just payin' for my sins on earth

263,"[Willow]
I feel the void I left behind
Am I strong enough to hold
The weight of all their souls?
I wonder if they are nearby
Shadows on the wall
Hoping we don't fall

[Venice]
Open the window feel the wind
Blow
See the city sleeping in a state
Of Limbo
I feel their presence on my
Shoulders
And in this moment
A wound is open
After all those years thought the
Lock was broken
Is the writing on the wall?
Has it been there all along?
[Venice & Willow]
It's not too late
The city is so quiet
And my midnight hour's never seen
This sight
Was our fate determined by that
Night?
Seems like -- all that's wrong could
Now be right

And from what I know this road
Is golden
And I know I believe in you
How far we've come
We've just begun
But when the morning breaks we
Will see the sun

[Emilia]
Tonight
A city sleeps
With the news on the street
That we are safe beneath
Our sheets
And so we sleep
Hoping that the bombs don't drop
On our streets
And you can feel it in the air
Expectance
Cause it was relentless
For countless seconds
The bombs would beckon
Ay yo I reckon --
This city is too quiet tonight
Time can play tricks and be so damn
Wicked
One day you're in love and your
Soul is stricken
Your heart patters fast and your
Pace is quickened
But what you don't see is the bomb
That's ticking
Well I've been married five years
My dear I swear
I thought we were a great pair
Beware, prepare
Cause these days he doesn't even
Come near
[Emilia] (Spoken)
You're late. Where were you tonight?

[Markos] (Spoken)
Didn't you hear?
My brother's got a new wife --
I said he's got a new wife and I wasn't
informed.
It's like one more thing to this goddamn
war --

[Emilia] (Spoken)
Yeah I heard, it's all over the news.
Baby come here -- don't I get a kiss
from you?

[Markos] (Spoken)
Not right now I got things on my mind.
Can't you leave me for a second -- just a
moment to unwind?
Damn -- I just need some time.
The minute I get home I gotta hear you
whine.

[Emilia] (Spoken)
Oh? Like you're so refined?
[Markos] (Spoken)
Please, baby, not now
I need you to be kind
There's a party to plan
I'm feeling hardly a man
And with all your demands
You just don't understand
I am hardly in step
With your emotional dance
From the time I walk in
I don't stand a chance

[Emilia]
All these years spent fighting
Lying
Trying not to cry

[Markos]
Give me one more reason
Not to leave and say goodbye

[Emilia]
Grasping for some memory to keep
My love alive

I need
I need a change tonight

I need a change tonight

I need a change tonight

I know
This road is
Golden (All these years)
And I know (Spent fighting)
Believe in you (Maybe this will)
What we've (Turn the tide)
Been told
We can't (I need)

You (I need a change)

On a hill that overlooked the sea
There was once a garden of beauty and of grace
Lovely as a dream could ever be

Then the roses bled and the lilies broke
On the day that death came to the garden
Hidden in the flowers, meant to break the heart
Flames that burst like blossoms in the garden

Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden

Name them all by heart, name them one by one
Countries where a child has lost tomorrow
Count the deadly flowers in the fields and woods
Count them like a rosary of sorrow
Can't you hear the voices from across the sea
Calling from the ruins of the garden
Calling out to you, calling out to me
Save us from the darkness that has fallen
On our lovely garden

Where the children played in the summer light
Running through the flowers on the hill
Laughter in their voices, hope within their hearts
Knowing they would live forever more

I have seen a child barely five or six
Counting bombs and tears, his childhood broken
Give him back the garden, give him back his life
Give him back a world where love is spoken

Let us join our voices far across the sea
Singing all together of the garden
Let the roses bloom, let the lillies grow
Let us live together for the children

7597,"#5: Charlemagne
aaaaa
The grandson of a famous general, Charles Martel (The Hammer), Charles I became the first Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire because of his military ability, his devotion to the church, and his forward thinking social policy. Both the year and place of his birth are shrouded in mystery, but his impact on history is certainly not. Charles was by all accounts a physically imposing specimen, some six feet four inches in height, with prodigious strength and manly appetites to match. These qualities made him an excellent leader from the front – he killed more enemies than most of his other soldiers – and this in turn made him a very popular commander. These qualities brought Charlemagne to dominance over most of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria as well as portions of Spain and Hungary.

Charles’s father, Pepin the Short, was invested with great rank due to the exploits of his own father, Charles Martel, who halted the advance of the Muslim horde into Europe from Spain. Pepin called on Pope Zachary to invest his son, Charles, with the royal distinction. Stephen III traveled across the Alps from Rome into modern Germany to anoint with oil Pepin (making him true king), Charles, and Pepin’s other son Carloman. This official act paved the way for Charles’s accession and assured his lifelong devotion to the Church.

After the death of Pepin, Charles and Carloman ascended jointly to the throne, each ruling half of his father’s kingdom. Charles recognized the need for expansion to protect his people from marauding barbarians and set out to complete his father’s mission of subjugating the Aquitanians. Charles was also motivated by a desire to bring order and stability to Europe as a whole, using Catholicism as his primary diplomatic weapon. This strong bond between church and military dominance was unlike any seen in Europe before or since, although it served as a model for the second Holy Roman Empire.

Carloman, on the other hand, died of illness after just three years of rule. Charles was left with the entire kingdom, proclaimed as leader of all the Franks by popular outcry. By that time, there was another new pope in place, Hadrian, who saw the advantage Charles’s strong commitment to faith could give. After entreaties from the pontiff, Charles proceeded to wage war with the Lombards. Pepin had also attacked the Lombards, ostensibly to liberate the church’s land and property from them. Pepin took some hostages and went home happy. Charles, on the other hand, laid siege to the Lombards’ important cities and banished all their rulers. Shortly, he was the ruler of Italy.

After subjugating Italy, Charles turned his attention to the German tribe of the Saxons. These Saxons were frequent marauders and raiders of Frankish lands, and Charles wasn’t going to stand for it any more. All accounts are that the Franks generally won these engagements and frequently received heartfelt capitulations from the Saxons, only for the raids to start again. Beginning in 772, Charles killed at least two Saxon leaders and converted two others at the sword, but the Saxons did not submit entirely until 804. During the vast majority of that time, Charlemagne was the acknowledged liege of Saxony. These constant struggles over a 30-year period didn’t stop Charles from expanding in other directions, though.

Charles’s next campaign brought him into Spain. His father Pepin had already brought the Gascons under Frankish rule (769), so Charles had a suitable area to launch a campaign from. In 778, he took Pamplona and drove as far as Roncesvalles, driving Muslims and Basques from their territory. By 795 he had grown all the way to Tortosa, about 50 land miles further down the coast from Barcelona.

From this point, Charles proceeded to subdue every major tribe of Germany, Demark, and the surrounding regions. His most vicious battles were fought with the Huns, who were still much-feared warriors at the time. Charles’s success on fields of battle was so monotonously consistent that by 1796, tribes were committing to him and converting to Christianity before he devised plans of conquering them.

In 800, Charles was in Rome during the modern holiday season. The Romans had removed the pope’s eyes and tongue, and the pontiff appealed to Charles for relief. Charles, of course, drove the Romans out of the church’s territory and executed most of them. On Christmas day, the king was knelt in prayer in St. Peter’s Basilica when Pope Leo III stole up behind him and placed a magnificent golden crown on his brow. From that point forward, Charles was known as the Holy Roman Emperor, Augustus. Popular legend holds that Charles had no advance knowledge of the coronation, but most serious historians think it implausible at best the Leo could have acted without the King’s express consent.

By 804, Charles had finished campaigning. He had doubled the size of his father’s already large country and was ready to devote himself to making it better. Truly the first Renaissance man, Charles had some very modern ideas for his government. The chronique.com passage below states it as succinctly as possible:

“Charlemagne struggled to protect a free peasantry against spreading serfdom… The King’s own estates… were the chief source of the royal revenue. For the care of these lands he issued a Capitulare de villis astonishingly detailed, and revealing his careful scrutiny of all state income and expense. Forests, wastelands, highways, ports, and all mineral subsoil resources were the property of the state.  Every encouragement was given to such commerce as survived; the fairs were protected, weights and measures and prices were regulated, tolls were moderated, speculation in futures was checked, roads and bridges were built or repaired, a great span was thrown across the Rhine at Mainz, waterways were kept open, and a canal was planned to connect the Rhine and the Danube, and thereby the North with the Black Sea. A stable currency was maintained... He established a system of poor relief, taxed the nobles and the clergy to pay its costs, and then made mendicancy a crime.”
Charles established free Catholic schools for the public and incited the church to make the people literate. He also held gatherings of landowners, appointed citizens to important jobs on a rotating basis, and traveled to the various parts of his domain to hear petitioners. He had many wives, making a mockery of the marital ideals of the church he championed. Eight of his children were recognized as legitimate. Toward the end of his life, Charles began to waste away. Still the Emperor continued to hunt every autumn. In January of 814, though, Charles took ill and died. The final act of Charlemagne to be witnessed was receiving the Holy Communion. His tomb was inscribed “In this tomb lies the body of Charles, the Great and Orthodox Emperor, who gloriously extended the kingdom of the Franks, and reigned prosperously for forty-seven years. He died at the age of seventy, in the year of our Lord 814, the 7th Indiction, on the 28th day of January.” It was only upon his death that he received the appellation Charlemagne, meaning of course “Charles the Great.”

Like so many great conquerors, Charlemagne’s empire did not long survive him. Lacking a sufficient personality to take the throne of such a vast territory, the realm was eventually divided into three between his grandsons. His shadow was long, though. The second Holy Roman Emperor was created in the image of the first, encompassing about two-thirds of the land mass. We still use many elements of government that he pioneered. Statuary, art and poetry from and of the time have come down through the ages, and the Song of Roland is the official epic poem of France. It was from Charlemagne that Henry VIII inherited the title “Defender of the Faith.” It was because of Charlemagne that the Catholic Church was able to dominate Europe so thoroughly and for so long. Commonly called the greatest medieval king, Charles definitely merits the title."

Dear Sam,
You may remember me— I don’t know. I met you at that party in Huntington last August. I was the squat individual with the red crewcut who was doing the imitation of Winston Churchill. Anyway, you expressed interest in this school I go to and asked me to get in touch with you. So, here I am.
Hamster High is located on a rock about a half mile off the South Shore, and not a very big rock at that, as anybody can tell you who’s been there at high tide. Nobody seems to know why they call the place Hamster High, other than the highly debatable rumor that its founder, J. Fattington Woodgrouse, had a strong liking for the fuddy little creatures. There is a statue of J. Fattington Woodgrouse in front of the school. He is a little bald-headed man with a pot belly, and he looks like a cross between the last Martian and a hungry barracuda. Last Hallowe’en someone wrote on this statue a very nasty word in bright orange paint. There was a big scandal. I was suspended for four weeks.
Maybe the fact that we’re fairly well isolated accounts for why Hamster High is— well, not exactly crazy, but— slightly odd. Take for example our trig teacher, Mr. Faggiaducci. He’s a quiet respectable young man who wears thick glasses with chartreuse rims. He also wears peg pants, satin shirt, cool cardigan, and bop beret. He tears around in a long, baby-blue hotrod sedan, and he’s always telling be-bop jokes in class. There’s nothing actually wrong with him, it’s just that he used to be a bop drummer, and now he wishes he were back with the boys at Birdland and Eddie Condon’s. He talks to himself a lot and I’ve heard rumors he takes heroin. A real “gone guy.”
Then of course there’s our principal, Mr. Sowfurkle. This boy also has music leanings— he plays the bagpipes. The bad thing about it is that he uses school hours to practice. He’s very devoted to the bloody instrument. He locks himself in his office for about an hour every day to play it. Somehow one gets the idea he doesn’t like interruptions. He was born in the hills of Tennessee, and he still carries a shotgun with him, a nasty thing with a sawed-off barrel. Anyway, one day the chemistry teacher somehow wandered into his inner sanctum and started banging on the door, and old Furk got real excited. Poor Miss Phipps. We had to get a new door, too.
You might think we’re pretty limited as far as sports go, being out on a rock like we are, but that isn’t so. Of course, we can’t have our own football or baseball fields, so we use the ones in the nearest town, Riverhampton. I feel sorry for Coach Willis. He turned down a chance to coach Football at one of the Big Ten colleges and came to Hamster High instead. Coach Willis drinks a lot.
He smokes like a fiend, too, so that the Alumni Association is screaming to fire him for setting a bad example for the boys. Coach Willis claims that it’s the teams that have driven him to drink. He says: “What can you do with a football team that consistently runs the wrong way, a basketball team which refuses to dribble the ball, and a track team which is afraid to high jump, and throws the shot-put underhand?” In a way, I think he’s right, about football at least. In the past three years we’ve lost every game except one, and that was a tie with some grade school. The only reason we were able to tie them was because the grade school team was continually being penalized for unnecessary roughness.
But still the crowds come out and cheer for our boys, so colorful and manly-looking in their brown fur football uniforms, and they cheer our loyal little team mascot, Talleyrand the Hamster. We keep Tallyrand muzzled and on a long leash, for he is a vicious little monster. This hamster has razor sharp fangs which must be at least an inch long. If you don’t believe me, I can show you the scars where Tallyrand autographed my wrist.
But now I must say so long because I am getting tired, and I have a lot of trig homework to do. Not that it has to be done for tomorrow, as chances are Mr. Faggiaducci won’t be there; he’s out on another binge. Remind me sometime to tell you about the time the State Education Inspector came to Hamster High. Poor fellow— he’s in an institution now. And remember me to Beer-belly MacPherson and the rest of the mob.
Your drunken amigo,
Boscoe Stein.

Purple and Gold, 18 December 1952, 3. “Voice of the Hamster.”

Dear Sam,
In your last letter you mentioned that you wanted to hear about the time the State Education Inspector came to Hamster High. Well, it was sort of ironic since the grandfather, J. Fattington Woodgrouse, founded our school. This guy was little and fat, like the original, and he wore a stupid-looking pork-pie hat. Mr. Sowfurkle greeted him warmly and proceeded to take him on a tour of the school.
It seems the first class he went to was Miss Phipps’ chemistry class. I don’t take chemistry myself, but I got this straight from Sid Scully, who is at present engaged in an exhaustive study of the physiological effects of complex nicotine compounds upon the human body. He is also a chain smoker. Anyway, Crazy Harrigan was doing some work in the lab with unstable plutonium isotopes. You remember Crazy— the guy who blew up the Farmingdale Bank. Just as Mr. Woodgrouse opened the lab door, out tore Crazy, yelling at the top of his lungs, and he cannonballed into the inspector. It’s a good thing he knocked the inspector down because a minute later there was a terrific explosion from inside the lab, and half the wall came down on him. Crazy had got away down the hall, and it seemed that Mr. Woodgrouse was the only casualty. He took him down to the infirmary and patched him up.
Then all through the day, little accidents kept happening to him. It’s fantastic, but it always happens when somebody we don’t want comes wandering around. He saw more of the infirmary than anything else. First, in Mr. McGinty’s physics class, a ten-pound weight rolled off the desk and hit him on the foot. Then in the cafeteria someone bumped him and knocked his meal all over his new Brooks Brothers suit, ruining it quite permanently. Around the first period he mistook the door to the dumbwaiter shaft for the men’s room and took a quick trip from the third floor to the cellar the hard way. He was in pretty bad shape when we found him, so we took him down to the infirmary. Then he wandered into Mr. Faggiaducci’s class while Mr. Faggiaducci was giving us an exhibition of bop drumming. Mr. Faggiaducci’s hand slipped. The inspector looked awful funny with that drumstick halfway down his throat. After that, he wandered out onto the archery course, which was a mistake in the first place, since we had loudspeakers warning people that Crazy Harrigan’s archery team was practicing. I pity the U. S. Army when those guys get drafted. Let Crazy even see any kind of a lethal weapon and he goes “nuts.” I guess that Mr. Woodgrouse couldn’t hear the warnings through the bandages on his head. A rescue party arrived just in time to see him being pursued by a band of madmen, an arrow through his pork-pie hat and another in his shoulder. We took him down to the infirmary again.
He would have left then, but Coach Willis wanted him to watch football practice. Everything went O.K. until Coach Willis caught wind of the fact that Mr. Woodgrouse had played collegiate football. Before the poor inspector knew what was happening, he was in the quarterback position, the ball had been snapped, and he was watching eleven stalwart specimens of American manhood charging at him with blood in their eyes. I think he had one last fleeting moment of sanity before they hit him, and then he went down beneath a mountain of brown fur football uniforms. And to top it all, Talleyrand the Hamster got loose and bit him. We dragged him down again to the infirmary and fixed up the wound— which required two stiches— and the other injuries he had acquired. I think there was also a couple of vertebrae misplaced.
He went away quite peacefully with the men in the white coats; they didn’t even need a straitjacket for him. He was talking happily to himself and laughing. He was singing a little song, too: “First the wall fell, then all the arrows, then the mob in the hamster skins, then that (here he said a very uncouth word) bit me but I don’t care. They set off an atom bomb on me, they dropped things on my feet, they rammed things down my throat, but I’m stilI happy. They set booby traps on me but I don’t care anymore hahahahaha!”
Poor guy. Every week Mr. Faggiaducci goes over to see him and cheers him up with a drum rendition. Sometimes I think that Mr. Faggiaducci is— but never mind. They say that Mr. Woodgrouse will be out in another month. He was a good guy really. One sad note: somehow he lost that cute little pork-pie hat.
Well, I guess that’s all for this time. Tell me how it’s doing at O.B. H. S., will you?
Be seeing you,
Roscoe Stein.
Purple and Gold, 22 January 1953, 2, 4. “Voice of the Hamster.”

Dear Sam,
Sorry I haven’t written sooner, but I’m in the midst of recovering from a party I attended New Year’s Eve. It was what can only be called a riot, and that’s about what it ended up as. The party was thrown by Sid Scully’s sister Marge, and there must have been over a hundred people there. Everything was quiet until Crazy Harrigan, with some mob from Queens, started a conga line sometime around 1:30 in the morning, and that was about all it took to start an argument. Marge objected to the noise, and Sid agreed with her. Sid got pretty mad and started shoving Crazy around, Crazy threw a punch at Sid, Sid threw one back, Crazy hit Sid over the head with the punch bowl, and pandemonium broke loose— before we knew it we had a full scale free-for-all on our hands. Marge was crying, Sid was sitting on the floor clutching his head and swearing a blue streak, and their St. Bernard, O’Malley by name, was gaily romping through the whole mess and wrecking chairs, lamps— anything that happened to be in the way. The men from Queens, evidently suffering from delusions that they were musketeers or some thing, were happily dueling [sic] with the curtain rods, with Mr. Scully’s imported Oriental drapes as cloaks. Crazy Harrigan was dashing around with a chair like a lion tamer, screaming some nonsense about how he was a jolly good fellow and if anyone denied it Crazy would bash his head in. About that time the men in blue arrived, and we started to calm down a bit— all, that is, except Moe Klonk, who climbed up on a chair and started yelling about how that was capitalistic oppression and bourgeois tyranny, etc. Finally he got acquainted with the business end of a nightstick the hard way, and that sort of put an end to the party. Sid had to have two stitches taken and there were a lot of split lips and bloody noses, and Marge was almost in hysterics. Happy New Year!
In your last letter you said you wanted to know more about Mr. Rafael Faggiaducci, who teaches “trig” at Hamster High. For Christmas our “trig” class gave Mr. Faggiaducci a necktie with an inscription that lights up in the dark. The first day after Christmas vacation, Mr. Faggiaducci came into class with a large red mark across his face, but he refused to tell us what had happened. We also gave him a gold-plated drumstick inscribed “To Coolcat Faggiaducci from the Boys.”
The “Boys” (note well the capital B) are a peculiar and very select group. They occupy the rear seats. Officially they are there to learn trigonometry. Actually they are engaged, under the leadership of Crazy Harrigan and Big Bob Woods, in a fascinating experiment in psychology entailing the instilling of paranoid hallucinations into the logical mind by psychoanalytic deletion of the super-ego. In other words, we are trying to see how much Faggiaducci can take before he flips his lid.
And you may be sure we are succeeding, although Faggiaducci does not exactly appreciate this. Already, he screams, his psychologist says he is getting delusions of persecution; that is, he is imagining that there is a conspiracy against him. You know the funny thing about it? There is!
For one thing, Faggiaducci hates the song “High Noon”— he goes “nuts” every time he hears it. So, John Trodsky brings his guitar to class, and we all sing, “Do not forsake me, Faggiaducci,” etc. He gets very, very peeved sometimes. I can show you a scar where I was hit by a compass Faggiaducci threw in a blind fit of rage. We also have the habit of laughing unexpectedly. It may be during a test, when the whole room is quiet— all of a sudden there is a huge roar from the back of the room. Every time Faggiaducci jumps as if he had sat on a mousetrap. Sometimes that happens too. We also pulled a real cool bit a few weeks ago. At a prearranged signal, the whole class started rocking from side to side. Faggiaducci said, “Stop that rocking!” and Sid Scully laughed and said, “What rocking?” Faggiaducci got mad and called the principal, Mr. Sowfurkle, and said, “My class is rocking back and forth. Come up and do something about it.” So, the inevitable happened; when Furk came into the room, we stopped rocking and sat perfectly still. The conversation which followed between Faggiaducci and the principal I leave to your own imagination.
Well, Sam, I guess that’s about all for now. Write soon and tell me if you have any teachers like Faggiaducci at Oyster Bay High.
As always,
Bose.

Purple and Gold, 19 February 1953, 8. “Voice of the Hamster.”

Dear Sam,
Did it! Passed trig! I was taking it half-year, you know, with The Boys, and we finally succeeded in getting Faggiaducci to the point where he was completely fed up with us. He got so mad that the day of the Regents he refused to proctor the exam. So we were stuck with some neurotic Czech who screamed instead of talked.
Anyway, we started singing, “Do not forsake me, Faggiaducci,” and he got purple and screamed— screamed, mind you, not yelled like Faggiaducci— “Shut up or I’ll kick you all out!” Then he started swearing and insulting us and throwing things until finally he got us pretty riled. Now you know there’s one thing meaner than The Boys, and that’s The Boys riled. Sid Scully called the Czech something very uncomplimentary; Crazy Harrigan hit him from behind with a ruler; and Bob Woods tripped him with a chair when he swung at Sid. He headed out of the room, intending to call the principal. That did it! En masse, The Boys arose, surrounded the Czech, picked him up bodily, stuffed him in the dumbwaiter, and left him there until we could finish the exam in peace.
Faggiaducci had said that the best mark he had expected was somewhere in the low 60’s; as it was, there was no mark lower than 92. (Don’t ask me how we did it!) This, of course, had a severe psychological effect on Faggiaducci. He hasn’t been to school in a week. I hear he had a breakdown. The Czech? Well, nobody uses that dumbwaiter shaft anymore, and so we decided to leave him there. They may find him some day— I don’t care much— he gets fed twice a week.

Dead education censored me for affection

I have nothing to confess

No solution
Your graduation

A dead end waits for us

You can say that you are alive
But too afraid, so just smile
I’m little snake in your pants
You have been here all the time but never stood up

Hide behind your lies
Wait till that turns into gold
I’m little snake in your pants
You have been here all the time but never stood up"

Rollin up for my homies
The ones that are dead and gone
This song you about to hear
This one’s for y’all
Staring down in the casket
Couldn’t shed a tear
Even though you gone (live on)
You’re still here
Thinking about them memories
Wonderin’ about that drama
Wonderin’ if the Lord
Is handing us our karma
They say it was all written
Words lead to a comma
But every word we spoke
Was definitely by the comma
Rollin up for my homies
Who wanna make it out
Writing all my homies
Gotta bail em out
Rolling up for my homies
All dead and gone
Rollin up for my homies
I dedicate this song

[Verse 2: Chinx]
As I sit here roll up
I think about my niggas sometimes
Why you left me so soon
I feel like I owe us some time
Sipping Yack, rolling killa
I might roll up on a b*tch
I just bought a new foreign
Just to roll up on your strip
As I scroll through my mental Rolodex
Pictures us rollin
You had my back, I had your’s
And they know the bleakers was loaded
Now the bases is loaded
Gonna take this sh*t out of the park
You ain’t with me to see it
At times I feel so defeated
We came up as some youngins
Done with half on them onions
Coulda been hit the prison
Cuz we was trafficking numbers
Now my show’s packed out in London
Pockets wrapped up with hundreds
Swear to God I be trippin’
Cuz I miss my nigga Bundles

Call him ""Sweet Man"" Sam

And with my best friend Nan

'Bout my man, understand
Lost my head, wish I'se dead

Hope he comes back 'fore it all gеts out

Kick off your shoes
Put your feet in the dash

Just you and me we got no plans
No rush, no being late
Past a million trees, the rolling hills
The mountains with the snow
But after all I've seen and where I've
Been there's onе thing that I know

And for the wifies who do - shout out to you boo!
You made the right choice, and happiness looks good on you!

Give it up for them BB-dubs, looking luscious and feminine
Pixie cuts, playing double dutch
To the shorties in the Chucks rocking afro puffs
Baddies with the bundles and the 26-inch weave
With Supreme Metrocard or dangling keys to the V's
And my nails so long, asking how I operate?
You should probably book me now before my prices inflate

Let’s keep it in the daylight
Fall in love again
Heart out in the headlights

Feeling vein inside
Enough to start a fight
A test of metal or
A feather in full flight

One wound for another
Spreading scars like sickness in the air
Tethered and torn by the pain we wear
I don’t want to wake up
No I don’t want to let you down
It’s looking like a warning sign
Every time the morning comes

In my stead I wait
Thursday night was just a game
You can call again
I’ve got ammo to defend
Was it fear or faith?
When all this did begin
It’s all over now

It's just that I've got
Nothing better to do

But you won't listen anyway

Now you've escaped my thoughts
Can't say I have envy or any remorse
But now that you've gone away
That's really no price to pay

You sit in bars drinking
For much of your spare time
I don't know what you'll be drinking
But it won't be no lemon-and-lime
You keep on drinking
And wasting your nights away
And I'm sat here thinking
That I'm glad that you didn't stay

But you won't be listening anyway

Now you've escaped my thoughts
Can't say I have envy or any remorse
But now that you've gone away
That's really no price to pay

And how these lil' rappers taking all these drugs, uh
All these rappers getting famous man they lucked up
I'm about to hit they faces with a nunchuck

Yo it's been about a year, it's long overdue
Me and homie been about it, this here is volume 2

I'm feeling brand new when I'm hoppin out the coupe
This is volume 2, I'm hitting like I'm Rae Carruth

I just stay up at the crib, I got everything I need
Laying verses, making beats, when I'm hungry, wifey feeds
Not a worry in the world, I dare you bitches come and see
Got some shells y'all could swallow, I ain't talking bout them seeds

Made away from the trenches & the bad thoughts
Fuck around with Green Day, we getting black-balled
Their fucking fans dick ride, they like to grab balls
Now I'm lookin to my future with my mask off
They thought that we were playing, took some time off
All these weirdos in the game getting signed off
We never lost, get up off it, know it kills to see
Us reunited, uninvited making history

This is psycho-analysis, got my vice and my catalyst
In the river I'm paddling, if you spitting, let's battle then
I don't fuck with them severed ties, all you bitches is Federline
So think of some better lines, I'm just spitting with Gemini

DT hit up my line, he said ""I got that new ride, I'll be there around five""
He said, ""it's time to get live""
Then he pulled up outside, I wasn't even surprised
Took a 3 hour drive so we could lay down these lines

Look I just speak with a Semi, I'm going ether like Pesci
Until the reaper come get me, I'm on the streets with my dezi
I hope these people accept me before I'm seen as a memory
And all these seats are just empty and then the preacher forgets me

We had some losses last year that really brought back my fears
What if they never shed tears for all the time I was here
What if they don't crack a beer and we just disappear
What if the time passes by and they never hear ""What You Hear"""
3654,"1 For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

2 Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.

3 Once again I testify to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obliged to obey the entire law.

4 You who want to be justified by the law have cut yourselves off from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.

5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.

6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything; the only thing that counts is faith working through love.

7 You were running well; who prevented you from obeying the truth?

8 Such persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.

9 A little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough.

10 I am confident about you in the Lord that you will not think otherwise. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.

11 But my friends, why am I still being persecuted if I am still preaching circumcision? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
12 I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!

13 For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence, but through love become slaves to one another.

14 For the whole law is summed up in a single commandment, ""You shall love your neighbor as yourself.""

15 If, however, you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.

16 Live by the Spirit, I say, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.

17 For what the flesh desires is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit desires is opposed to the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, to prevent you from doing what you want.

18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not subject to the law.

19 Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness,

20 idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions,

21 envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these. I am warning you, as I warned you before: those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

22 By contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,

23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.

24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.

26 Let us not become conceited, competing against one another, envying one another."

You're even better now you're gone

6312,"Your Smile
Will always be one of my favorite things
Like backyard Barbeques and front porch swings, an evenin breeze through a window screen
Your smile
Makes me feel just like a child inside
Like christmas morning sparkling red and bright, grandads pipe, my first bike
Your Smile

Like sunlight dripping through the trees
Like a wheat field whispering in the breeze
Like a sweet sweet melody that sets me free

Your Smile
So much joy from such a simple thing
Like an old wheel barrow filled with summer rain, soft warm cake, and a blue skied day
Your smile

Your Smile
Like sunlight dripping through the trees
Like a wheat field whispering in the breeze
Like a sweet sweet melody that sets me free
Your Smile
Right there with buttered beets, cherry pie
And all the other simple joys of life that warm my heart, make it all worth while
Your Smile"

I was in the dark too long
The woman that I loved now gone
And she took a piece of me
Yeah she took a piece of me

Missing piece, missing piece
Tryna find out who gon be the rest of me
Tryna find out who gon fill the recipe
I won't let these thoughts get the fuckin' best of me
As the day goes by I look at my life
Will it be alright
Will it be alright, alright
I been thinkin' all night
With the liquor in my hand
Will I ever be the man
I just know it's worth a damn try
It's all I ever wanted
Never had me shit to flaunt it
Ever since I first began
It's been always in the plan
Imma do it 'til I can't write
'Til the day that I can say it like
Bitch I been the one ever since a jit
Suicidal doors, I just slit they wrist
Random groupie whores ain't got shit on my bitch
I just up the score, every shot of mine swish
Could've never made it here without a team tho
Started from the bedroom with a dream hoe
Now we the life of every single function
Bitch I'm what they couldn't be
They mad cause they ain't ruin me
Ain't a soul alive that be fuckin' with me truthfully
If them fuckers wanna try, they better bring themselves a ulegy
If I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Middle fingers up to remind ya
She could hit me up, I ain't sayin' a word
Park the Bently truck on the side of the curb
I ain't signin' shit unless they know what I'm worth
And that's a steep price
I am nothing like the shit you've seen right
Cause I'm way too on
Space boof blunt got me way too gone
I done came in with a drip too strong
And you know me
Don't need an OG
Keep the fake hoes from around me
I'm the big dog in my county
And that's nothing but facts, I put on my life
She bring me that ass, it make me feel right
She throw it throw it back for a real motherfucker
Way she do that there, god damn I think I love her

Feels like we never learn, and it's confirmed when burning chronic
A promise of honest frauds with dogs returning to their vomit
I don't wanna applause, I want a cause that we can die for
Swore goodbye to lies, asked why do we even try for?
Why you're surprise, disguise comprised the makeshift
Then shape-shifts its traits til you can't place where the face is
Taste this disgrace that was laced with the feeling of dealing with nothing real
This reveals the chameleon
Concealing in dirt dealing that was stealing our reality
A smile to hide the hurt, to search for comfort in the fallacy
Work the balance beam a challenge seems to be the teetering
King of the pull trip so the bullshit keeps on deepening
Seek to bring the clarity but parody my polarity
I'm variably depressed so yes distress my favorite charity
I'm like a parakeet to keep repeating a need for speaking
I'm seeking a fleeting sentiment benefit of tentative teachings
I'm reaching for eminent evidence, a glimpse of heavenly resonance
While pestilence in my shell rung like a bell that hell's my residence
It's prevalent as well ain't hard to tell ain't nothing good enough
Enough stuff in my brain it's so much pain I wish it would erupt
I should've struck to fuck the proud and pretentious
Dwellers of wells without water more of a cloud in a tempest
I'm empath to the slaughter seeking order in calamity
Insanity at our borders filling coffers with our casualties
[Tabs]

I hear the people talking as I'm sleep walking through Neverland
I never listen, mood forever shifting like a desert sand
Trying to be a better man, can't ignore what we got
But that last pedal landed on the floor she loves me not
And, what I thought to be a pillar of stone became a
Cold shoulder that left me chill to the bone and now I
Rome the wilderness feeling alone
Subjected to these wretched thoughts that are filling my dome
I thought this was a treasure but what I found
Was no pearl and it turned my whole world upside down
And now, Hell is redemption and Heaven is painful
And that devil on my shoulder is disguised as a benevolent angel
A malevolent fable, not able to stay sane, cuz the
Truth has been sent to the losing end of the blame game
Forever in trouble how am I supposed to maintain
When that light at the end of the tunnel is a freight train
I felt a great pain ever since I was knee high
Cuz these eyes watched as opportunities would speed by
I don't know what to do, my moment of truth was a complete lie
Watch my dream die and couldn't even muster up a reply
I just hit the ground running, I couldn't hold still
I knew that the view from the top would be so ill
But when I got to the top my soul felt the cold chill
Cuz I found out this mountain is only a mole hill
[Chorus - Tabs]
Now I realized all of this time was time wasted
Mouth full of sand to understand how lies tasted
The pain is strong how long can I take this
Mouth full of sand to understand how lies tasted
This lie fate is irate cuz I hate this
Mouth full of sand to understand how lies tasted
I could be great but I'll probably die nameless
Mouth full of sand to understand how lies tasted

I wanna wake and break from this confusion
I know it's fake I'm tasting the illusion
There is no escape from the fate that you're choosing
I'm loosing faith to wait for my solution

Wanna break through the wall
Of the lies of it all
From the fake and the false"

She’s in the back of a black Honda Accord
Getting faded off the Jane ain’t no destination in store
Staring at a sky she’s seen a million times before
But something in her eyes made the world seem so much more
Than reality
Cruising, losing touch with gravity
Plotting how to leave her hometown, passing strategy
She hopes to one day visit each star in the galaxy
Shoes on new leather to add to her photo gallery
The front yelling, “fuck you”
“Bitch I’d bet you’d love to”
She pretty through the city show her titties  through the sun-roof
Finally back at where she stay
Told the party come through
Next morning she wake up, see her face on channel 1 news
Shit happens, that’s just life
She turns off the TV and rolls something to light
No matter what happens everything gon’ be alright
Because good stories always come from bad nights
[Chorus - Kelsey Chu]
Where do we go?
Fuck what they told us
Break-in the road
Lord only knows what
Lies behind her eyes
So what she doing out here?
Pride is her disguise
But she know’s her fear

[Verse 2 - Gavin Rizzo]
Durning the day she’s 9-5 working
Her mother want’s a nurse but Jane is uncertain
Her co-workers only ever see what’s on the surface
But she gets off her shift and doesn’t need a purpose
Feeling lit, feeling like
2am, summer night
City strip, running lights
She do what the fuck she like
Windows down, living life
Looking out, past the sky
Wondering what’s out of sight
Wonder where to take the night
Pitch black, backseat getting smacked as fuck
80 on the backroads, hit the gas and passed the blunt
Her mother was imperious like Battle Star Galactica
And If she knew the half of what she’s done she’d probably slap the fuck-
Outa her angel daughter
Too bad she’s sound asleep having dreams of a doctor
While Jane is on the creep in the shoes she bought her
Sneaking back in with a plot for tomorrow
[Chorus - Kelsey Chu]
Where do we go?
Fuck what they told us
Break-in the road
Lord only knows what
Lies behind her eyes
So what she doing out here?
Pride is her disguise

Pay the man his wage, he's making paper
To fuel the ""Information Age""
Out in the midwest
Hear the roar of the plough
Turning grassland into sand
Got to feed the people more every day
But the wind keeps blowing the land away
Give and take
Has all we've learned been wrong?
Look around at what we've been given
Maybe we've taken too long

Resistance- shouts the man on the right
Can't solve the problem overnight
Resistance- Liberal opposition crying violation
Stop the madness
Resistance- Through the din, one voice we should hear
Resistance- Listen to the call of the wild

There's no easy solution
The price is high, and it's time to pay
Turn of the century vision
Focused on a better way
Resistance- shouts the man on the right
Can't solve the problem overnight

Resistance- Liberal opposition crying violation
Stop the madness
Resistance- Through the din, one voice we should hear
Resistance- Listen to the call of the wild"

There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile
He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile
He bought a crooked cat
Which caught a crooked mouse
And they all lived together in the little crooked house
There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile
He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile
He bought a crooked cat
Which caught a crooked mouse
And they all lived together in the little crooked house"

When the last go first and the first go last

When you won the fight but you lost the war
When you stand your ground even though you’re wrong

When you're lost in the moment
You can't see where you're goin'
I didn’t know who I could trust
So I put all my faith in us
Oh, you tore me to pieces
Turned my strength into weakness
I didn't want it all to fall apart
So I decided just to play the part

But honestly, I'd do it all again
Puttin' up with all the bullshit
It made me strong enough to do this

Weighing down on me
I lost my sanity
And now that we are through, nothin' left to lose
No, no, no, I don't think about you

I feel freedom where I stand now
And I feel proud of who I am now
Yeah, I learned a lot along the way
I love the woman that I became

I was patient, but not anymore
It's back in my hands
And you swore I'd never do it
But it's your time to face the music

After all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove

6402,"[Letra de ""Hercules""]

[Verso 1]
It's worthless, this fighting
It takes me nowhere
This darkness, it's blinding
I'm full of despair
My hope is lost, my soul was torn
And slammed to the ground
I'm left with all these shattered dreams
So much pain, it kills me
It's harder to breath
No complaints, I just thought
It would be forgot
You broke my heart, you ran away
And left me for dead
You lead me to this dead-end street

[Refrão]
But nothing can stop me
From finding my way back home
I have faith in my fate
I struggle every single day through this blind world
[Verso 2]
Nobody sees the truth that lies next to them
Deny it, forget it
Do you understand, that what you take for granted just might go away?
Your whole world might turn into grey
It's too late for me now
I can't turn around
My path goes on and on
Now, my change is gone
And when I see your face
It tells me to embrace the pain

[Refrão]
But nothing can stop me
From finding my way back home
I have faith in my fate
I struggle every single day through this blind world

[Bridge]
We walk through a blind world
Where fog won't let us see

[Refrão]
But nothing can stop me
From finding my way back home
I have faith (I have faith)
In my fate (In my fate)
I struggle every single day
I swear that I won't give up
I struggle every single day through this blind world
Through this blind world"

Kill me now, kill me now
I can't do this anymore
Kill me now, kill me now

Let me break, let me break
I wanna go away
Don't let me stay
Kill me now, kill me now
I don't wanna do this anymore
Kill me now, kill me now
I don't wanna go to the next life
Let me break, let me break
I wanna go away
Don't let me stay

Fast-pace, no, we're going slow-paced
It ain't a fucking race, make no mistake
I don't wanna stay here any morе than you do
Just drunk on my depression, can't help but drink
I'm so tirеd I can't even think, can't even blink
Vision so blurry, I can't help but sink
Drowning in the black ocean, sink
I'm a femboy so turn it pink
Let me shrink, I'm on the brink of losing it
Don't try to find me if I go missing
My soul's flame is sizzling until it dies
Until then, I'll continue the rhyme
I just wanna die and move on...
Yeah...
[Verse II]
I can't look at myself
It doesn't feel the same without you
Depression can't be cured off a bookshelf
Much less by yourself with the phone you got left
Dekstop on the desk, your soul hanging, meaningless
Faking my happiness, emotionless, empty and hollow
Feeling alone, I ain't one for friends, remaining silent
I'm never so fucking violent, going at fights like Ultra Instinct
Yeah"

Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very mad world mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me
And I find it kinda funny
I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying

Beautiful are the rivers,

Beautiful are the flowers,

Beautiful is the first ray of sunrise,
that makes us feel healthy and wise.
Beautiful is that bond of friendship,

Switching up the techniques when I'm stabbing it

And represent the nigga that's scoring slamin' the ding-a-ling
And tell her friends to keep hatin'

Did you get it (it is over)
My written's so legit I wanna get a poster
She said I was correct but I regret I told her
Cause my flow is running better with a second motor
And keep it going like I'm up drinking hella foulders

Propelling the generation with them iller bangers

And when the whole world's glided
Through our hands misguided
An ordeal by fire, a dance on a wire without end

But like the water on the levee the years are damned inside my head
Sometimes the devil tells me I’d be better off dead
Oh Living just gets harder death is such a lousy deal
I’ll take a few more turns on the big steam wheel

[Verse 3]
Its mostly quiet on the water it helps a restless mind to think
That’s what keeps me going that’s why I stay with her til she sinks
But tonight the city echoes with celebrations on the street
The soldiers have returned and victory’s their marching beat
I guess i’ll never know that feeling of returning home at last
I’ll never have a crowd rejoicing  or roses lining up my path
I’ll just live a simple life and pray before my meals
I’ll take a few more turns on the big steam wheel
[Verse 4]
It don’t take a four walled prison to make a person feel alone
For many live in chains on the wide and open roads
If an angel visits you at night you better welcome her to stay
She’ll help you treasure all that living and send your soul away
I know it won’t be long until my judgement comes
It’s on every faded moon and on every sinking sun
Death is on the hunt  like a hound dog at our heels
It’s just a few more turns on the big steam wheel"

[Verse 1]
You're physically in this, but how could we tell
If we was meant to be in bliss if you're not mentally as well?
This energy you're sending me is tricky as hell
Usually it's like a 50/50, we could take a L
Before we start things, at this point being apart brings
The feeling of somebody plucking at your heart strings
I know it probably shouldn't feel like this
But any other woman I see is in your likeness
It's from your cheekbones
To your lips, to your curves, to your deep moans
To that walk, to your words
You love feeling like a breakdown on the verge
First we on good terms, then you on my last nerves
Got my back just aching, my shoes is all tight
It's too complex when we choose to do it right
It's wrong, one minute you a soldier strong
Then you trying a route talking about it's over and gone

His name Black, and he known to be a lover of
Getting it on with my smoker's jacket on
Eyes racing back and forth listening to Chaka Khan
Trying to figure the cause why you always acting off
Like I'm slacking off
Maybe our signal's getting crossed
For the case Love, you feel like you making a waste of
Your precious time you need to get a taste of
Some space to breathe, a moment as friends
We should've felt ourselves slipping into it again
Cuz it's like off and on, on and off
Passion, lost and found, found and lost
Clashing, asking for nothing but understanding
Your hearts made of glass, use care when handling
Girl, all in all I never leave you stranded
Cuz my respect you commanded, you figure it out

I used to come into the party and stand around
Cuz I was kinda too shy to really get down
I used to play the corner and watch the scene
Deep down knowing I wanted to find me a queen
And I could feel that in my stomach and up in my chest
Because I knew a lot of women, and some was fresh
But then I found you girl, and just like me
You had a heart that was yearning to be set free
Now listen, see you and me we need to take the time
To erase any doubt that's inside your mind
It's not a mountain that I'm ever too tired to climb
And who's counting, but I know at least a thousand times
I let you know I'm here for you, care for you, and confide in you
Break bread, share with you, and provide for you
And that's full time, it's no 9 to 5 with you
That's why I'm trying to work it out with you, it's gonna work

Gettin bigger so I know that I can't lack now
Don't let kevin get you hurt cause you a funny guy
If you say it with ya chest we put you put you back down
Better not fuck up my bread if we in contact
Ima always throw the glove on like its combat
If its not a couple mil then I can't sign that
In the motion movin fast like its a time lapse
If we ever doin business need a contract
If I ever hit some new shit need a contract

Been to hell and back
I don’t know how to top that
So I go to Cali just to put the top back
I’m not married but my finger Ima rock that
If she do not want a title you should watch that
Bitches wig be stinkin I think you should wash that
Niggas hittin shit that I be shocked at
Kiss the mirror cause I'm cocky
Now they hate on me
Guess I’m doin this shit right cause I hate slavery
And I'm not poppin out if the club isn't payin me
And if they do we havin shit look like a bakery
And my shorty she sun kissed I got a hot ting
Que lo que I got papi hittas on my team
Anybody want that drama we can stop things
But I'm a champion lil homie I can’t stop rings
If she a queen then I gotta shoot the shot
Okay
I would never show the bitch the watch
Diamonds blind a bitch make it too easy dog
I don't trust a bitch if she look at the rocks
I just been too confident I'm schemin
I been coppin this designer for no reason
Use to stress about the money
Now I'm mad I always got it
Got my sliders up so they think that I'm cheatin
Just invest all of my money keep me stackin
I see niggas everyday and they move backwards
Got some movie roles for niggas if they actin
Wearing fitteds is the only time I'm cappin

Better not fuck up my bread if we in contact
Ima always throw the glove on like its combat
If its not a couple mil then I can't sign that
In the motion movin fast like its a time lapse
If we ever doin business need a contract
If I ever hit some new shit need a contract
If we ever doin business need a contract

Bitch yea yea

1460,"On a starry night, down in Virginia
I fell in love with a blue eyed girl
Her kiss was warm, her touch was tender
The sweetest one in all the world

Chorus
At night I dream about her
In my dreams, she holds me tight
And when the clouds roll in at twilight
I sit and dream of a starry night

Second Verse
Then one day down in Virginia
My blue eyed girl she went away
I miss her love, I miss her Kisses
I'll always mourn that cloudy day

Chorus

Third Verse
Now if you're goooin' to Virginia
Don't be fooled by a blue eyed girl
A starry night could leave ya dreamin'
Of the sweetest one in all the world"

[Bad Intro]
Who's bad?

[Verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

Thriller
[Verse: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough

Black or White/Remember the Time
[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
No, I believe in miracles, and a miracle has happened tonight (night, night)
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white

Scream
[Verse: Michael and Janet]
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Hoo!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!

[Pre-Chorus: Michael and Janet]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? (Make you want to scream?)
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!

[Chorus: Both]
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!

I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
""I know I am someone,"" and let the truth unfurl

Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

When you don't plan on paying it

So really not saying shit

This rap game is foul
This rap game is not even rap

How is it new if I already did it
Im the type to call Kanye and say I already hit it

Difference between us
Like commas and questions
Hennessey fever
I'm coming, I'm coming, inception

Not even time for the testing
What's your intentions
Well said, don't even listen
Words give static
Success is my fabric

Tragic

I couldn't say shit that'll make the truth easier
Fucking at the top didn't come to get features
For real
And I mean it

I just do me

Constantly on some hating shit

And fucked up your life
Man you fucked up the knowledge
I'm sorry
I'm honest
I'm feeling the Moment
Girls know me now they come like enrollment
I'm living like Romans
Partying like oh man
I get a buzz when the 808 bang
Four missed calls I don't really wanna talk
I don't really wanna hang
I don't really wanna stop
Anybody wanna step
To me you get dropped

I'm riding with the top
And a heat on the seat tho
Damn there goes another ne-gro
Damn they mad wherever we go
LeBron in the back shooting free throws
You know!

Day 1 I ain't had nobody
I had to exhume my corpse
In order to wake the force
Day 2 I ain't had no money
Thinking and planning but I forgot
That dreams cost

Day 3
Still just me
Still hungry
With a dream
That I can't eat

Sometimes all I have is envy
Walk a mile and you'll see why I'm me

Tired of digging up soil
And putting rappers to use
Come see
Ressurection man nothing to lose
Bomb strapped to my chest when I blow it's news
And when I fall from the top hope it make u amused

Taking the game down
I ain't rest since I came down
Only rapper that ain't sound
I don't even make music just to make it now
I'm tryna reach your heart but everybody fake now

Ain't it good to be King, is it everything you dreamed
Are you satisfied with life, given everything you've seen
You've  seen people die for your place or lose their mind in your race
You fell short, I see it cause the proof is all in your face
Thought you could change the world cause you found yourself
I've watched you juggle right and wrong, I've watched you doubt yourself
I've watched the downtrodden find a way without your help
I turned your heart cold and now I watch it melt
What is it about status that makes you feel invincible?
What is it about status that makes you feel loved?
What is it about status that makes you forget principle?
All of your status don't place you above all of your peers
You know that success is subjective, you don't care to respected
You just care to be requested, attention makes you feel special don't it

[Talking]
How special are you now nigga?

[Verse 2]
Oh, forgot to tell you my name's Meisei
I know I told you [?] But that was the safe way to get you close
Way back when, I was just chilling in my black box
Until somebody just like you broke the padlock
I told him he had three wishes
Then he wished for bitches, then he wished for power, then he wished for riches
And that was cool, I could grant him that
I tried to give him the key to life and watched him hand it back
He said ""I'm good with what I got, I mean I been through a lot""
I said ""go change the world"", he said ""the world never stops""
And then he left
I realized it was an exercise in futility
Human fragility, you are the enemy
[Talking]
Waiting
I know you're not trying to crawl away during my story
I'm not done
I'm not done
Stay there

[Verse 3]
So I took a walk, looking for a better heart
Then I saw you, you were all blue
12 and depressed, looking for a voice
Couldn't see no way out, you were looking for a choice weren't you?
So I gave you one
Told you could have control and that made you run
Said you wanted to change the world
Then we got there and all you wanted was chains and girls
Dammit nigga
Well I guess it went just how I planned it nigga
You became the management and couldn't manage nigga
I'm surprised you didn't overdose
Surprised you didn't crash your ride, surprised you wasn't comatose
The hearts of men ain't in a great place
Now your life ain't ending in a great way
Now you can rest forever, take a vaca'

Craving something fine
Keeping my desire now

Straight short nigga oxin niggas givin 'em doctor stitches
First chance I get, you know I'm shittin
On them fake-ass thugs, stuntin in the club
Don't get scuffed in front of these broads
Homey so pussy, what they do to they broad
Beat them bitches up if they dance to the Mobb

Hate on you lame-ass niggas, we need not

Nightmares right here live in the flesh
Our blood and bone be sittin in Ferraris and better
We out in L.A. we drive our own cars, they not renters

I'm grimy, you find me where the loot is with Lugers
The bodies, the hotties, the hustlers and the shooters
With dudes that'll cut ya, that's what eatin your food is
Fools know the rules pull out your tools better buck it
Cause niggas be flaggin and braggin when they cut up your nugget
Knee deep in the grind like ""fuck it""
We gotta keep it real son that's only how the people gon' love it
And learn to respect the Infamous to the death kid
We on another level, yeah we really on some next shit
Got the techs spittin and makin more connections
Makin more cash and blastin more weapons

Unto the throne I am summoned (and) once again I rule the sunless sky
In the kingdom of Shadows, where the blood is the life, and through
The shadowed astral gates, I enter thy kingdom to rule once more

I offer the very life from my veins, onto the altar of the Dragon
One thousand voices of a race beyond are heard
As I rise amongst the Spheres (stars)

Through the Shadowed woods of Torment
My soul aches for her touch, onto the West shores of water
I reach thy Kingdoms edge, to embrace the cold winds of the
Nocturne as I gaze into the Abyss
The Eye of TIAMAT unleashes it's freezing stare
The Dragon is awakened upon the kingdom
Denied by mortals - all hail for chaos is embraced!

Upon the shadowed kingdom of darkness
The Sun dares not to cast forth the light
All that once was hidden from the view of MALKUTH
Shall become the wisdom of the Vampir -
Who transverse thy Kingdom!
I rise through YESOD for from the blood I found life
I ascend into the glorious Moonlight
Thy Kingdom is beauty, thy Kingdom is pain
In the Chaotic bliss of the shadows

As my astral rises amongst the stars
I journey towards the mystery of the ages
To gaze upon the throne, to ascend the pathways of wisdom

I gaze into the birth of the Nigtsky
Lucifer, the Morning star gleams triumphantly

Into the Woods of Bewitchment
The furious winds carries my thoughts (on) to the realms
Our kind, which is feared but respected
Shall reign (beyond) this Kingdom of Shadows
Our blood that is of KINGU shall boil
With a hate so pure towards mankind
Chaos is one with our Kindred for TIAMAT's blood
Has spawned our shadowed souls!"
2945,"Waiting in the wings
Your courage sings before you falter . . 
It's just another way to say
What's there but never shows

It's just another day to lay
Your sins before the altar
And where it's going to end
This time around nobody knows

Every time it seems that you
Have gained an understanding
Those devils at your heels
Reach up and try to tip the scales

Waking from a dream
You see it's all been done without you
And every vain attempt to make it stay
Is destined to fail

Fury rages through your restless days
Shades of time that's gone before
Empty cages where the prisoner plays
'Til the door swings closed behind for evermore . . 
Evermore...
Evermore...
Long before we come of
Age we yearn to leave the garden
And wrestle with a myth
The hand of fate
Has faintly drawn

But somewhere on the way
We feel our hearts begin to harden
And see just as we learn
To turn around
The garden is gone

Fury rages through your restless days
Shades of time that's gone before
Empty cages where the prisoner plays
'Til the door swings closed
Behind for evermore . . 

Evermore...
Evermore..."

All I am is who you see (who you see)
All I give is what you really need (what you believe)
I'm just me, I'm just me
I'm just me, I'm just me
Yeahhhhhh
I just don't understand why these feeling take control over me
Is it just because I'm weak or is my mind all that they need
Cause when I close my eyes is when they usually try to speak
And when I awake I just grab my pen because that's how I spread my wings

Do you believe in what you see
All these words that have been spoken keep some alive
And always searchin because they believe in what they see

4445,"The treatment of children in Indian Residential Schools is a sad chapter in our history.

For more than a century, Indian Residential Schools separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities. In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate Aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools.  Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture.  These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, ""to kill the Indian in the child"".  Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country.

One hundred and thirty-two federally-supported schools were located in every province and territory, except Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.  Most schools were operated as ""joint ventures"" with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United Churches.  The Government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities.  Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed.  All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities.  First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools.  Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home.

The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian Residential Schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage and language.  While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities.

The legacy of Indian Residential Schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today.

It has taken extraordinary courage for the thousands of survivors that have come forward to speak publicly about the abuse they suffered.  It is a testament to their resilience as individuals and to the strength of their cultures.  Regrettably, many former students are not with us today and died never having received a full apology from the Government of Canada.

The government recognizes that the absence of an apology has been an impediment to healing and reconciliation.  Therefore, on behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, I stand before you, in this Chamber so central to our life as a country, to apologize to Aboriginal peoples for Canada's role in the Indian Residential Schools system.

To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the Government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we apologize for having done this.  We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this.  We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this.  We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you.  Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry.

The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long.  The burden is properly ours as a Government, and as a country.  There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again. You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey. The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.

Nous le regrettons
We are sorry

In moving towards healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy of Indian Residential Schools, implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement began on September 19, 2007. Years of work by survivors, communities, and Aboriginal organizations culminated in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to move forward together in partnership.

A cornerstone of the Settlement Agreement is the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  This Commission presents a unique opportunity to educate all Canadians on the Indian Residential Schools system.  It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us.

Tell me what to do

And I will not pretend to be
Extending a hand that holds the key
Unlocking a plan that can consider you
And you are ill prepared to fight
Living in a world of soft and white
In air-conditioned battle zones, I pity you

And from here to you, I’m seeing souls in collision
Who can they be?
With eyes in all directions, but why can't they see?
That the sight of you is starting up a war inside of me
The sight of you is building up a war inside of me
You're my kind of woman, I get rid of you"

So nothin' less than a mean mug, what I'm gon' show you

And we both females, so I hope you ain't feelin' me
Cause I got the remedy to all that sideways lookin'
Run up on you when you get your purse and sidekick ???
You look like the stupid type that be on MySpace thuggin'
This reality here bit you, get your pockets shookin'

You're choosin' ??? for that tough shit
There's space and opportunity, I got time
So if you got a reason to start shit, I got mine
It's cause you're lookin' at me crazily
Got too much damn bravery
You don't really wanna catch a fade with me
Cause your block will end up hatin' me
You're lookin' at me crazily, I'ma make you be afraid of me

You hear that high ha!, you gon' hear my shoe more rockin'
Makin' contact with your head, that won't hear you chuckin'
So before you get cut like dope, and I get to chokin' hoes
And you get some broken bones, I suggest you look away
'fore you get knocked in your dome, for steady tryna provoke
And ignorin' what you're told, pay attention when I say
It's fairly simple, you got beef or you got business with me
I ain't even on the top, damn it, it's just simple to see
You're starin' hard, and look, hear if you don't listen to me
One other tooth you gon' get lyrically or physically beat

Cause if they step in my grill I'll be leavin' with their necklace
Half the ladies and fellas what I'm talkin' 'bout

The bank be doing well and I don't even rock with fargo, Niggas move a couple grams and they swear to God that it's Narcos
Why they talk it, I walk it
I had it never lost it
It's one night get back to yo life baby girl why you stalking
The ride the wave and I'm hopping they don't car sick
Known to leave yo girl dripping running just like a faucet
Hoe I'm from the ville that's a 256 killer, but I still keep the Rocket in pocket not talking Clint Capela
I live the dream like Hakeem, I'm stacking money to ceiling feeling like Yao Ming know what I mean
And I never lost the magic but like TMac when I'm macking, if you wanna get buck I'm well protected from the Warren Sapp and
These rappers for lunch all I need is napkin, And whoever had the crown well it's time for them pass it
All I need is one shot call me the black John Paxon, I'm getting better by the bar hear me gaining traction
I grew up round' dealers and killers now raps the occupation, The way I give bars would swear to God I'm incarcerating
What's a 9-5 I'm trying to be the greatest, What's a hit when you know you trying to save a generation
But knowing you never can, knowing they'll never give you a chance
Just know that I'm the man and I'm in that killa Cam
And that mean that all pink, and you know it's authentic
And I'm all in it, you niggas know I ball like sports-center
A go getter, had the sauce but never got lost in it
A true killer keep it chiller, keep it on khwei leanord
I mean kwhai, said it for the sake of the rhyme
Killing everybody beat at a drop of a dime, yo favorite rapper too gonna hit em with a red line
I'm only getting better so that's gotta be a sign, and this for the fan even if it's 2 or 5 y'all the reason why I wake up in the morning feeling inspired
But for real, I really wish y'all knew how it feel
No matter how ill, You never guaranteed a deal
If you don't mumble in yo raps, that mean you never will appeal to the masses
Even if you got the fire with no one to match it
Now I'm stuck in college classless, trying to make a classic
Wish it would go faster, but i'm still on top just like an attic
Your son (sun) still gone shine that's how I look at it, See the fans as fens so you know I gotta serve the attics
December 8th, I had to drop the volume 2
Show you how I really do, and show how I much I improved
And I still haven't made it yet got a lot to prove, But the game drive you insane just like Bishop in the Juice
I'm wide awake chasing dreams, doing work upon the mic
Alabama summers but I swear them was the coldest nights
Staying up to 4 trying to make my beats and write my rhymes
Working on the listens, but the only thing that played was time
This for the fam, know that y'all don't hear a lot from me
But I'm working so life can be like we won the lottery
Just know I pick up every time I can and that's possibly
I put my life upon these lines and pray to god y'all proud of me

Get away (get away Jordan)
Get away (get away ole chilly Jordan)
Get away (get away Jordan)
I wanna cross over to see my Lord
Well, Get away (get away Jordan)
Get away (get away ole chilly Jordan)
Get away, old chilly Jordan (get away Jordan)
I wanna cross over to see my Lord

[Verse 1: Jake Hess]
You know, I promised the Lord if he set me free
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
I’d go until I find what the end might be
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
One day, one day I was walking along
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
And you know I heard a voice, but I saw no one
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
The voice I heard sounded oh so sweet
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
Came down from my head to sole of my feet
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)

Get away (get away Jordan)
Get away (get away ole chilly Jordan)
Get away, old chilly Jordan (get away Jordan)
I wanna cross over to see my Lord

[Verse 2: Jake Hess]
One of these mornings and it won't be long
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
You gonna look for me child, but Ill be gone
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
Just a few more risings and the settings of the sun
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
This old battle’ll be fought and my victory won
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
And now the friends I used to love so dear
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)
Done gone on to glory and left me here
(yes, I wanna cross over and see my Lord)

[Verse 3: Hovie Lister]
When my feet get cold, eyes are shut
Body done chilled by the hand of death
Tongue glued to the roof my mouth
Hands laid folded across my breast
Don’t have to worry bout the way I left
God almighty done told He'd be right there
Lift me up on his wings of love
Carry my soul to the heaven's above
They tell me Jordan’s deep and wide
But I promised mother I’d see her on the other side
[Chorus]
Get away (get away Jordan)
Oh, get away (get away ole chilly Jordan)
Get away back, old chilly Jordan (get away Jordan)
I wanna cross over to see my Lord
I said get away (get away Jordan)
Oh, get away (get away ole chilly Jordan)
Get away back, old chilly Jordan (get away Jordan)
I wanna cross over to see my Lord"

Paranoia is in bloom
The PR transmissions will resume
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
And hope that we will never see the truth around
(So come on)

Another promise, another seed
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
(So come on)

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious
(So come on)

[Verse 2]
Interchanging mind control
Come let the revolution take its toll
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
(So come on)
Rise up and take the power back
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
You know that their time's coming to an end
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend

[Chorus]
They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us
We will be victorious

They will not force us
They will stop degrading us
They will not control us

Walked out to the county line, breath in the light
A step down from the mighty high, they aren't my kind

Open space to move, need to feel the ride

Done dealin' with vampire neck bites

Close my eyes the ways were brutal
Close my eyes so I could get through
Freed little child on the inside
Crying, ""Where have you been?""

Don't make me go back, city's killin' me, let go

Bright Horses on the run
They couldn't face the rising Sun
Disappearings in L.A
People are missing in London
Snow came down during the night
For every night Bright Horses cry
While skyscrapers falling down
While skyscrapers falling down

[Verse 2]
Bright Horses running through the fields
From pain outside to pain within
Husbands missing in Tokyo
No trace of wives in Beijing
Their pain was just too much to take
Horses know better than anyone else
Raining demands to be felt
Burning demands to be felt

[Chorus]
Riding them makes perfect sense
When they've left you all alone
Seeing fire in their eyes
Makes you want to get aboard
Horses, they will hear you cry
And gladly join to cry with you
One question that remains is
How far will they walk you through?
[Verse 3]
Horses - they are moving
Far from us they run they run
Closer to where they were born
Somewhere between Mercury and Sun
Horses - they are moving
Far from us they run they run
Closer to where they were Born
Somewhere between Mercury and Sun
Bright Horses conquer night and day
Heartbreakers turn to ash and clay
Nowhere to hide in Amsterdam
Empty streets in Dar Es Salaam
What's left of us is set on fire
Very few Horses are left for hire
Get yourself One while you can
Steal yourself One while you can

[Chorus]
Riding them makes perfect sense
When they've left you all alone
Seeing fire in their eyes
Makes you want to get aboard
Horses, they will hear you cry
And gladly join to cry with you
One question that remains is
How far will they walk you through?

No One lives in Tokyo
Nobody lives in Beijing anymore
Only kids left in L.A
Situation in London is very same

No one cares, what they've done
Bright Horses
No one cares, what they've done

No one cares, what they've done
Bright Horses
No one cares, what they've done"

Torn is my flesh
Just like the sould inside it

And read my soul
Exposed are the bloody sins of me
My eyes stare cold
I tremble in madness
Flesh lays naked
Demons are screaming

Dagger of darkness
Hasted through my skin

Marked as the marvellous lamb
The black beast
The lamb forlorn of god
My flesh is the feast
Satan, Take my blood

I slowly cut
Life out of me
Satan Lord
My blood is Thine

Finding salvation
Through self mutilation
Draining myself
My soul is soaked
Now without god
And without grace
Yet all this

Truthfully, it's hard to say that people care until I die
Then they'll reminiscence, sayin' man, I knew that guy!
But they never understood my silent cry
Violent that I hid inside, compliant to the grave that I dig at night
Backtracking on my music, tryna find some quotes
Saying RIP, but i rest between, lines of my paper notes
I've been the truth, but nobody wanna hear it
Face to face with reality of youth in our spirits
There are people wishing I would cease to еxist
So when I die, I hope you seek pеace to your abyss
My lyrics are like permanent scars, that never go away
Gaze up in the stars, they dead, but they light the way
I may be laying in my coffin, but i've never fallen
Cuz I know what I stood for, 10 toes on the wood floor
Hard to live in this hell, when i'm feeling heaven-sent
Maybe I should yell, portrayed to what the message said

[verse] poetic mind
You ever feel like people only there just for advantage?
Then when you offer nothing, suddenly they vanish?
I'm sick everybody always saying that'll i'll be your friend
But when you try to reach out, tell me where they been?
All it seems, is cash money checks & that cheap talk
Living my dreams, definition of my sleep walk
If the sheep gawk, I'll be me, till' the beats stop
I ain't handing out my plate, forget the feed-stocks
Everybody co-exist with separation, you & me
Hopefully we see progression, man I want some unity
Society it ruined me, but this ain't nothing to me
I started underground, built foundation with community's
I'm devastated always waited, for the fate that always weighed-in
Saying blood but always rated, that my plate would never make it
Always hated, when they say it, going straight in, music never fadin
So if I fade, today ill never cease your mental state"

This regret, it leaves another bitter taste
Yeah

Why does the sun shine
But only when I slip and make a new mistake?
‘Cause I hate the feeling it’s all a waste

If I could cut away my fate with this blade

I would if that’d let me re-start
But something tells me if that happened
I might not see you there

I’m only held by the limit inside my soul
The voice in my heart -
I trust it will break the mold that it holds

It will never end - May it never end
No matter what’s in store
We must be faster ‘cause right now there’s no more time
I fear at this rate, the world will leave us behind - And so I
Wonder how long I have left with you, in this life?
There’s not a minute we should waste

3332,"And so finally here we are, at the beginning of a whole new era. The start of a brand new world
And now what?
How do we start?
How do we begin again?

There are some things you can simply look up, such as:
The size of Greenland, the dates of the famous 19th century rubber wars, Persian adjectives, the composition of snow
And other things you just have to guess at

And then again today's the day and those were the days and now these are the days and now the clock points histrionically to noon. Some new kind of north
And so which way do we go?
What are days for? To wake us up, to put between the endless nights

And by the way, here's my theory of punctuation:
Instead of a period at the end of each sentence, there should be a tiny clock that shows you how long it took you to write that sentence

And another way to look at time is this:
There was an old married couple and they had always hated each other, never been able to stand the sight of each other, really. And when they were in their nineties, they finally got divorced. And people said ""Why did you wait so long? Why didn't you do this a whole lot earlier?"" And they said ""Well, we wanted to wait until the children died.""

Ah, America. And yes, that will be America; a whole new place just waiting to happen. Broken-up parking lots, rotten dumps, speedballs, accidents and hesitations, things left behind. Styrofoam, computer chips...
And Jim and John, oh, they were there, And Carol, too. Her hair pinned up in that weird beehive way she loved so much, and Greg and Phil, moving at the pace of summer
And Uncle Al, who screamed all night in the attic. Yes, something happened to him in the war, they said, over in France, and France had become something they never mentioned, something dangerous

Yeah, some were sad to see those days disappear. The flea markets and their smells, the war
All the old belongings strewn out on the sidewalks, mildewed clothes and old resentments and ragged record jackets

And ah, these days. Oh, these days
What are days for? To wake us up, to put between the endless nights

And meanwhile all over town, checks are bouncing and accounts are being automatically closed, passwords are expiring, and everyone's counting and comparing and predicting:
Will it be the best of times, will it be the worst of times, or will it just be another one of those times?

Show of hands, please

And ah, this world, which like Kierkegaard said, can only be understood when lived backwards. Which would entail an incredible amount of planning and confusion
And then there are those big questions always in the back of your mind. Things like:
Are those two people over there actually my real parents?
Should I get a second Prius?

And you, you who can be silent in four languages:
Your silence will be considered your consent

Oh but those were the days before the audience, and what the audience wanted, and what the audience said it wanted

And you know the reason I really love the stars is that we cannot hurt them. We can't burn them or melt them or make them overflow. We can't flood them or blow them up or burn them out
But we are reaching for them
We are reaching for them
Some say our empire is passing, as all empires do
And others haven't a clue what time it is or where it goes or even where the clock is

And oh, the majesty of dreams. An unstoppable train. Different colored wonderlands, freedom of speech and sex with strangers

Dear old God: May I call you old?
And may I ask: Who are these people?

Ah, America. We saw it. We tipped it over, and then, we sold it. These are the things I whisper softly to my dolls, those heartless little thugs dressed in calico kilts and jaunty hats, and their perpetual white toothy smiles

And oh, my brothers. And oh, my sisters. What are days for?
Days are where we live. They flow and then they flow. They come, they fade, they go and they go. No way to know exactly when they start or when their time is up

Oh, another day, another dime
Another day in America
Another day, another dollar
Another day in America

And all my brothers. And all my long lost sisters
How do we begin again?
How do we begin?"

Oh, when you were falling faster than you could fathom, there was nothing underneath you
Why'd it take you so long to learn that everything that's built must disappear?
Oh, when you were sinking faster than you could imagine, there was no one there to save you
Why'd it take you so long to learn that everything that's there will disappear?
Oh, when you

They say these things happen for a reason
We all know that's bullshit
That's just what people say to make you feel better
Breathe in now
Here's your memo

[Verse 2]
Oh, when you were thinking that there were ways to salvage certain things that had been damaged
Why'd it take you so long to learn that everything that's built must disappear?
Oh, when you were dreamin' 'bout some things that never happened, there was no one there to tell you
Why'd it take you so long to learn that everything that's there will disappear?
Oh, when you
And I was so
Functional
[Interlude 2]
I'm not gonna say I saw it coming
But in hindsight, I had been a total fucking idiot
But everyone's a total fucking idiot sometimes, right?
Right?
And when I look back on this moment
Think about it in hindsight
When am I gonna say I was a total fucking idiot about that?
What's happening now with you?

[Verse 3]
Oh, when you were sinking faster than you could imagine, there was no one there to save you
Why'd it take you so long to learn that everything that's there will disappear?

Do you like your gift?
Sippin' on our bourbon

When I loved you I kinda lost myself
Now the distance hurts like hell

It's the way that you pulled me in
A black hole no coming back
You were the first, the last and the worst
I don't wanna feel again

From opening up, I don't wanna trust
It's the way that you said goodbye
After you heard me cry
I don't wanna love, what happened to us
I don't wanna feel again
If this is all that you get
You were the first, the last and the worst
I still got your finger
Print on my phone
You knew all my secrets
The ones I never told

I'm looking at these pictures
And the video
Thanks for the audition
But your script is old

I might've loved you more than myself
Now you're singing with somebody else

It's the way that you pulled me in

So many years have passed the day since we fell in love
And promised we'd never separate
But it seems the time has come

That you feelin dark inside and u should let me be your light
Picture shit in different angles to your left and to your right
It feel like I’m full of bad so I can never do
None right
Kinda like when niggas envy you can’t get it over night
Saying niggas in your plate the ones that stirring up the hype
I said damn why u had to take my nigga lord
When all these niggas Down the street Steady askin for it
Not to far down the road
Caught a statue to him
You livin n breathin I swear to god I’m prayin for you
Amen
Niggas in the city go hard they winning
See u only want the diamonds they really addicted it’s hard how they livin
She makin calls oh no she can’t forgive me
That’s from your heart if you tell me u wit me
Just make a call imma get it empty
They like fall back im like really
My energy on different can u feel me"

Do or Die Music
Someone once told me that if you treat every situation like Do or Die you’re gunna die a lot
I disagree
I think that when your backs against the wall... you make it happen
So if you hungry... Eat
(Sample)
“Tell me what (What!), what would I do? If I could feel.”
..If I could feel

[Verse 1: D-Celli]
If I could feel the feelings felt when dudes feel my shit
A place to live off a hook and a bridge
A playa’ ain’t a gangsta’, but he handles his biz
I got my pen pushing ink it’s where the magic exists
Everyday is Christmas; getting paid for my gift
And my checks are getting signed for a flick of my wrist. (For now..)
I’m pinching pennies, pushing dimes
Hittin’ chicks, kickin’ rhymes
Flipping shit to get me mines
Do or Die to get me signed
Sick of being Curb Servant;
Curb serving, meant for a bigger purpose
Praying for the days when I could say that is was worth it
God answered back and said I need you to deserve it
(Woah)
What would you do if you could walk in my shoes?
Making every move like you got something to prove?
All or nothing, ain’t a Nothing to choose
So your life is on the line like you got nothing to lose
I’m tryna double up, on the double down
Practicing, ""Who's the dummy now?""
Only dapps when I come around
Now they don’t make a sound
Spitting for the kids who music loud to drown the sound of screamin
When life ain't peachy; don’t mean this then you deceive this
Every body love me now no matter the reason
Just Surviving the Times of Do or Die
Tell the truth or tell a lie
Grind or get crucified
Live fly or get scrutinized
Cause they say its bout your -ism like a euphemi-
A euphemis, Are you famous?
If so, then what am I?
Fathers play the villain, only dad was Father Time
Burning bushes, so my blunts look like I’m holding pine
Sqeezing ti-tis like I’m holding .9s
Mom's only son, I was born to shine
(Mom's only son, I was born to shine)
(Born to Shine)
It’s Do or Die"

Say my name
Say my name

Say baby I love you

Any other day I would call
You would say
""Baby, how's your day?""
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is ""Uh huh"", ""Yeah, okay""
Could it be that you
Are at the crib with another lady
If you took it there
First of all let me say I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me I'm the one that you claim
Why don't you say the things
That you said to me yesterday
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause girl I know just how you do
Where you're saying everything to me times two
So Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there, then tell me who
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name (baby)
You actin' kinda shady (why you acting so shady)
Ain't callin' me baby (I don't need that baby)
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Say baby I love you If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby

Say baby I love you If you ain't runnin' game (Say my name, say my name)

Lord, help me stay on the path and not sway
Forgive me for my sins and wash the badness away
Don’t ever let me stray pay me mind when I pray
What I’m saying now is how I’ll say it on my final day
Keep me good and if you may; in every minor way
Don’t let me fall closer to those who will suffer and will pay

[Verse 1]
But who in the hell wouldn’t fight for a life and rights of the richest?
Then who could ever tell they might incite some fright in those bitches
It’s not about frightening tonight, or indictment now is it?
I have a sense of excitement to write enlightenment with it
So what the fuck am I saying laying rhymes five times
Did I Lose my mind from drugs or by committing those crimes?
Torn at what I’m sworn to believe in by deceiving man kind
It’s my past that’s so bad I’m forced to leave it behind
Man fuck it I’ma problem child, I’ll be glad to admit it
I’ma add that I’ll be glad that you’ll be mad that I did it
I’m positive you’d move on, and won't be sad if I didn’t
So fuck off I’m doing me, a tad bit mad with A fitted
Who spits it harder than it is for half the masses to make it
Kiss his ass cause he’s fast he’ll be the last who gon fake it
He see’s his dreams he gon take it and fuck who says that he couldn’t
He could tell them how he sees it, but he shouldn’t and wouldn’t (well here it goes)

You got to dream, homie money is power
You got to dream, homie money is power
You got to dream, homie money is power
Every minute every hour, homie money is power (x2)

[Verse 2]
No cream, just a dream. Of course to blow up
I was a kid at heart from the start then forced to grow up
Turned mean at seventeen, was kicked out on the streets
Holding down a couple jobs and dropping bombs on these beats
Man I’m Rhyming so much times that I’m kind of hoarsely
What has set inside my mind won't pry, try to force me
Got jack without a dime for either fine or the court fee
The fact's I’d rather rhyme but all this crime supports me
But you don’t know what it’s like to live the life that I live in
Always pissed but I persist when my inside says give in
I’m different from any other guy who rhymes, my mission
Is to live it how I feel and how I eye it in my vision
Cause man a nine to five life won’t ever be right for me
Even if I’m on the streets every night that it’s stormy
I'ma fight and be alright cause in sight is my trophy
I’ll hopefully inject respect, if I combine these lines dopely

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They hate him for the way he dresses the way that he walks
The way that he expresses himself in the way that he talks
But he’ll rise in front of eyes of all the guys that would doubt ‘em
I do it it for my fans whos' parents never gave a fuck about them
Plus I started conceiving these thoughts of money, ain't greedy
And I ain't needy but my grievance just makes all of it be me
Theres a force that’s so big that once you get it it’s funny
And of course I love my soul but shit I sold it for money
Follow me without sorrow, I promise that you can do it
Live today and plan tomorrow, got a past? then get through it
Thinking fast and I just laugh when they all ask how I knew it
I’m the illest I just kill it others went up and blew it
I see my chances all enhanced as I go dance with the devil
Maybe that’s the reason that I sag my pants while your level
But I'ma have to bow down to the rock cause I see it
I can vision a better me now I'ma go out and be it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let us take off the mask that’s blindfolding the masses
And lash out on the establishment and burn it to ashes
We’re being fooled by the machine, like a nazi regime
I see em' with money, where's my America dream?
Now your scared and you scream pulling out your hair at the seam
All the debt just keeps increasing something's there you don’t see
While their there up in the air without a care where there free
They have the muthafucking power never you and not me

You got to dream, homie money is power

Now everywhere you'll ever be, at least you will remember me

Comin' to you live in your direction
Surely to be legends on our exit
Now that the flows perfected
The only other challenge
Is tryna find the balance
Of playing with your talent and obsession
As we proceed it's kickin' up in degrees
A different kinda steel that's picking up in the east
Forewarning, we hit the track banging over beats
How could they ever ever think they can compete is beyond me but
Life can take a toll until you've had enough
Yea we're gettin' paid for shows but it ain't adding up
I guess they're praying on your downfall but we get right back up, because the crowd calls
In the studio I'm tryna get my sound right
Keep my cool spittin' fire through the sound byte
Damn... It's just a matter of time

Yea...yea that's right, we're giving that vibe
Call it karma was a monster in a past life
And with that energy two things you fin' to be
A beast at taking L's, or king of the winning streak
They half as nice but touring twice as much
Money stay the same but bills are piling up
The light is fading, have you lost your touch?
You only get applause for your covers huh?
Why is the glass always half full?
Mom just had an operation, now it's round two
Damn.... It's just a matter of time...
Meanwhile I've got this feeling in the back of my mind I'm like...

Ya caught the vibe, which means you've been inflicted

But we'll be on top that's without a doubt"

Had never seemed a crime
But still I felt the punishment of disapproving eyes
The criticism misconstrued
Had driven me away
In bitterness which helped create the world I grew to hate

'Round and 'Round and 'Round and 'Round we go
Divided by the things we can't show
Now, you're standing beside yourself
In anger, you hide yourself
Afraid for me
Inside, is something no words can reach
And only that time could teach
Now I anxiously await Our Reunion

A feeling that I couldn't place
A reflection I couldn't face
By making you my enemy, it was easy to run from me
Naivete's distorted view
All the things I thought I knew
Now I finally understand what separates the ""men"" from the man
'Round and 'Round and 'Round and 'Round we go

Now, you're standing beside yourself

It would Probably be something like this

Wound up, bound up in submission
Getting lost in the mission
False definitions been causing division
All these people talking competition
All these people talking is division

I mean talk television
Cops, politicians
Internet wisdom caught up in opinions
But what kind of thoughts we giving
It's 2015 this is what I call ambition

Wrote an album
And it took alot of luck
And it took a lot of rum
And it looked alot of fun
Be careful what you wish for it could be what you want
I played a role in my mind
Let him stay too long
So he stole me blind
Left the oven light on
So he stole my shine
Now I keep the doors locked
And i close my blinds
I think I care just a little too much
It's hard to tell when enough's enough
They're only happy when I spill my guts
And I'm only happy when she fills my cup

Can you imagine a place, where all the trials
And tribulations of the world, don't exist ha-ha
It's a real place, but right now it only exists in man's mind
Because the reality of it is that, until the time comes
For you to get there, you can only picture it
So what I wanna do, is give you a sneak preview of it
From my perception, yeah, watch this

[K-Rino]
Nothing but happiness and peace felt daily
A place where your children and babies can play safely
Where people genuinely believe in being friendly
No such thing as hatred and no memory of envy
With no problems to face every morning when you awaken
You can sleep with doors wide open and nobody will break in
Where love's force field is too solid to be shaken
Where each child grows up to be great women and great men
No depression or loneliness and no sad moments
And people full grown who've never heard of being homeless
Where we manifest our gifts and no dream is too distant
And there are no hospitals cause sickness is non existent
And love perpetuates itself, while no child suffers
And treatment of one another is not based around color
And you'll never hear slander come from anyone's tongue
And a hundred years old is still considered young
[Hook]
In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E

[K-Rino]
Nations wouldn't verbally spar with one another
Point out flaws or seek to go to war with each other
Each person has a place and a purpose destined to flourish
No child is ever hurt or malnourished, money is worthless
We learned in the most spiritually advanced schools
And everything is done God's way, no manmade rules
And poverty is no longer in man's vocabulary
Erased from human thought, recollection or dictionary
No dream, the most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Every living being gleaming with infinite self esteem
And belief in the all wise, ruler and best planner
We walk the planet in the most harmonious manner
Where those who rest and hid, get uncountable blessings
Total strangers are trustworthy with your most prized possessions
If a man gives his word, he keeps it with no deception
And a mind full of knowledge is the only loaded weapon
[Hook]
In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise

Is this Heaven or the hereafter, the geographical area post rapture
The Book of Life's unclear chapter
If it's in the sky, then who derived it?
Find someone who's ever died and visualized it and returned here to describe it
Since none, have carried out that mission
The question isn't if it's real, the question is is it a place or a condition
See Heaven has a great description, but men exaggerate and create division
Make up written lies and fabricate depictions
So stop imagining, and understand the basics
Your place being in a heavenly state is self created
That old statement life is what you make it, is a true one
Your old existence erase it and replace it with a new one
See years of resentment left your progress restricted
New love can never move into your heart till hate's evicted
And this place that I've pictured
Look inside if you wondering where is it, you don't have to give your spirit up to visit
[Hook]
In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E"
1580,"I was comatosed
But I have to say
I don’t criticize no one
Every time I drank
I’d be nearly dead
From polluted alcohol

I was sick inside my skull
By the summer could not recall
Tell me if
And I would never mind
If I remembered why
Tell me that
So I can take a photograph
That never fades

Was I compromised
By a bottle saved?
I won’t criticize no one
‘Cos I don’t hear nothing around
But a strange kind of muffled sound
Hey child, it won’t leave us alone
But I can’t understand it all
There’s wonder on the faces
And wonder in the lull
To a strange kind of muffled sound

Hate is all around
Hate is all around
Wonder on the faces
Wonder in the lull

I was sickened by the photograph I saw

Were we compromised
By the bottle saved?
Can’t we criticize no one?
Every time we drank
We were nearly dead
From polluted alcohol

Hey child, listen for the phone
I tell you now, the bell will ring
I don’t hear a rustled tree
Just a strange kind of muffled sound
Just a strange kind of muffled sound
Just a strange kind of muffled sound
There is out there a constant malevolent force
And it seems to move between a parody and common legitimate course
What you don’t understand, you don’t need to question if it’s all the same
‘Cos it’s taken its toll through the lies, the just, and those who treated it as a game"
3422,"In the mirror of your life
In the void of illusions
All your thoughts like a knife
All thoughts just confusion

Don’t break the mirror of your soul
Don’t catch the shadow
On the black wall

In the mirror of your dream
So many blind hopes and roads
How long will you scream?
Until you reach the row
How long? How long?
How long will you wander?

Don’t break the mirror of your soul
Don’t catch the shadow
On the black wall

You lost yourself and desire for light
Has changed into eternal flight
Lost yourself and desire for life
How long will you wander?
Don’t break the mirror of your soul
Don’t catch the shadow
On the black wall"

[Verse 1]
Niggas be straight frontin'
I move around with the thing on my waist thugging
It's no hate, I don't hate nothing
Man I told them they ain't like that
And none of them ain't sayin' nothing
Man I came out the gate buzzing
Never let a nigga stand and my fate bluffing
Warrup son, ain't nothing
I took so much money in the start
Niggas think I'm bank cutting
Ayo DJ play something
The south cool we be digging they wave cousin
We getting drunk we straight bugging
Brooklyn niggas up in here homie
We ready to lace something
I breathe heavy still got that weed in my lungs
Them lames hating on me but tell them I'm back son
New York on my back it's a rap the rap's gone

He say he up in the can his name was ringing
I don't believe 'em, I don't believe you
I ain't see that when I see you
I straight try you man I don't leave you
What I carry in them robin jeans is lethal
They couldn't mess with me when I was wearing vin diesel
Always bragging you with the next man chick
But that make you a snake if that man in your cling
And then that dogs they don't know what they doin'
Always tryin' to get views until you give 'em a viewing
Funeral home another life ruined
All the cheap shots stop when niggas start shooting
Airing them if they start moving leave 'em with all dirty three in his back
Treating them like Patrick Vieira

In case you to the death of me
The dream is the album coming soon
I know you hear my footsteps bozo

7789,"You are not alone my brother
I have always been with you
Have we eaten something deadly
Something poisonous consumed
I just longed for days that were simple
When books still held the golden keys
But I know that to be an illusion
Know that they were never that way
I'm not a God Damn machine man
I've got two arms and two eyes
Guess this is what we lost sight of
Swallowed it with no reply
Will what this world's made of me
Bring only venting of hatred on my family
Fruit of my labor the desecration of everything sacred to me
Victims of this great temper
The pent up frustration living has buried in me
Brought down upon the ones that I love
And those who I sing these songs for
I just long for days that were simple
When books still held the golden keys
But I know that to be an illusion
Know that they were never that way
It's been years since I screamed out at the sky
Like my father, A choice to make the decision was mine
Every son can blame this
I'm not that man, drop it repeat
It's not what happens it's how it's dealt with
Your not that man drop it repeat
There's only so much that's in our hands
The casing for this powerful spirit
Tires but is strengthened by what's been put before
Everyone must spend their due time
Feeling sick, so sick inside
There's a certain sense of violence
In the way a family takes place"

Go vegan just to cook her eggs
And if I’m making a mistake,
Believe it’s already been made
And if she smokes a pack a day,
Well, I guess even that’s okay
I lost my asthma anyway
It would have loved her, it’s a shame

That she lets me borrow all her books,
And I catch her shooting me these looks,
Wish I were smart enough for her

One, you don’t know how great you are,
And you are leaving me

And you are leaving me
But I know I’ll get over that eventually,

Trapped by flames of fury

Death is their desire
Thrown in the fire!

Merry month of May, sunny skies of blue
Clouds have rolled away and the sun peeps thru
May express happiness
Joy you may define in a thousand ways
But a case like mine needs a special phrase
To reveal how I feel

I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see? I'm in love

Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so and so
If I should ever let go

Lemme cry on this. Just explain myself cause i'm so upset these days and imma no lie right now

Sometimes I feel I wanna scream
There's nothing's gonna work this way for me
Feel I wanna scream
Everyday I feel I'm sinking deep

(VERSE 1)
I'm closed to a schizo
I'm so inside of me though
I feel I wanna scream cause I've been working on myself yow
Never feel a change yow
I'm closed to a slave to the herbal haze
Everytime I wake up, gotta smoke a lot
I started to stop before I stopped to start
And then I start to fall, then I start to fall
Fell into a depression, I had only bad impressions
Cause weed is good for creation
And spiritual meditation
Some call it their medication
And this ain't no contradiction
But when I look at my conditions
All I need is good correction
I barely hold conversations
And fulfill my obligations
I need to find me back strong
And gimme good education
Distrust's so fucking wrong
In any of your relations
Especially with yourself
Won't you leaving your shell, jay, jayyy

Deceivin all my people one by one continually
My best friends, mama and grandparents too
Now all of dem, tell them that jeremie is doin' good
He's only inna phase that he been working to be change
Cause he's always on the blame and he sees him as a shame (x2)
Pray this season gonna changed, gon be burning inna flame
This the stop and go flow, when the head is gon low
And nobody really know, cause you in the low low
Interactions no no, and reactions so so
I neglected soberness now it affecting my affects
Got a cupple of friends, but only few understand
Just a few tend their hands, if i'd only knew the shit
That i be there goin' in, I don't know where to looking
And i don't know what to saying, you must believe
I was thinking of my words, searching for the answers
Have you ever put on a paper, what you will saying to your brothers
I was dealing so much pressure for a simple get together
Have you ever feel so wasted, that you hate everything you say
Then brother discourage cause you being so tatty
Don't wanna bother you but it's bothering me"

No longer sleep where I stay
And it's colder
From deep blue to steel gray

Put two feet on the ground

Bodies strewn, ritual complete, true horror revealed
It is winter now and no man can bear to witness these sites, but these aren’t really men are they?
The butcher, the priest, the god who has forsaken you when you needed them most

Spirits fade into the mist
Under the gaze; the stained-glass eye
Wisps sway above the fields of ice
Red-stained glass, as above so below

The butcher, the priest and the god who has left you
Just when you held out your hand
Almighty beloved the great absentee
Punish each other, releasing us free

They will march in winter
There’s no help
All the weakened, dying
Join our dead

They’ll defile your honor
This is Hell
No name spoken
No story to tell
No stories to tell

As We Forget
The siren’s song
In our ears
All along

Clean break
Herded with the outcasts
Freezing without sun
Dying by the hundreds
With nowhere to run

Sleeping with our nightmares
Day brings no relief
Buried are our hopes and
Our bloodstained dreams

This is a deathwish
Join us in our hell
Breathing isn’t living
Nobody could tell

Sleeping with our nightmares
Day brings no relief
Buried are our hopes and
Our bloodstained dreams
No story to tell
Join us in hell"

Trying to fill that empty feeling
Trying hard to keep from dealing drugs
I was much to young to take it
Back, when it was hard to make it
On the run with a gun
Or with a gang of thugs

Three time loser, it's all behind me now

Twice I fell in love and married
Thinking that the past was buried
Funny how those women carried on
Swearing that our love was dying
Like the weeping willow crying
Through the night and every fight
Until our love was gone

Freedom lost and love gone sour
Losing minutes by the hour
To afraid to let my sorrow show
Dying slow from to much drinking
Quitting when I started sinking
To the bottom of the bottle

The part with the strings
Broken hearts laid on old wooden machines

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
'Tis you must go, 'tis you must go and I must bide

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I may well be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an ""Ave"" there for me

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave shall warm and sweeter be
If you will bend and tell me that you love me
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me"

I want it all till I fall I rep it still
Dream of the life, what separate is a decimal
Counting my decibels
Till the red white and blue are down in my avenue of my happiness in pursuit
I cruise till I die, abuse my bad side, I love
Tell a Jekyll I’m finding nothing to hide, the crime is in my mind
Inside a weed bowl
We’re fly till we die, reside in Heathrow, I go
Where the river had never flow
Found a new flame deep inside of a matador
You gotta new bitch, nonna that even matter tho
When I love her, weed Guinness and adderall
Heard time is money but ain’t shit on my wrist
This still doesn’t exist
Til you blew me a kiss
This love too blind I’ll survive in the mist
Peter pan and the lost boys be riding to this
I’ll grab the mic and I switch
Another rhythm know my blessing is flow
They could sell us all short, but I’m betting we’ll grow
Got your feet on my shoulders it’s pressing forever heavy
We’re straight on a charge, I’m gunning forever ready and never wary to go in
Smoking on something potent
I’m counting every blessing and guessing it when I’m coping
Hope in, the dark, I’ll be seeing the light now, pipe down
I need you to promise me right now !
[Chorus]
I just need you here right now
I must live in fear right now
That if we can’t be, afraid to see me as a lover like
Better leave that shit for another night
I just need you here right now
I must live in fear right now
That if I go, I’ll never know
My curtain closed

[Verse 2]
If love is a foregone conclusion
I’ll die when it ends, and live for the illusion
The butterfly break cocoons that abuse him
We talking bout God or talking 'bout evolution?
Immune to a slow growth but you were using her
These walls talk but I know they ain't amusing a
Black abyss bottle clenched in a wrist
Swallow three times making a wish, until I’m faking a switch
And seeing light of my darker days
Bright as a sparkled haze
Find as I’m parting ways, regret it
The road to riches prey on the next dude to tread it
Your story never ending you best do the credit, I
Bled it indebted
And every scar is regretted
I cheated death like mike losing count of my blessings
I’m on my knees with the reverend
My bible lie in each sentence till
Money trees drip blood on the leaves, my penance is GONE
[Chorus]
I just need you here right now
I must live in fear right now
That if we can’t be, afraid to see me as a lover like
Better leave that shit for another night

5773,"On a cold frosty morning as I stood on the mountain
Watching the smoke from below
It was strolling from a tall and slender smokestack
Way down on the Southern Railroad

It was the '97, the fastest mail train
That the South had ever seen
But she run too fast on that fatal Sunday evening
And the death toll, it numbered sixteen

On this cold, frosty morning of which I tell you
The ground was covered with snow
Old '97 left Washington City
Like an arrow shot from a bow

They give him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Saying, ""Steve, you're way behind time
This is not '38, but it's old '97
You must put her in Spencer on time""

Well, he looked over at his black, greasy fireman
Saying, ""Shovel in a little more coal
And when we cross little White Oak Mountain
You can watch old '97 roll""
They were going down grade, making ninety miles-an-hour
When his whistle began to scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on his throttle
And was scalded to death by the steam

Oh, a telegraph come to Washington City
And this is what it said
""The brave engineer that run Old '97
Is lying in North Danville, dead""

Oh its come all, you ladies, you must take warning
From this time now and on
Never speak harsh words to a true-loving husband
He may leave you and never return"

'Cause everybody knows there are stories to be told

There's a girl that dances down in Chinatown (Chinatown!)
Men all come from miles around and lay their money down
Prettiest thing you'd ever seen down in Chinatown (Chinatown!)
When the lights come down she'll light you up down in Chinatown

She'd throw it all away, all the time and chardonnay
If only for a man could love her
With no strings attached
There's a girl that dances down in Chinatown (Chinatown!)
Thinks about the man she knew back in her hometown

And moments are lost on the wind
Opportunities for love pass unseen
Unexplored, tears form iterated icicles
A bed unruffled and untouched
Detoured years
Quiet moments seem yours and comforting
Alone to your thoughts; your dreams,
Hang motionless in the sky
There is a freedom in the open sky
A blue heaven of cloud, feather, and bug
To shepherd the sun to the moss covered earth"

Day 1
Teisha tried cuffing me like a mark
I told that chick to beat it
Discriminate with my cock
If Micheal Jackson'd seen it
He’d probably would be in shock
A dark skinned turning down yellow bones is a rock
To the psyche
Cuz women think it's unlikley
A shade from white and ripe
Why wouldn't that nigga like me
Guess she didn't know I identified her as hoe
And it wasn't in my plan for her coochie to have control
Day 2
Restless
In need of something to do
And if you got the plug
I'll be needing something from you
Though it's 82 degrees
My demeanor is mighty cold
Cuz no God is in my soul
But these demons still comin' through
Crackheads and scams run rampant across campus
Murk bandits, though outlandish paint the canvas
Hoes brandish ass and tits then vanish
Into a niggas room to get some dick
So I assume
Day 3 was key
Cuz I finally had went to class
Sat in homeroom while staring out of the glass
Thinking a degree would put me on the right path
But the second it turned 3 my motivation had passed
Went outside to smoke
I met a nigga named Jaz
We both liked to rap and immediately start to spazz
Bustin’ freestyles like hymens when Vikings Clash
When I noticed a group
A couple hours had passed
Day 4
Accustomed to campus and how it works
See, if you have the bread
The pretty women will flirt
And if you packin’ lead
The hood niggas respect you
But if you lack the cred
They'll prob’ly treat you like dirt
Met a man in red
Big Homie I'll call him Zues
He spoke on aspirations of bangers calling a truce
Usually I choose not to listen to peoples views
But a couple hours prior was sippin' on gin and juice
Day 5
Sick of the lies
In lack of drive
Same people who'll deface you
Won’t face you they'd rather hide
Spreading false tales like bards
While drunk and high
When sober they'd tuck tail
And couldn't remember why
Tried to go to sleep
12 Hours after the noon
But couldn't help to notice
Screaming from the other room
Went out to find peace
In the cover of the moon
A man followed
Bragging 'bout his brother sharing poon
He asked me for a blunt
I told him I'd have it soon
As I walk downstairs
I caught a whiff of perfume
That's when I'd seen her walking
A beauty that'd make you swoon
Then I realized she just got tossed by two goons
Damn
FSU, FSU, FSU
I never go to class
So they wonder what I do
FSU, FSU, FSU
I never go to class
Cuz I'm always on the move

Month 1
Smoke on the daily but not for fun
Im tryna keep my cool like albinos hiding from sun
Plus I got a tool, but haven't told anyone
So if someone's acting petty they won't be ready to run
Took my father's whip
Thinkin' to myself don't slip
Then caught a flat tire 4/5ths of the way on my trip
My phone started ringing
My pops he was screaming 'bout my grades, Oh shit
Month 2
Really start fucking with homie Zues
Still haven't gone to class
The academic recluse
But I needed cash my parents said they were through
Plus if they knew I smoked
I'd prob'ly go hungry too
Trading English papers and 20's for now will do
Though somethings got to move
For this sitch I'm in to improve
Hanging with the crew
I ain't really in the mood
But Jaz called talking 'bout a party with some food
Month 3 We decided to flip a pack
Take a hound south and bring the merchandise back
Made the trip twice the second just wasn't laxed
The homies peeped a garage with 30 birds in the back
Doubled back
Then we talked about the house we was at
The rumors said it's a fed's so we took it as fact
It wasn't that we were scared
We just knew how to act
Plus it could've been a sting
Who'd want to get caught in that
Month 4
Niggas start knocking all on my door
Im like the lowest bidder
Prescriptions you can afford
For every ten I sell
I'm making another four
I give the homie twelve
He helped me get in the door
Watching for the 12
Cuz I'm who they lookin' for
When women give me hell
I think back on Day 4
I called it so well it's what I pushed my fate towards
If life's a game of spades I can finally make board
Month 5
Finals arrive and I was shook
Attendance almost zero
It wouldn't be overlooked
Zues told me how the homies plans were undercooked
Them niggas hit the lick we skipped and got booked
40 years all over a suicide mission
I'll be 58 when them niggas get out of prison
Whether by luck or fate
I could've been in the system
And underneath that weight
Decided to stop whipin'
FSU, FSU, FSU
I never go to class
So they wonder what I do
FSU, FSU, FSU
I never go to class
Cuz I'm always on the move"

Exhausted to say the least, but I take my seat

But what I think is complete is far from what I need
Yeah, I need, exactly what you think
Something twisted up then get me another drink
I’m on the brink of a sick line; I feel it in my sick spine
Flow like I made rhine, a lunatic with quick rhymes
Purple Panda, read my propaganda

Old Saint Andrew, Spit flow with my hand dude
Composing like a band do, my lyrics will command you
To listen and learn as you cruise and burn

Call me Brett Favre, cause you know that I'mma never quit
Don’t fuck wit me like celibate, reasoning irrelevant

Rolling down town in my doctor J jersey
I got 32 grams of that julius erving
I don’t give no mercy, I am teaching you are learning
And that smell you smell is me cause I’m always burning
I smoking lotta weed, seal doobies with my tongue

Captain P at your service, I’m serving captain Morgan
To ride with me you gotta have your own Purple Jordans
Let the smoke fill your lungs, collect weed like we’re hoarding

God’s most noble warrior perennial
Light flowing like trinkets of gold
The dragon den is something to behold
Notice my control over the elements
I shift stout mountains like a pebble in my path now I’m flying space crafts
Drafting plans of interstellar travel. What worlds will I unravel
Time is not of our realm, it babbles like creeks in the summer time
Heat speaks hot like devils cry. Neat streaks not strike
Underlying forces form out reality spacial concavity
Forming moralities that lack posture
Humanity morphs into a monster
Abhorrent beasts with greed as its language
Consumes with glutton change changes its visage
To lie, cheat, steal our courage
Pay homage not cash
With that mind set, nothing of worth will last
Crass sayings from below leads you astray
And you think that becoming sheep is the way
To leave your mark on the world but it’s truly frightening
The Top is silencing, Belly grumbling
Blind eyes, stumbling. Mind, crushed by sin. Holy water, delve within
I’m a combination of cold winter bite with warm spring delight
Sipping tea while I write. I produce what I like and
Prolifically, struck with glee, an epiphany opened up by me for you
Who knew you choose your own destiny. Lost souls rest in peace
Still trying to figure it all out. Head’s in the clouds, still grounded though
Got years of my life, not worried though
Albeit the times get hard and desire turns to ash
My resolve is strong and built to last, my lass years for the days
Where my voice hit’s the stage and I pump up the volume
Laying way to bad taste
All around the world, they be chanting my name
All around the world, not addicted to fame
I’ll be playing my shows creating a frame
A structure that has fools jumping out of window panes
Into a world of power, a world of joy, let’s all unite and form a ploy
That takes down all those that try to destroy our innate abilities
Reach for the stars. Shut your ears off to those that harangue you
Grow disdain for the ones that betray you
You’re your own judge, own jury, check your worth, deemed worthy
On the cross, leave fury, no time for the swervey"

Somewhere beyond the blackened sky I hear her voice
Calling from my dreams

Far away beyond the sea, beyond this realm i'll wait

There is a place beyond the fire
The flaming hand of the god never touches down
Beyond the horizon
There is a place beyond the fire
The flaming hand of the god never touches down
In a far away land

Beyond the sea, beyond the sky, beyond the veil
Another world resides
Somewhere beyond the horizon you'll find me there
I'll wait forever

In my broken dreams i see the faces that have gone
I see the ones who've destroyed my life
Hatred consumes and darkness prevails
A veil between his heart and in his mind
Beyond the sea, beyond the sky
Beyond the veil another world resides
Inside of his mind"

Silver chain used to say it was white gold, rap music made me cooler than ice cold
Until my life froze and the good news of Christ interrupted like them commercials from Geico
And like Nitro, I quickly got rid of my Biggy and Tupac that made me feel like I was psycho
Said to myself, guess for me that rap's dead, started feening for them 808's like a crack head
All I needed was a window and a rope for suicide, but God provided the antidote

2515,"The character of Mr Square the philosopher, and of Mr Thwackum the divine; with a dispute concerning——

The name of this gentleman, who had then resided some time at Mr Allworthy's house, was Mr Square. His natural parts were not of the first rate, but he had greatly improved them by a learned education. He was deeply read in the antients, and a profest master of all the works of Plato and Aristotle. Upon which great models he had principally formed himself; sometimes according with the opinion of the one, and sometimes with that of the other. In morals he was a profest Platonist, and in religion he inclined to be an Aristotelian.

But though he had, as we have said, formed his morals on the Platonic model, yet he perfectly agreed with the opinion of Aristotle, in considering that great man rather in the quality of a philosopher or a speculatist, than as a legislator. This sentiment he carried a great way; indeed, so far, as to regard all virtue as matter of theory only. This, it is true, he never affirmed, as I have heard, to any one; and yet upon the least attention to his conduct, I cannot help thinking it was his real opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile some contradictions which might otherwise appear in his character.

This gentleman and Mr Thwackum scarce ever met without a disputation; for their tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other. Square held human nature to be the perfection of all virtue, and that vice was a deviation from our nature, in the same manner as deformity of body is. Thwackum, on the contrary, maintained that the human mind, since the fall, was nothing but a sink of iniquity, till purified and redeemed by grace. In one point only they agreed, which was, in all their discourses on morality never to mention the word goodness. The favourite phrase of the former, was the natural beauty of virtue; that of the latter, was the divine power of grace. The former measured all actions by the unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; the latter decided all matters by authority; but in doing this, he always used the scriptures and their commentators, as the lawyer doth his Coke upon Lyttleton, where the comment is of equal authority with the text.

After this short introduction, the reader will be pleased to remember, that the parson had concluded his speech with a triumphant question, to which he had apprehended no answer; viz., Can any honour exist independent on religion?

To this Square answered; that it was impossible to discourse philosophically concerning words, till their meaning was first established: that there were scarce any two words of a more vague and uncertain signification, than the two he had mentioned; for that there were almost as many different opinions concerning honour, as concerning religion. ""But,"" says he, ""if by honour you mean the true natural beauty of virtue, I will maintain it may exist independent of any religion whatever. Nay,"" added he, ""you yourself will allow it may exist independent of all but one: so will a Mahometan, a Jew, and all the maintainers of all the different sects in the world.""

Thwackum replied, this was arguing with the usual malice of all the enemies to the true Church. He said, he doubted not but that all the infidels and hereticks in the world would, if they could, confine honour to their own absurd errors and damnable deceptions; ""but honour,"" says he, ""is not therefore manifold, because there are many absurd opinions about it; nor is religion manifold, because there are various sects and heresies in the world. When I mention religion, I mean the Christian religion; and not only the Christian religion, but the Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant religion, but the Church of England. And when I mention honour, I mean that mode of Divine grace which is not only consistent with, but dependent upon, this religion; and is consistent with and dependent upon no other. Now to say that the honour I here mean, and which was, I thought, all the honour I could be supposed to mean, will uphold, much less dictate an untruth, is to assert an absurdity too shocking to be conceived.""

""I purposely avoided,"" says Square, ""drawing a conclusion which I thought evident from what I have said; but if you perceived it, I am sure you have not attempted to answer it. However, to drop the article of religion, I think it is plain, from what you have said, that we have different ideas of honour; or why do we not agree in the same terms of its explanation? I have asserted, that true honour and true virtue are almost synonymous terms, and they are both founded on the unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; to which an untruth being absolutely repugnant and contrary, it is certain that true honour cannot support an untruth. In this, therefore, I think we are agreed; but that this honour can be said to be founded on religion, to which it is antecedent, if by religion be meant any positive law—""

""I agree,"" answered Thwackum, with great warmth, ""with a man who asserts honour to be antecedent to religion! Mr Allworthy, did I agree—?""

He was proceeding when Mr Allworthy interposed, telling them very coldly, they had both mistaken his meaning; for that he had said nothing of true honour.—It is possible, however, he would not have easily quieted the disputants, who were growing equally warm, had not another matter now fallen out, which put a final end to the conversation at present."

Soon as I make it, best believe
I’ll be running home
I’ll be running home
I’ll be running back, to the 78
And the only way is UP baby, that’s why it’s on our plates
Baby it’s where I belong
Ain’t just some place that I stay
Ain’t just a place I was born
Baby it’s where I was raised

And I’ll be running home
I’ll be running home (Love my city like I)

Love my city like I love no bitch
I give a fuck, but that fuck go quick
I wish we had more time to work on this baby, ain’t my fault our clocks don’t sync
Baby I gotta leave, nah
Baby I’m leaving again
Mama said, “I know that you leaving a boy, better be back a man.”
That’s why I’m working, I’m working
All thе time, I’m working, I’m working
Overtime, I’m working, gotta work this
Causе if I ain’t got this, I’m nothing, ain’t shit else that’s worth it
Without this I’m nothing
Without a home I’m nothing
Where will I be when all else fails and nothing’s working

I’ll be running home

I’ll be running home

Shit ain't raw no more
Fake is how it is
I hear brothers talking 'bout shooting and killing
Then going home and chilling
Frontin' like a villain
Let me tell you something real
Is how the Mack feel
I ain't no criminal and represent no steel
I tell you one thing though
MC's better walk slow the Mack's on the earth
To let you know
I'm on a mission from the kingdom of God
To do away with MC's dat represent nimrod
You MC's have been too bad
So where you go now ice ya gonna wish you had
When MC's disappear it's my fault
It's time to put all the madness to a flying halt
And radio ya need to be ashamed
For pumping murder, murder, murder all up in
Our brain
I'll tell ya now Big Poppa don't like it
Representing truth when the Mack
Starts to mike it
I hope the subject don't turn ya away
But the whole Hip-Hop generation need to pray
Chorus
Whatcha gon do when God comes
You can front now, but when God comes
You can't get strapped for when God comes
Cuz you won't know how to act, when God comes

Now we all established dat Mack's new king
And the king for his people has to represent the
Right thing
Brothers in the ghetto stop genociding
Cause same boat we riding, will do like the Poseidon
I watched the earth's cheese line get longer, I watch
Allegiance to Satan's army looking stronger
I watched drugs and guns take control
I even watched how the devil take the Black woman's soul
They ain't got respect no more
When your ass on the camera you ain't nothing but a whore
Ladies you need to help out your man
Instead of frontin' at the club with a drink in your hand
The Black family is now prehistoric
And we don't need psychic healing from Dionne Warwick
We all need to be down on our knees beggin' please
Lord help us shake this disease
And MC's don't take these rhymes for no joke
Craig Mack pen is mightier than the sword
You stroke
So take heed to the words that I send
Cause on Judgement Day everey man must attend
Chorus

All our Black leaders are throwing on they war paint
I ain't seen a saint that might make me faint
How long can we sing that song
Knowing that the shit ya kicking brother is dead wrong
And don't figure Mack new to get started
Cause flip out an old fat verse from get retarded
I'm talking from veteran chair prepare
MC's nightmare only there's no need to fear
Shape up ya Lord about to strike
With thunder claps that turn day into night
With something similar to Gabriel's horn
The first flag up my tribe of Judah's now been warn
Peace to Bad Boy for bring me here
People of the world presenting Mack this year
No need for fronting his time has almost came
And the last rhyme ya hear bears Craig Mack's name

Took and x-ray, turns out my body is hollow

There's nothing inside
So I question why I'm alive
You would think I would have died
Now I need a place to hide
I don't even know how I got here in the first place
This is fucked up if this is really my fate
Imma grab my things and head back to my place
I guess this the vengeance of everything that I hate
My back fucking hurts but I ain't that old yet
If I die young there is no need to be upset
Made it to sixteen, surprised I ain't yet
Take an x-ray just see if anything's left

Subdued in silence, pierced by dawning light

Forever timeless
Turning thoughts within
Subtle words of wisdom
Echo once again

Trapped in stagnation
Hours of the day
Walking close to death
Night will show the way

End this dream
Show us what is real
Is this the dusk or the dawn?

Tell me the story
Of the sun and the moon
Why shadows die
When light hits the room
Why fear turns away
And dies wide awake
It suffers, decays
Truth is pain
The light that lets you see
Day is what the night will never be

Endless

Night, once shapeless, strong
Weak, now defined
Promise of serenity
Illusion of the mind

Silent chaos
Predation of the stars
Expanding
Contracting now

Forever, timeless
Turning thoughts within
These words of wisdom
Echo once again

These standing hours
Now broken by the light
A path less traveled
Guided by the night
End this dream
Show me what is real
Bring back the ending
Darkness makes me feel

Tell me why
The soul craves the rain
When will the fear
Come back again?
Tell me when
The suffering begins
Tell me when these words betray

Hear the ringing
Warning of the day
This nocturnal heart will never see"

I thought we loved this life
Did I imagine
The days we felt alive
It’s force of habit
When I leave you behind
So don’t you dare think that I’m far too good for you

I’m feeling distant
Like you don’t want me there
I stay persistent
But I’m not unaware
Of all the difference
Or how you seem to care
But I may be a bit paranoid that you no longer feel any joy

Or not the kind that comes from me
At least in each other’s company
Or not the kind that comes from me
And I don’t think it bears repeating but I’m sorry that I feel anything
I know you hate me
There’s no more room to hide
The backhand blaming
You won’t apologize
You haven’t lately
But I’m not that surprised
Because both of us are right but I don’t know if we’ll see either side

I hate the disconnect
You won’t find true love here
I’d rather die than disappear
You hate this breakneck
Pace that we’ve been moving in
I’ll move again push you from me
I’ll move again push you from me

I’ve got this pain in my side
Telling me that no one else feels how I do
And all the words that I write
Are just a sad attempt to get close to you
I know I’ve fallen behind
And the only one to push me is myself
So I’ll take a plane to Jersey cause
I don’t need any help"

It's a serious game when you got to start from the bottom again

You never saw beyond your own 4 walls it's a shame you never saw the light

Spending the day, feeling alright
When it go dark, mixing the sprite (feeling alright)

And how you been making me blue
My feelings been all in a queue
Difference in lies and the truth
So, you decide what imma be?
Should I be rapping or go in a league?
Cause I cannot think of a thing
The school has been making me weak
But I love you, put me in places
Feeling of roaming in Vegas
You make me feel so famous

You told me fuck up the industry
I’m getting ready and being so focused
A hundred mil, nothing for less

And make me a highness

Giving illusions of private
Making me safe from the virus
Making me feel like a pilot

It would be more that I could stand

Oh, baby

Maybe I've been too hung up on myself
But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf
Cause that's more than I could stand

Why you wanna leave me?
Why you wanna go?
I promise not
To never, never hurt you no more

Oh, please don't leave me

2570,"When Thomas came he made the promise to behave
The promise to behave, the promise to behave, the promise to behave
The time is near, he said, but he promised to behave
He promised to behave, he promised to behave

My daddy said never trust the darkness in those eyes
All logic said he’s a vampire in a neat disguise
But baby baby I didn’t care if those sweet lips just told me lies
Those hands they traced much too good across my back
I walked the walkaway walk right back into his arms

When Thomas came he made the promise to behave
The promise to behave, the promise to behave, the promise to behave
The time is near, he said, but he promised to behave
He promised to behave, he promised to behave

I had an honest man that Tommy blew out of my head
Then did my own blowing in a library somewhere
I bit his Adam’s apple and that’s a double entendre
Against a cold mirror wall he taught me how to beg
I walked the walkaway walk right back into his bed
Enticing and arousing despair, he lured me into his net
Nasty, brutal, cruel man broke every rule I made
Mean cold-blooded thing got naked in a dangerous way
And talked of love and fate

I can’t see the sun now my baby’s gone
I can’t take the time to make it on my own
I can’t I can’t shake the need to hear
His knock knocking on my door
´Cause when Thomas left
The world it just went absolutely cold
So cold

When Tomas came he made the promise to behave (break, break, break, break)
The promise to behave (break, break, break, break)
The promise to behave"

That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate

This world is insanity

No Human can bear this delirious torture, there's no fucking end

Roaming in the dark
Tunnel with no light at the end
Destroyed, piecе by piece
Corrupting your mind until its pitch black

What can you see and what you can't
Therе is no difference between heaven and hell
You don't know what is waiting on the other side of your corrupted mind
Banished, tortured, disgraced by thy sins

Cracking the surface between the two worlds of divine

This ain't no time of year to be alone

He said 'you look like hell, boy where's your better half?'
I said 'she's gone and I don't think she's coming back
Did she have some last minute shopping that just couldn't be postponed?'
This ain't no time of year to be alone

I got just one wish
On my Christmas list
Oh baby how I wish you were here
I want chestnuts roastin', good friends toastin'
Health and happiness
But it won't mean a thing without you dear

He said 'Christmas without love and tenderness
That's just a hollow holiday at best
Son, it takes two to tango underneath that mistletoe'
This ain't no time of year to be alone
I got just one wish
On my Christmas list
I'd give anything to have you here with me
I want yule logs, reindeer, egg nogg, good cheer
Five golden rings

Good and Evil, Good and Bad

—These English psychologists whom we have to thank for the only attempts up to this point to produce a history of the origins of morality —in themselves they serve up to us no small riddle. By way of a living riddle, they even offer, I confess, something substantially more than their books—they are interesting in themselves! These English psychologists—what do they really want? We find them, willingly or unwillingly, always at the same work, that is, hauling the partie honteuse [shameful part]of our inner world into the foreground, in order to look right there for the truly effective and operative factor which has determined our development, the very place where man’s intellectual pride least wishes to find it (for example, in the vis inertiae [force of inertia] of habit or in forgetfulness or in a blind, contingent, mechanical joining of ideas or in something else purely passive, automatic, reflex, molecular, and fundamentally stupid)—what is it that really drives these psychologists always in this particular direction? Is it a secret, malicious, common instinct, perhaps one which cannot be acknowledged even to itself, for belittling humanity? Or something like a pessimistic suspicion, the mistrust of idealists who’ve become disappointed, gloomy, venomous, and green? Or a small underground hostility and rancour towards Christianity (and Plato), which perhaps has never once managed to cross the threshold of consciousness? Or even a lecherous taste for what is odd or painfully paradoxical, for what in existence is questionable and ridiculous? Or finally—a bit of all of these: a little vulgarity, a little gloominess, a little hostility to Christianity, a little thrill, and a need for pepper? . . . But I’m told that these men are simply old, cold, boring frogs,who creep and hop around and into people as if they were in their own proper element, that is, in a swamp. I resist that idea when I hear it. What’s more, I don’t believe it. And if one is permitted to hope where one cannot know, then I hope from my heart that the situation with these men might be reversed, that these investigators and the ones peering at the soul through their microscopes may be thoroughly brave, generous, and proud animals, who know how to control their hearts and their pain and who at the same time have educated themselves to sacrifice everything desirable for the sake of the truth, for the sake of every truth, even the simple, bitter, hateful, repellent, unchristian, immoral truth. . . . For there are such truths. —

So all respect to the good spirits that may govern in these historians of morality! But it’s certainly a pity that they lack the historical spirit itself, that they’ve been left in the lurch by all the good spirits of history! As a group they all think essentially unhistorically, in what is now the traditional manner of philosophers. Of that there is no doubt. The incompetence of their genealogies of morals reveals itself at the very beginning, where the issue is to determine the origin of the idea and of the judgment “good.” “People,” so they proclaim, “originally praised unegoistic actions and called them good from the perspective of those for whom they were done, that is, those for whom such actions were useful. Later people forgot how this praise began, and because unegoistic actions had, according to custom, always been praised as good, people then felt them as good—as if they were something inherently good.” We perceive right away that this initial derivation already contains all the typical characteristics of the idiosyncrasies of English psychologists—we have “usefulness,” “forgetting,” “habit,” and finally “error,” all as the foundation for an evaluation in which the higher man up to this time has taken pride, as if it were a sort of privilege of men generally. This pride is to be humbled, this evaluation of worth emptied of value. Has that been achieved? . . .  Now, first of all, it’s obvious to me that from this theory the essential focus for the origin of the idea “good” has been sought for and established in the wrong place: the judgment “good” did not move here from those to whom “goodness” was shown! On the contrary, it was the “good people” themselves, that is, the noble, powerful, higher-ranking, and higher-thinking people who felt and set themselves and their actions up as good, that is to say, of the first rank, in opposition to everything low, low-minded, common, and vulgar. From this pathos of distance they first arrogated to themselves the right to create values, to stamp out the names for values. What did they care about usefulness! Particularly in relation to such a hot pouring out of the highest rank-ordering, rank-setting judgments of value, the point of view which considers utility is as foreign and inappropriate as possible. Here the feeling has reached the very opposite of that low level of warmth which is a condition for that calculating shrewdness, that reckoning  by utility—and not just for a moment, not for an exceptional hour, but permanently. The pathos of nobility and distance, as mentioned, the lasting and domineering feeling, something total and fundamental, of a higher ruling nature in relation to a lower type, to a “beneath”—that is the origin of the opposition between “good” and “bad.” (The right of the master to give names extends so far that we could permit ourselves to grasp the origin of language itself as an expression of the power of the rulers: they say “that is such and such”; they seal every object and event with a sound, and in the process, as it were, take possession of it.) Given this origin, the word “good” is from the start in no way necessarily tied up with “unegoistic” actions, as it is in the superstition of those genealogists of morality. Rather, that occurs for the first time with the collapse of aristocratic value judgments, when this entire contrast between “egoistic” and “unegoistic” pressed itself ever more strongly into human awareness—it is, to use my own words, the instinct of the herd which, through this contrast, finally gets its word (and its words). And even then, it still takes a long time until this instinct in the masses becomes master, with the result that moral evaluation gets thoroughly hung up and bogged down on this opposition (as is the case, for example, in modern Europe: today the prejudice that takes “moralistic,” “unegoistic,” and “désintéressé” [disinterested]as equally valuable ideas already governs, with the force of a “fixed idea” and a disease of the brain).
3
Secondly, however, and quite separate from the fact that this hypothesis about the origin of the value judgment “good” is historically untenable, it suffers from an inherent psychological contradiction. The utility of the unegoistic action is supposed to be the origin of the praise it receives, and this origin has allegedly been forgotten:—but how is this forgetting even possible? Could the usefulness of such actions at some time or other perhaps just have stopped? The opposite is the case: this utility has rather been an everyday experience throughout the ages, and thus something that has always been constantly re-emphasized. Hence, instead of disappearing from consciousness, instead of becoming something forgettable, it must have pressed itself into the consciousness with ever-increasing clarity. How much more sensible is that contrasting theory (which is not therefore closer to the truth—) which is advocated, for example, by Herbert Spencer: he proposes that the idea “good” is essentially the same as the idea “useful” or “functional,” so that in judgments about “good” and “bad” human beings sum up and endorse the experiences they have not forgotten and cannot forget concerning the useful-functional and the harmful-useless.* According to this theory, good is something which has always proved useful, so that it may assert its validity as “valuable in the highest degree,” as “valuable in itself.” This path to an explanation is, as mentioned, also false, but at least the account is inherently sensible and psychologically tenable.

I was given a hint of the right direction by the question: What, from an etymological perspective, do the meanings of “Good” as manifested in different languages really mean? There I found that all of them lead back to the same transformation of ideas—that everywhere “noble” and “aristocratic” in a social sense is the fundamental idea out of which “good” in the sense of “spiritually noble,” “aristocratic,” “spiritually high-minded,” “spiritually privileged” necessarily develops, a process which always runs in parallel with that other one which finally transforms “common,” “vulgar,” and “low” into the concept “bad.” The most eloquent example of the latter is the German word “schlect”[bad] itself, which is identical with the word “schlicht” [plain]—compare “schlectweg”[simply] and “schlechterdings” [simply]—and which originally designated the plain, common man, still without any suspicious side glance, simply in contrast to the noble man. Around the time of the Thirty Years War approximately, hence late enough, this sense changed into the one used now.[1618-1648]* As far as the genealogy of morals is concerned, this point strikes me as a fundamental insight; that it was first discovered so late we can ascribe to the repressive influence which democratic prejudice in the modern world exercises concerning all questions of origin. And this occurs in what appears to be the most objective realm of natural science and physiology, a point which I can only hint at here. But the sort of mischief this prejudice can cause, once it has become unleashed as hatred, particularly where morality and history are concerned, is revealed in the well-known case of Buckle: the plebeian nature of the modern spirit, which originated in England, broke out once again on its home turf, as violently as a muddy volcano and with that salty, over-loud, and common eloquence with which all previous volcanoes have spoken.—*
5
With respect to our problem—which for good reasons we can call a quiet problem, which addresses in a refined manner only a few ears,— there is no little interest in establishing the point that often in those words and roots which designate “good” there still shines through the main nuance of what made the nobility feel they were men of higher rank. It’s true that in most cases they perhaps named themselves simply after their superiority in power (as “the powerful,” “the masters,” “those in command”) or after the most visible sign of their superiority, for example, as “the rich” or “the owners” (that is the meaning of arya [noble], and the corresponding words in Iranian and Slavic).But they also named themselves after a typical characteristic, and that is the case which is our concern here.  For instance, they called themselves “the truthful,” above all the Greek nobility, whose mouthpiece is the Megarian poet Theogonis.* The word developed for this characteristic, esthlos[fine, noble] , indicates, according to its root meaning, a man who is, who possesses reality, who really exists, who is true. Then, with a subjective transformation, it indicates the true man as the truthful man. In this phase of conceptual transformation it became the slogan and catch phrase for the nobility, and its sense shifted entirely over to “aristocratic,” to mark a distinction from the lying common man, as Theogonis takes and presents him—until finally, after the decline of the nobility, the word remains as a designation of spiritual nobility and becomes, as it were, ripe and sweet. In the word kakos [weak, worthless], as in the word deilos [cowardly] (the plebeian in contrast to the agathos [good] man), the cowardice is emphasized. This perhaps provides a hint about the direction in which we have to seek the etymological origin for the multiple meanings of agathos. In the Latin word malus [bad] (which I place alongside melas [black, dark]) the common man could be designated as the dark-coloured, above all as the dark-haired (“hic niger est” [“this man is dark”]), as the pre-Aryan inhabitant of Italian soil, who stood out from those who became dominant, the blonds, that is, the conquering race of Aryans, most clearly through this colour. At any rate, Gaelic offers me an exactly corresponding example—the word fin (for example, in the name Fin-Gal), the term designating nobility and finally the good, noble, and pure, originally referred to the blond-headed man in contrast to the dusky, dark-haired original inhabitants. Incidentally, the Celts were a thoroughly blond race. People are wrong when they link those traces of a basically dark-haired population, which are noticeable on the carefully prepared ethnographic maps of Germany, with any Celtic origin and mixing of blood, as Virchow still does.* It is much rather the case that in these places the pre-Aryan population of Germany predominates. (The same is true for almost all of Europe: essentially the conquered races finally attained the upper hand for themselves once again in colour, shortness of skull, perhaps even in the intellectual and social instincts. Who can confirm for us whether modern democracy, the even more modern anarchism, and indeed that preference for the “Commune,” for the most primitive form of society, which all European socialists now share, does not indicate for the most part a monstrous counterattack— and that the ruling and master race, the Aryans, is not being defeated, even physiologically?). The Latin word bonus [good] I believe I can explicate as “the warrior,” provided that I am correct in tracing bonus back to an older word duonus (compare bellum [war] = duellum [war] = duen-lum, which seems to me to contain that word duonus). Hence, bonus as a man of war, of division (duo), as a warrior. We see what constituted a man’s “goodness” in ancient Rome. What about our German word “Gut” [good] itself? Doesn’t it indicate “den Göttlichen” [the god-like man], the man of “göttlichen Geschlechts” [“the generation of gods]”? And isn’t that identical to the people’s (originally the nobles’) name for the Goths? The reasons for this hypothesis do not belong here.—
6
To this rule that the concept of political superiority always resolves itself into the concept of spiritual superiority, it is not really an exception (although there is room for exceptions), when the highest caste is also the priestly caste and consequently for its total range of meanings prefers a rating which recalls its priestly function. So, for example, for the first time the words “pure” and “impure” appear as contrasting marks of one’s social position, and later a “good” and a “bad” also develop with a meaning which no longer refers to social position. Incidentally, people should be warned not to begin by taking these ideas of “pure” and “impure” too seriously, too broadly, or even symbolically. Instead they should understand from the start that all the ideas of ancient humanity, to a degree we can hardly imagine, are much more coarse, crude, superficial, narrow, blunt and, in particular, unsymbolic. The “pure man” is initially simply a man who washes himself, who forbids himself certain foods which produce diseases of the skin, who doesn’t sleep with the dirty women of the lower people, who has a horror of blood—no more, not much more! On the other hand, of course, from the very nature of an essentially priestly aristocracy it is clear enough how it’s precisely here that early on the opposition between different evaluations could become dangerously internalized and sharpened. And, in fact, they finally ripped open fissures between man and man, over which even an Achilles of the free spirit could not cross without shivering.* From the beginning there is something unhealthy about such priestly aristocracies and about the customary attitudes which govern in them, which turn away from action, sometimes brooding, sometimes exploding with emotion, as a result of which in the priests of almost all ages there have appeared almost unavoidably those debilitating intestinal illnesses and neurasthenia. But what they themselves came up with as a remedy for this pathological disease—surely we can assert that it has finally shown itself, through its effects, as even a hundred times more dangerous than the illness for which it was to provide relief. Human beings themselves are still sick from the after-effects of this priestly naivetein healing! Let’s think, for example, of certain forms of diet (avoiding meat), of fasting, of celibacy, of the flight “into the desert” (Weir-Mitchell’s isolation, but naturally without the fattening up cure and overeating which follow it, which constitutes the most effective treatment for all hysteria induced by the ascetic ideal)*: consider also the whole metaphysic of the priests, so hostile to the senses, making men lazy and sophisticated, the way they hypnotize themselves in the manner of fakirs and Brahmins—Brahmanism employed as a glass knob and a fixed idea—and finally the only too understandable and common dissatisfaction with its radical cure, with nothingness (or God—the desire for a uniomystica [mystical union] with God is the desire of the Buddhist for nothingness, nirvana—and nothing more!). Among the priests, everything simply becomes more dangerous—not only the remedies and arts of healing, but also pride, vengeance, mental acuity, excess, love, thirst for power, virtue, illness—although it’s fair enough also to add that on the foundation of this fundamentally dangerous form of human existence, the priestly, for the first time the human being became, in general, an interesting animal, that here the human soul first attained depth in a higher sense and became evil—and, indeed, these are the two basic reasons for humanity’s superiority, up to now, over other animals! . . .

You will have already guessed how easily the priestly way of evaluating can split from the knightly-aristocratic and then continue to develop into its opposite. Such a development receives a special stimulus every time the priestly caste and the warrior caste confront each other jealously and are not willing to agree amongst themselves about the winner. The knightly-aristocratic judgments of value have as their basic assumption a powerful physicality, a blooming, rich, even overflowing health, together with those things required to maintain these qualities—war, adventure, hunting, dancing, war games, and, in general, everything which involves strong, free, happy action. The priestly-noble method of evaluating has, as we saw, other preconditions: these make it difficult enough for them when it comes to war! As is well known, priests are the most evil of enemies—but why? Because they are the most powerless. From their powerlessness, their hate grows among them into something huge and terrifying, to the most spiritual and most poisonous manifestations. The really great haters in world history and the most spiritual haters have always been priests—in comparison with the spirit of priestly revenge all the remaining spirits are generally hardly worth considering. Human history would be a really stupid affair without that spirit which entered it from the powerless. Let us quickly consider the greatest example. Everything on earth which has been done against “the nobility,” “the powerful,” “the masters,” “the possessors of power” is not worth mentioning in comparison with what the Jews have done against them: the Jews, that priestly people, who knew how to get final satisfaction from their enemies and conquerors through a radical transformation of their values, that is, through an act of the most spiritual revenge. This was appropriate only to a priestly people with the most deeply repressed priestly desire for revenge. In opposition to the aristocratic value equations (good = noble = powerful = beautiful = fortunate = loved by god), the Jews, with a consistency inspiring fear, dared to reverse things and to hang on to that with the teeth of the most profound hatred (the hatred of the powerless), that is, to “only those who suffer are good; the poor, the powerless, the low are the only good people; the suffering, those in need, the sick, the ugly are also the only pious people; only they are blessed by God; for them alone there is salvation.—By contrast, you privileged and powerful people, you are for all eternity the evil, the cruel, the lecherous, the insatiable, the godless; you will also be the unblessed, the cursed, and the damned for all eternity!” . . . We know who inherited this Judaic transformation of values . . . In connection with that huge and immeasurably disastrous initiative which the Jews launched with this most fundamental of all declarations of war, I recall the sentence I wrote at another time (in Beyond Good and Evil, section 195)—namely, that with the Jews the slave rebellion in morality begins: that rebellion which has a two-thousand-year-old history behind it and which we nowadays no longer notice because it—has triumphed. . . .*
8
But you fail to understand that? You have no eye for something that needed two millennia to emerge victorious? . . . That’s nothing to wonder at: all lengthy things are hard to see, to assess. However,that’s what took place: out of the trunk of that tree of vengeance and hatred, Jewish hatred—the deepest and most sublime hatred, that is, a hatred which creates ideals and transforms values, something whose like has never existed on earth—from that grew something just as incomparable, a new love, the deepest and most sublime of all the forms of love: —from what other trunk could it have grown? . . . However, one should not assume that this love arose essentially as the denial of that thirst for vengeance, as the opposite of Jewish hatred! No. The reverse is the truth! This love grew out of that hatred, as its crown, as the victorious crown unfolding itself wider and wider in the purest brightness and sunshine, which, so to speak, was seeking for the kingdom of light and height, the goal of that hate, aiming for victory, trophies, seduction, with the same urgency with which the roots of that hatred were sinking down ever deeper and more greedily into everything that was evil and possessed depth. This Jesus of Nazareth, the living evangelist of love, the “Saviour” bringing holiness and victory to the poor, to the sick, to the sinners—was he not that very seduction in its most terrible and most irresistible form, the seduction and detour to exactly those Judaic values and innovations in ideals? Didn’t Israel attain, precisely with the detour of this “Saviour,” of this apparent enemy to and dissolver of Israel, the final goal of its sublime thirst for vengeance? Isn’t it part of the secret black art of a truly great politics of vengeance, a farsighted, underground, slowly expropriating, and premeditated revenge, that Israel itself had to disown and nail to the cross, like some mortal enemy, the tool essential to its revenge before all the world, so that “all the world,” that is, all Israel’s enemies, could then swallow this particular bait without a second thought? On the other hand, could anyone, using the full subtlety of his mind, even imagine in general a more dangerous bait? Something to match the enticing, intoxicating, narcotizing, corrupting power of that symbol of the “holy cross,” that ghastly paradox of a “god on the cross,” that mystery of an unimaginable and ultimate final cruelty and self-crucifixion of god for the salvation of mankind? . . . At least it is certain that sub hoc signo [under this sign] Israel, with its vengeance and revaluation of the worth of all other previous values, has triumphed again and again over all other ideals, over all nobler ideals.
9
—”But what are you doing still talking about more noble ideals! Let’s look at the facts: the people have triumphed—or ‘the slaves,’ or ‘the rabble,’ or ‘the herd,’ or whatever you want to call them—if this has taken place because of the Jews, then good for them! No people ever had a more world-historical mission. ‘The masters’ have been disposed of. The morality of the common man has won. We may also take this victory as a blood poisoning (it did mix the races up together)—I don’t deny that. But this intoxication has undoubtedly been successful. The ‘Salvation’ of the human race (namely, from ‘the masters’) is well under way. Everything is visibly turning Jewish or Christian or plebeian (what do the words matter!). The progress of this poison through the entire body of humanity seems irresistible, although its tempo and pace may seem from now on constantly slower, more delicate, less audible, more circumspect—well, we have time enough. . . From this point of view, does the church today still have necessary work to do, does it generally still have a right to exist? Or could we dispense with it? Quaeritur [That’s a question to be asked]. It seems that it rather obstructs and hinders the progress of that poison, instead of speeding it up? Well, that just might be what makes the church useful . . . Certainly the church is something positively gross and vulgar, which a more delicate intelligence, a truly modern taste, resists. Shouldn’t the church at least be something more sophisticated? . . . Today the church alienates more than it seduces. . . . Who among us would really be a free spirit if the church were not there? The church repels us, not its poison. . . . Apart from the church, we even love the poison. . . .”— This is the epilogue of a “free thinker” to my speech, an honest animal, as he has richly revealed, and in addition he’s a democrat. He listened to me up to this point and couldn’t bear to hear my silence—since for me at this juncture there is much to be silent about.

The slave revolt in morality begins when the ressentiment itself becomes creative and gives birth to values: the ressentiment of those beings who are prevented from a genuine reaction, that is, something active, and who compensate for that with a merely imaginary vengeance.* While all noble morality grows out of a triumphant affirmation of one’s own self, slave morality from the start says “No” to what is “outside,” “other,” to “a not itself.” And this “No” is its creative act. This transformation of the glance which confers value—this necessary projection towards what is outer instead of back onto itself—that is inherent in ressentiment. In order to arise, slave morality always requires first an opposing world, a world outside itself. Psychologically speaking, it needs external stimuli in order to act at all—its action is basically reaction. The reverse is the case with the noble method of valuing: it acts and grows spontaneously. It seeks its opposite only to affirm its own self even more thankfully, with even more rejoicing— its negative concept of “low,” “common,” “bad” is merely a pale contrasting image after the fact in relation to its positive basic concept, thoroughly intoxicated with life and passion, “We are noble, good, beautiful, and happy!” When the noble way of evaluating makes a mistake and abuses reality, this happens with reference to the sphere which it does not know well enough, indeed, the sphere it has strongly resisted learning the truth about: under certain circumstances it misjudges the sphere it despises, the sphere of the common man, of the low people. On the other hand, we should consider that even assuming that the feeling of contempt, of looking down, or of looking superior falsifies the image of the person despised, such distortions will fall short by a long way of the distortion with which the suppressed hatred, the vengeance of the powerless man, assaults his opponent—naturally, in effigy. In fact, in contempt there is too much negligence, too much dismissiveness, too much looking away and impatience, all mixed together, even too much of a characteristic feeling of joy, for it to be capable of converting its object into a truly distorted image and monster. For example, we should not fail to hear the almost benevolent nuances which for a Greek noble lay in all the words with which he set himself above the lower people—how a constant form of pity, consideration, and forbearance is mixed in there, sweetening the words, to the point where almost all words which refer to the common man finally remain as expressions for “unhappy,” “worthy of pity” (compare deilos [cowardly], deilaios [lowly, mean], poneros [oppressed by toil, wretched], mochtheros [suffering, wretched]—the last two basically designating the common man as a slave worker and beast of burden)—and how, on the other hand, for the Greek ear the words “bad,” “low,” “unhappy” have never stopped echoing a single note, one tone colour, in which “unhappy” predominates. This is the inheritance of the old, noble, aristocratic way of evaluating, which does not betray its principles even in contempt. (—Philologists should recall the sense in which oizuros [miserable], anolbos [unblessed], tlemon[wretched], dystychein [unfortunate], xymfora [misfortune] were used). The “well born” simply felt that they were “the happy ones”; they did not have to construct their happiness artificially first by looking at their enemies, or in some circumstance to talk themselves into it, to lie to themselves (the way all men of ressentiment habitually do). Similarly they knew, as complete men, overloaded with power and thus necessarily active, that they must not separate action from happiness—they considered being active necessarily associated with happiness (that’s where the phrase eu prattein[do well, succeed] derives its origin)—all this is very much the opposite of “happiness” at the level of the powerless, the oppressed, those festering with poisonous and hostile feelings, among whom happiness comes out essentially as a narcotic, an anaesthetic, quiet, peace, “Sabbath,” relaxing the soul, and stretching one’s limbs, in short, as something passive. While the noble man lives for himself with trust and candour (gennaios, meaning “of noble birth,” stresses the nuance “upright” and also probably “naive”), the man of ressentiment is neither upright nor naive, nor honest and direct with himself. His soul squints. His spirit loves hiding places, secret paths, and back doors. Everything furtive attracts him as his world, his security, his refreshment. He understands about remaining silent, not forgetting, waiting, temporarily diminishing himself, humiliating himself. A race of such men of ressentiment will necessarily end up cleverer than any noble race. It will value cleverness to a completely different extent, that is, as a condition of existence of the utmost importance; whereas, cleverness among noble men easily acquires a delicate aftertaste of luxury and sophistication about it:—here it is simply less important than the complete functional certainty of the ruling unconscious instincts or even a certain lack of cleverness, something like brave recklessness, whether in the face of danger or of an enemy, or those wildly enthusiastic, sudden fits of anger, love, reverence, thankfulness, and vengeance, by which in all ages noble souls have recognized each other. The ressentiment of the noble man himself, if it comes over him, consumes and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction and therefore does not poison. On the other hand, in countless cases it just does not appear at all; whereas, in the case of all weak and powerless people it is unavoidable. Being unable to take one’s enemies, one’s misfortunes, even one’s bad deeds seriously for very long—that is the mark of strong, complete natures, in whom there is a surplus of plastic, creative, healing power, as well as the power to forget (a good example for that from the modern world is Mirabeau, who had no memory of insults and maliciousness people directed at him, and who therefore could not forgive, merely because he—forgot).* Such a man with a single shrug simply throws off himself the many worms which eat into other men. Only here is possible—provided that it is at all possible on earth—the real “love for one’s enemy.” How much respect a noble man already has for his enemies!—and such a respect is already a bridge to love. . . . In fact, he demands his enemy for himself, as his mark of honour. Indeed, he has no enemy other than one in whom there is nothing to despise and a great deal to respect! By contrast, imagine for yourself “the enemy” as a man of ressentiment conceives him—and right here we have his action, his creation: he has conceptualized “the evil enemy,” “the evil one,” and as a fundamental idea, from which he now also thinks his way to an opposite image and counterpart, a “good man”— himself! . . .
11
We see exactly the opposite with the noble man, who conceives the fundamental idea “good” in advance and spontaneously, that is, from himself and from there first creates a picture of “bad” for himself! This “bad” originating from the noble man and that “evil” arising out of the stew pot of insatiable hatred—of these the first is a later creation, an afterthought, a complementary colour; by contrast, the second is the original, the beginning, the essential act of conception in slave morality—although the two words “bad” and “evil” both seem opposite to the same idea of “good,” how different they are! But it is not the same idea of “good”; it is much rather a question of who the “evil man” really is, in the sense of the morality of ressentiment. The strict answer to that is as follows: simply the “good man” of the other morality, the noble man, the powerful, the ruling man, only coloured over, only reinterpreted, only seen through the poisonous eyes of ressentiment. Here there is one thing we will be the last to deny: the man who gets to know these “good men” only as enemies, knows them also as nothing but evil enemies, and the same good men who are kept within strict limits by custom, honour, habit, thankfulness, even more by mutual protection, through jealousy inter pares [among equals] and who, by contrast, demonstrate in relation to each other such resourceful consideration, self-control, refinement, loyalty, pride, and friendship—towards the outside, where the strange world, the world of foreigners, begins, these men are not much better than beasts of prey turned loose. There they enjoy freedom from all social constraints. In the wilderness they make up for the tension which a long fenced-in confinement within the peace of the community brings about. They go back to the innocent consciousness of a wild beast of prey, as joyful monsters, who perhaps walk away from a dreadful sequence of murder, arson, rape, and torture with an exhilaration and spiritual equilibrium, as if they had merely pulled off a student prank, convinced that the poets now once again have something to sing about and praise for a long time to come. At the bottom of all these noble races we cannot fail to recognize the beast of prey, the blond beast splendidly roaming around in its lust for loot and victory. This hidden basis from time to time needs to be discharged: the animal must come out again, must go back into the wilderness,—Roman, Arab, German, Japanese nobility, Homeric heroes, Scandinavian Vikings—in this need they are all alike.  It is the noble races which left behind the concept of the “barbarian” in all their tracks, wherever they went. A consciousness of and even a pride in this fact still reveals itself in their highest culture (for example, when Pericles says to his Athenians, in that famous Funeral Speech, “our audacity has broken a way through to every land and sea, putting up permanent memorials to itself for good and ill”). This “audacity” of the noble races, mad, absurd, sudden in the way it expresses itself, its unpredictability, even the improbability of its undertakings—Pericles emphatically praises the rayhumia [mental balance, freedom from anxiety] of the Athenians—their indifference to and contempt for safety, body, life, comfort, their fearsome cheerfulness and the depth of their joy in all destruction, in all the physical pleasures of victory and cruelty—everything summed up for those who suffer from such audacity in the image of the “barbarian,” of the “evil enemy,” of something like the “Goths” or the “Vandals.”* The deep, icy mistrust which the German evokes, as soon as he comes to power, once more again today—is always still an after-effect of that unforgettable terror with which for centuries Europe confronted the rage of the blond German beast (although there is hardly any idea linking the old Germanic tribes and we Germans, let alone any blood relationship). Once before I have remarked on Hesiod’s dilemma when he thought up his sequence of cultural periods and sought to express them as Gold, Silver, and Bronze.* But he didn’t know what to do with the contradiction presented to him by the marvellous but, at the same time, horrifying and violent world of Homer, other than to make two cultural ages out of one and then place one after the other—first the age of Heroes andDemi-gods from Troy and Thebes, just as that world remained in the memories of the noble families who had their own ancestors in it, and then the Bronze age as that same world appeared to the descendants of the downtrodden, exploited, ill treated, those carried off and sold—a Bronze age, as mentioned: hard, cold, cruel, empty of feeling and scruples, with everything crushed and covered over in blood. Assuming as true what in any event is taken as “the truth” nowadays, that it is the purpose of all culture simply to breed a tame and civilized animal, a domestic pet, out of the beast of prey “man,” then we would undoubtedly have to consider all those instincts of reaction and ressentiment with whose help the noble races and all their ideals were finally disgraced and overpowered as the essential instruments of culture—though to do that would not be to claim that the bearers of these instincts also in themselves represented culture. By contrast, the opposite would not only be probable—no! nowadays it is visibly apparent! These people carrying instincts of oppression and of a lust for revenge, the descendants of all European and non-European slavery, of all pre-Aryan populations in particular—they represent the regression of mankind! These “instruments of culture” are a disgrace to humanity, and more a reason to be suspicious of or a counterargument against “culture” in general! We may well be right when we hang onto our fear of the blond beast at the base of all noble races and keep up our guard. But who would not find it a hundred times better to fear if he could at the same time be allowed to admire, rather than not fear but in the process no longer be able to rid himself of the disgusting sight of the failures, the stunted, the emaciated, the poisoned? Is not that our fate? Today what is it that constitutes our aversion to “man”?—For we suffer from man. There’s no doubt of that. It’s not a matter of fear. Rather it’s the fact that we have nothing more to fear from man, that the maggot “man” is in the foreground swarming around, that the “tame man,” the hopelessly mediocre and unpleasant man, has already learned to feel that he is the goal, the pinnacle, the meaning of history, “the higher man,”—yes indeed, that he even has a certain right to feel that about himself, insofar as he feels separate from the excess of failed, sick, tired, spent people, who are nowadays beginning to make Europe stink, so that he feels at least relatively successful, at least still capable of life, of at least saying “Yes” to life.
12
—At this point I won’t suppress a sigh and a final confidence. What is it exactly that I find so totally unbearable? Something which I cannot deal with on my own, which makes me choke and feel faint? Bad air! Bad air! It’s when something which has failed comes close to me, when I have to smell the entrails of a failed soul! . . . Apart from that what can we not endure by way of need, deprivation, bad weather, infirmity, hardship, loneliness? Basically we can deal with all the other things, born as we are to an underground and struggling existence. We come back again and again into the light, we live over and over our golden hour of victory—and then we stand there, just as we were born, unbreakable, tense, ready for something new, for something even more difficult, more distant, like a bow which all troubles only serve always to pull still tighter. But if there are heavenly goddesses who are our patrons, beyond good and evil, then from time to time grant me a glimpse, just grant me a single glimpse into something perfect, something completely developed, happy, powerful, triumphant, from which there is still something to fear! A glimpse of a man who justifies humanity, of a complementary and redeeming stroke-of-luck of a man, for whose sake we can hang onto a faith in humanity! . . .  For matters stand like this: the diminution and levelling of European man conceal our greatest danger, for at the sight of him we grow tired . . . We see nothing today which wants to be greater. We suspect that things are constantly still going down, down into something thinner, more good-natured, more prudent, more comfortable, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more Christian—humanity, there is no doubt, is becoming constantly “better.” . . .  Europe’s fate lies right here—with the fear of man we also have lost the love for him, the reverence for him, the hope for him, indeed, our will to him. A glimpse at man nowadays makes us tired—what is contemporary nihilism, if it is not that? . . .We are weary of man. . . .
13
—But let’s come back: the problem with the other origin of the “good,” of the good man, as the person of ressentiment has imagined it for himself, demands its own conclusion.—That the lambs are upset about the great predatory birds is not a strange thing, and the fact that they snatch away small lambs provides no reason for holding anything against these large birds of prey. And if the lambs say among themselves, “These predatory birds are evil, and whoever is least like a predatory bird, especially anyone who is like its opposite, a lamb— shouldn’t that animal be good?” there is nothing to find fault with in this setting up of an ideal, except for the fact that the birds of prey might look down on them with a little mockery and perhaps say to themselves, “We are not at all annoyed with these good lambs. We even love them. Nothing is tastier than a tender lamb.” To demand from strength that it does not express itself as strength, that it does not consist of a will to overpower, a will to throw down, a will to rule, a thirst for enemies and opposition and triumph, is just as unreasonable as to demand from weakness that it express itself as strength. A quantum of force is simply such a quantum of drive, will, action—rather, it is nothing but this very driving, willing, acting itself—and it cannot appear as anything else except through the seduction of language (and the fundamental errors of reason petrified in it), which understands and misunderstands all action as conditioned by something which causes actions, by a “Subject.” For, in just the same way as people separate lightning from its flash and take the latter as an action, as the effect of a subject, which is called lightning, so popular morality separates strength from the manifestations of strength, as if behind the strong person there were an indifferent substrate, which is free to express strength or not. But there is no such substrate; there is no “being” behind the doing, acting, becoming. “The doer” is merely made up and added into the action—the act is everything. People basically duplicate the action: when they see a lightning flash, that is an action of an action: they set up the same event first as the cause and then yet again as its effect. Natural scientists are no better when they say “Force moves, force causes,” and so on—our entire scientific knowledge, for all its coolness, its freedom from feelings, still remains exposed to the seductions of language and has not gotten rid of the changelings foisted on it, the “Subjects” (the atom, for example, is such a changeling, like the Kantian “thing-in-itself”): it’s no wonder that the repressed, secretly smouldering feelings of rage and hate use this belief for themselves and basically even maintain a faith in nothing more fervently than in the idea that the strong are free to be weak and that predatory birds are free to be lambs:—in so doing, they arrogate to themselves the right to blame the birds of prey for being birds of prey. When the oppressed, the downtrodden, the conquered say to each other, with the vengeful cunning of the powerless, “Let us be different from evil people, namely, good! And that man is good who does not overpower, who hurts no one, who does not attack, who does not retaliate, who hands revenge over to God, who keeps himself hidden, as we do, the man who avoids all evil and demands little from life in general, like us, the patient, humble, and upright”—what that amounts to, coolly expressed and without bias, is essentially nothing more than “We weak people are merely weak. It’s good if we do nothing; we are not strong enough for that”—but this bitter state, this shrewdness of the lowest ranks, which even insects possess (when in great danger they stand as if they were dead in order not to do “too much”), has, thanks to that counterfeiting and self-deception of powerlessness, dressed itself in the splendour of a self-denying, still, patient virtue, just as if the weakness of the weak man himself—that means his essence, his actions, his entire single, inevitable, and irredeemable reality—is a voluntary achievement, something willed, chosen, an act, something of merit. This kind of man has to believe in the disinterested, freely choosing “subject” out of his instinct for self-preservation, self-approval, in which every falsehood is habitually sanctified. Hence, the subject (or, to use a more popular style, the soul) has up to now perhaps been the best principle for belief on earth, because, for the majority of the dying, the weak, and the downtrodden of all sorts, it makes possible that sublime self-deception which establishes weakness itself as freedom and their being like this or that as something meritorious.
14
Is there anyone who would like to take a little look down on and under that secret how man fabricates an ideal on earth? Who has the courage for that? . . . Come on, now! Here’s an open glimpse into this dark workshop. Just wait a moment, my dear Mr. Nosy and Presumptuous: your eye must first get used to this artificial flickering light. . . . So, enough! Now speak! What’s going on down there? Speak up. Say what you see, man of the most dangerous curiosity—now I’m the one who’s listening.—
—”I see nothing, but I hear all the more. It is a careful, crafty, light rumour-mongering and whispering from every nook and cranny. It seems to me that people are lying; a sugary mildness clings to every sound. Weakness is going to be falsified into something of merit. There’s no doubt about it—things are just as you said they were.”
—Keep talking!
—”And powerlessness which does not retaliate is being falsified into ‘goodness,’ anxious baseness into ‘humility,’ submission before those one hates to ‘obedience’ (of course, obedience to the one who, they say, commands this submission—they call him God). The inoffensiveness of the weak man—cowardice itself, in which he is rich, his standing at the door, his inevitable need to wait around—here acquires a good name, like ‘patience,’ and is called virtue itself. That incapacity for revenge is called the lack of desire for revenge, perhaps even forgiveness (‘for they know not what they do—only we know what they do!’). And people are talking about ‘love for one’s enemies’—and sweating as they say it.”
—Keep talking!
—”They are miserable—there’s no doubt about that—all these rumour-mongers and counterfeiters in the corners, although crouched down beside each other in the warmth—but they are telling me that their misery is God’s choice, His sign. One beats the dog one loves the most. Perhaps this misery may be a preparation, a test, an education, perhaps it is even more—something that will one day be rewarded and paid out with huge interest in gold, no, in happiness. They call that ‘blessedness’.”
—Go on!
—”Now they are letting me know that they are not only better than the powerful, the masters of the earth, whose spit they have to lick (not out of fear, certainly not out of fear, but because God commands that they honour all those in authority)—they are not only better than these, but they also are ‘better off,’ or at any rate will one day have it better. But enough! Enough! I can’t take it any more. Bad air! Bad air! This workshop where man fabricates ideals—it seems to me it stinks  of nothing but lies.”
—No! Just one minute more! So far you haven’t said anything about  the masterpiece of these black magicians who make whiteness, milk, and innocence out of every blackness:—have you not noticed the perfection of their sophistication, their most daring, most refined, most spiritual, most fallacious artistic attempt? Pay attention! These cellar animals full of vengeance and hatred—what exactly are they making out of that vengeance and hatred? Have you ever heard these words? If you heard only their words, would you suspect that you were completely among men of ressentiment? . . .
—”I understand. Once again I’ll open my ears (oh! oh! oh! and hold my nose). Now I’m hearing for the first time what they’ve been saying so often: ‘We good men—we are the righteous’—what they demand they don’t call repayment but ‘the triumph of righteousness.’ What they hate is not their enemy. No! They hate ‘injustice,’ ‘godlessness.’ What they believe and hope is not a hope for revenge, the intoxication of sweet vengeance (something Homer has already called ‘sweeter than honey’), but the victory of God, the righteous God, over the godless. What remains for them to love on earth is not their brothers in hatred but their ‘brothers in love,’ as they say, all the good and righteous people on the earth.”
—And what do they call what serves them as a consolation for all the suffering of life—their phantasmagoria of future blessedness which they are expecting?
—”What’s that? Am I hearing correctly? They call that ‘the last judgment,’ the coming of their kingdom, the coming of ‘God’s kingdom’— but in the meanwhile they live ‘in faith,’ ‘in love,’ ‘in hope.’”
—Enough! Enough!
15
In belief in what? In love with what? In hope for what?—There’s no doubt that these weak people—at some time or another they also want to be the strong people, some day their “kingdom” is to arrive—they call it simply “the kingdom of God,” as I mentioned. People are indeed so humble about everything! Only to experience that, one has to live a long time, beyond death—in fact, people must have an eternal life, so they can also win eternal recompense in the “kingdom of God” for that earthly life “in faith, in love, in hope.” Recompense for what? Recompense through what? . . . In my view, Dante was grossly in error when, with an ingenuity inspiring terror, he set that inscription over the gateway into his hell: “Eternal love also created me.”* Over the gateway into the Christian paradise and its “eternal blessedness” it would, in  any event, be more fitting to let the inscription stand “Eternal hate also created me”—provided it’s all right to set a truth over the gateway to a lie! For what is the bliss of that paradise? . . . Perhaps we might have guessed that already, but it is better for it to be expressly described for us by an authority we cannot underestimate in such matters, Thomas Aquinas, the great teacher and saint:  “In the kingdom of heaven” he says as gently as a lamb, “the blessed will see the punishment of the damned, so that they will derive all the more pleasure from their heavenly bliss.”* Or do you want to hear that message in a stronger tone, something from the mouth of a triumphant father of the church, who warns his Christians against the cruel sensuality of the public spectacles. But why? “Faith, in fact, offers much more to us,” he says (in de Spectaculis, c. 29 ff), “something much stronger. Thanks to the redemption, very different joys are ours to command; in place of the athletes, we have our martyrs. If we want blood, well, we have the blood of Christ . . . But what awaits us on the day of his coming again, his triumph!”—and now he takes off, the rapturous visionary:* “However there are other spectacles—that last eternal day of judgment, ignored by nations, derided by them, when the accumulation of the years and all the many things which they produced will be burned in a single fire. What a broad spectacle then appears!How I will be lost in admiration! How I will laugh! How I will rejoice! I will be full of exaltation then as I see so many great kings who by public report were accepted into heaven groaning in the deepest darkness with Jove himself and alongside those very men who testified on their behalf! They will include governors of provinces who persecuted the name of our Lord burning in flames more fierce than those with which they proudly raged against the Christians! And those wise philosophers who earlier convinced their disciples that God was irrelevant and who claimed either that there is no such thing as a soul or that our souls would not return to their original bodies will be ashamed as they burn in the conflagration with those very disciples! And the poets will be there, shaking with fear, not in front of the tribunal of Rhadamanthus or Minos, but of the Christ they did not anticipate!* Then it will be easier to hear the tragic actors, because their voices will be more resonant in their own calamity” (better voices since they will be screaming in greater terror). “The actors will then be easier to recognize, for the fire will make them much more agile. Then the charioteer will be on show, all red in a wheel of fire, and the athletes will be visible, thrown, not in the gymnasium, but in the fire, unless I have no wish to look at their bodies then, so that I can more readily cast an insatiable gaze on those who raged against our Lord. ‘This is the man,’ I will say, ‘the son of a workman or a prostitute’” (in everything that follows and especially in the well-known description of the mother of Jesus from the Talamud, Tertullian from this point on is referring to the Jews) “the destroyer of the Sabbath, the Samaritan possessed by the devil. He is the man whom you brought from Judas, the man who was beaten with a reed and with fists, reviled with spit, who was given gall and vinegar to drink. He is the man whom his disciples took away in secret, so that it could be said that he was resurrected, or whom the gardener took away, so that the crowd of visitors would not harm his lettuce.’ What praetor or consul or quaestor or priest will from his own generosity grant this to you so that you may see such sights, so that you can exult in such things?* And yet we already have these things to a certain extent through faith, represented to us by the imagining spirit. Besides, what sorts of things has the eye not seen or the ear not heard and what sorts of things have not arisen in the human heart?” (1. Cor. 2, 9). “I believe these are more pleasing than the race track and the circus and both enclosures” (first and fourth tier of seats or, according to others, the comic and tragic stages). Through faith: that’s how it’s written.*
16
Let’s bring this to a conclusion. The two opposing values “good and bad,” “good and evil” have fought a fearful battle on earth for thousands of years. And if it’s true that the second value has for a long time had the upper hand, even now there’s still no lack of places where the battle goes on without a final decision. We could even say that in the intervening time the battle has been constantly drawn to greater heights and in the process to constantly greater depths and has become constantly more spiritual, so that nowadays there is perhaps no more decisive mark of a “higher nature,” a more spiritual nature, than that it is split in that sense and is truly still a battleground for those opposites. The symbol of this battle, written in a script which has remained legible through all human history up to the present, is called “Rome Against Judea, Judea Against Rome.” To this point there has been no greater event than this war, this posing of a question, this contradiction between deadly enemies. Rome felt that the Jew was like something contrary to nature itself, its monstrous polar opposite, as it were. In Rome the Jew was considered “guilty of hatred against the entire human race.” And that view was correct, to the extent that we are right to link the health and the future of the human race to the unconditional rule of aristocratic values, the Roman values. By contrast, how did the Jews feel about Rome? We can guess that from a thousand signs, but it is sufficient to treat ourselves again to the Apocalypse of John, that wildest of all written outbursts which vengeance has on its conscience. (Incidentally, we must not underestimate the deep consistency of the Christian instinct, when it ascribed this very book of hate to the name of the disciple of love, the same man to whom it attributed that enthusiastic amorous gospel—: there is some truth to this, no matter how much literary counterfeiting may have been necessary for this purpose). The Romans were indeed strong and noble men, stronger and nobler than any people who had lived on earth up until then or even than any people who had ever been dreamed up. Everything they left as remains, every inscription, is delightful, provided that we can guess what is doing the writing there. By contrast, the Jews were par excellence that priestly people of ressentiment, who possessed an unparalleled genius for popular morality. Just compare people with related talents—say, the Chinese or the Germans —with the Jews, in order to understand what is ranked first and what is ranked fifth. Which of them has proved victorious for the time being, Rome or Judea? Surely there’s not the slightest doubt. Just think of who it is people bow down to today in Rome itself as the personification of all the highest values—and not only in Rome, but in almost half the earth, all the places where people have become merely tame or want to become tame—in front of three Jews, as we know, and one Jewess (in front of Jesus of Nazareth, the fisherman Peter, the carpet maker Paul, and the mother of the first-mentioned Jesus, named Mary). This is very remarkable: without doubt Rome has been conquered. It is true that in the Renaissance there was an incredibly brilliant reawakening of the classical ideal, the noble way of evaluating everything. Rome itself behaved like someone who had woken up from a coma induced by the pressure of the new Jewish Rome built over it, which looked like an ecumenical synagogue and was called “the church.” But Judea immediately triumphed again, thanks to that basically vulgar (German and English) movement of ressentiment, which we call the Reformation, together with what had to follow as a result, the re-establishment of the church—as well as the re-establishment of the old grave-like tranquillity of classical Rome. In what is an even more decisive and deeper sense than that, Judea once again was victorious over the classical ideal at the time of the French Revolution. The last political nobility which there was in Europe, in seventeenth and eighteenth century France, broke apart under the instincts of popular ressentiment—never on earth has there been heard a greater rejoicing, a noisier enthusiasm! It’s true that in the midst of all this the most dreadful and most unexpected events took place: the old ideal itself stepped physically and with unheard of splendour before the eyes and the conscience of humanity— and once again stronger, simpler, and more urgently than ever rang out, in opposition to the old lying slogan of ressentiment about the privileged rights of the majority, in opposition to that will for a low condition, for abasement, for equality, for the decline and extinguishing of mankind—in opposition to all that there rang out a fearsome and delightful counter-slogan about the rights of the very few! As a last signpost to a different road, Napoleon appeared, the most singular and late-born man there ever was, and in him the problem of the inherently noble ideal was made flesh—we should consider well what a problem that is: Napoleon, this synthesis of the inhuman and the superhuman. . . .
17
— Did that end it? Was that greatest of all opposition of ideals thus set ad acta [aside] for all time? Or was it merely postponed, postponed indefinitely? . . .  Some day, after a much longer preparation, will an even more fearful blaze from the old fire not have to take place?  More than that: wouldn’t this be exactly what we should hope for with all our strength? Even will it? Even demand it? Anyone who, like my readers, begins to reflect on these points, to think further, will have difficulty coming to a quick conclusion—reason enough for me to come to a conclusion myself, provided that it has been sufficiently clear for a long time what I want, precisely what I want with that dangerous slogan which is written on the body of my last book: “Beyond Good and Evil” . . . At least this does not mean “Beyond Good and Bad.”—"

Nothing's for real what you say or do
You're ordinary - so bizarre
Letting your money talk
Uh - it's meaning all to you
Who do you think that you are
Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade
I guarantee - that you're going down that way
Too late to see - nothing left to change
You're full of hot air
Nothing's for real what you say or do
You're ordinary - so bizarre
Letting your money talk
Uh - it's meaning all to you
Who do you think that you are
Enough is enough
Man you're not worth a dime
Don't need a knife in my back
I don't wanna be a part of your game
You f*cking egomaniac
Bootlicker - pretending to be
Bootlicker - don't try to suck up on me
Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade
Bloody pretender
You're all I hate
Bloody pretender
Now I'm seeing through your masquerade"

Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles
Will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us, once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas, guitar!

6162,"Journey into the wildest of dreams
In a land of the eternal spring
Bards are playing the songs of the old
Long forsaken a story untold

Come with me on the meadow of gold
Lies the world which no mortals have seen
Time ago was committed a sin
Newborn blood of the ancients within

Once he came to a magical wall
Mirror showed him the way to the past
Only one who can open the gate
To divine where he will meet his fate

Then in silence he opened the door
Stream of infinite light on his face
As he walked through the portal alone
Wind carried him to vastness of space

High above the mountains
My spirit's flying free
Life is neverending
So don't cry for me"

Electro-magnet!

It’s an elaborate system of strap-on wires
(Stop this kindness)
In the [?] of your skull
(Your [?] is endless)
Your thought and dreams can be instantly recorded

Visions captured without time for evaluate
(What doesn’t blind us envisions us)
And/or interpretation
(Prisons in nightmare everywhere)
Onto paper or screen, whatever format
(In a separate or known [?])
Instantaneous pure art form
(And even less than time)
Straight from the horse’s head
(I find the test of time)
Doors blown open!

I was crying at Pearl’s place
“You’re the prettiest of all the girls
Stick every piece of garbage in my eye”
“Surprise,” the scryer sighs

Instigation
Craft is burnt out!"

I love purple like this shit spiritual
I wanted wock, a red miracle
I've been on my point, I'm calling and hope they sneak into it
Hear it in my voice, I'm higher than what I meant to do
Ay, of course
Ay, its just different with me
I know everything I know, it ain't no secrets with me
This the only me she know
I got reapers really love me but I'm praying where I go
I got mellow habits
Too good to get back what I stole, ay
If we made diamonds cause it was chemistry
I rather think than to match the enemy
We made diamonds cause it was chemistry

We'll arrive with empty hands, we will fill them as we fade
'till it overflows, and the waves will carry us back to shore
The current will carry us apart. We’ll drift away, somewhere far
And the deepest blue will hold us for a while
To let us mourn our loss, until we realize
And this emptiness is hard to fill
And I'm sure that it never will
Things just seem to happen that way
I miss you more than I did yesterday
Well the simple smile you gave last night, reminds me of the better times
The morning left me empty but relieved
Please let this day go by and meet again somewhere when I'm asleep
And this emptiness is hard to fill
And I'm sure that it never will
Things just seem to happen that way
I miss you more than I did yesterday"

Things is funny ain't shit really changed
Cats get out of pocket and make small change
This ain't a game, lyrically I'm still the same
What I lack I gain it's a (?) hurting game
Rhymes is raw, my people still hating on me more
Everytime I turn around it's not a positive course
Rhymes is real, swimming in the fountain of youth
And I'm only telling you how I feel and in truth
Time is time, these chicks done lost they mind
Got the nerve tell me tighten it up like one time
L.A. scene OG's know what I mean
Each one teach one, now we all as one
Rolling through the streets ain't nothing really changed
Talk to my god man, I'm not ashamed
At the end of the day I deal with this
Cause between me and him ain't nothing like this

Now it's like the early 90's and we're out on tour
Did a lot of good things for good rappers and more
Life is real you never know who gets a good deal
So you pay for the best to make it with stress
Baby's skill and baby's man that's a real deal
Raised in the dope invirement that's ill
The war is on and you hear from corner to corner
Mommy cried about it know it's dangerous
Take my time give you my vision
Watch me addapt give you my attention
The truth in the matter is, man we're still around
Ride beats like water so you'll hear the sound
Hoodlomic slang, bet you all know the game
Group Home still here, baby feel the name
Put a lot of work in, man feel the ground
East new york represent if you know the town

Too many times I've tried to right wrongs
Too many times I've lied at night lone
Tryin to fight on, find that light home
Once that lights on believe I'm so gone so
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me now
Don't wait for me it's too late for me
Cuz Imma be runnin

Year four before my door fast
Three years passed with colder forecasts to come
And though I never look back I run
From the past like it's after me blasting guns
I dodge bullets, triggers I might pull if
Deaths all that I got left in life to give
Tempted by the types of life who live
Life like life's just night to night, clueless
I do this
I thought you knew this
And yeah I'm proud but damn I feel useless
Ruthless, the booth is some excuse it's stupid
Used to do this oozin music nightly
And cruising through this writin daily
Now it's like I'm hikin in lightning lazy
Man I just can't do it I gotta take a break
Damn, I think I got some decisions I gotta make
-Hook-

And just because I'm running out of time
Don't mean it don't matter
My pockets getting thinner n I'm sick of hitting dad up
When I'm tryna get some gas up in my Acura to smash it
Chasing dreams feel like Ash I gotta catch em all
But damn after all this time
How do I keep moving my feet forward
It's been a real long ride, and I don't too many signs
Grandpa I'd die to hear your word
Your life's my world, given any minute
Reflecting on mine, wishing you were in it
A fraction of a second I promise you I would split it
But it's hard to get started when you can't see a finish
But you've already witnessed men pass to infinite
Lord willingly let his past be instilled in me
Give me back my will to breathe
So I can take a deep breath and leave

-Hook-

My life's changing
My lifes pages have turned to be cold
As cold as ice ages
Folded like Razors, torn like tornadoes
Scorn filled to warn and ward neighbors off
Halos off I'm back to sin
Bout to take the whole game no practicin
In fact given the situation that were in
I feel its fair your aware you are half the men
That I am so I plan to combat with them
I will battle them, I will capture them
And make they face turn pale, Jim Gaffigan
Cuz yuh muthafuckin boy N.O.I.S. back again
And Imma be here for a minute indeed
I'm willing to be competing with silly mc's all day
I must say it feels good to be home
The light's on bright and I'm already gone

Lost my partners to the same thang
Lord forgive us please have mercy
Lost my uncle to the drug game

My OG’s sold cocaine, tryna whip up a McFlurry
I can still smell the pots burning
I can still smell the Glocks burning
Had a plan but the cops learned it

Yo Stan!  Kick a little funky rhythm before I begin
Yeah I’m with it

I gotta admit, boys are high on my list
I love to have a cutie, cold wrapped around my wrist
Like a Rolex to flex for, one to adore me
Buy me jewels and go act the fool for me like [?]
Know his name, shut up and [?] me (why?)
He has a big ole booty, that women would love to see jiggle and wiggle
But it’s packed so tight, it doesn’t even move a little
He’s firm, the boy holds the future behind him
If his butt could hold a mic, no one could out rhyme him
I’m a fiend for a king with a nice backside
A pure Nubian brother and yo don’t ask why
Kept it dope, I had to scope
On a weekends, me and my friends are like chill
Til we see a physique fit to kill then we ill
Rolling down the boulevard
Head in a max, you know we got a few cute ones, but most are cold whack

I’m a guy watcher, cause yo girls go too
But I never speak first, I’m too quiet for that
I walk by, catch his eye, and just like that
He falls victim in a second or less to be exact
Now he’s keeping my stroll
All the jealous staying back
Now here’s the facts
I’m quite sure his name was Pete
Pete should have been a butcher
Cause he had all the beef
The guy is quite dimensional with exceptional potential to be the man of everything
I’m here to let you know the guys, I could never live without true
I tell the truth, no need to be sup he was jammin’, body slammin’

Skinny boys are cool too, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for em
I mean, flesh is my fetish, but uh, I don’t ignore them
Way back in the days I had a boy named James
His smile was perfect and his face the same
With a cocoa complexion the skin of perfection
Now with a mug like that, who needs to flex?
And he’s the educated type of f-e-double l-a comma
The kind of guy I can take home to momma
Built like Magic, moves likes Jordan
With this kinda guy I couldn’t help but be sportin
I had a jones for poems this guy was it, [?] legit
Skinny boys are a hit, he stole my heart
Right from the start
I love all kinds of guys, those sweet ass honeys
Short ones, tall ones, those with a lot of money
The broke ones, well I can live without [?]
I’m not biased, but you know what I mean

I don’t like the fellas in a purple tration
But on a real, dollas help a situation
The body is optional as long as it’s optical to lounge in bikinis on an island that’s tropical
I live my life like an eagle wild and free
Any guy that can hang, can chill with me
There’s not many and since I am here to tell the truth
I cannot tell a lie because I’m not sup
I love guys, fly guys
All kinds of boys, you know?
Short ones, tall ones, fat boys—um, fat ones, eh I don’t like fat ones
Not really, I can’t lie
I don’t like fat kids, I cannot … I can’t lie
I can’t lie I don’t like them, you know what I mean?
I guess [?] they like fat boys
But if you lose weight we can talk
Fat gives you better return, that’s it
Fat gives better return, that’s it
Maybe when I die I’ll like fat boys
Cut me off before I murder myself and don’t sell records"

7956,"Verse 1
Eyo once upon a rhyme some time not long ago
There was a little knuckle headed brat with awesome flow
Yo he would dream that he'd get money and cars and blow
But when he woke up this kid he thought he lost his soul
His teachers said he came across as slow but they ain't know
'Bout the struggles that would bubble in his awkward skull
Every morning like a nightmare walking to class rocking some
Busted up nike airs no one would laugh but the
Feeling was still right there homie didn't speak
He thought the holes he felt inside his soul were only in his sneaks
He spent a lot of time at home mostly with his peeps
Would've played outside but it was cold and lonely in the streets
Thinking why would God throw me in this beast
And deep into the night he would hold his dreams closely in his sleep
Man around the time the skies blew up his moms moved
With music by his side as he grew up yo this is my story

Verse 2
And then high school
Came shorty was going through his resistant stages
Distant faces fam moving through different places
This kid was anxious so his style stayed inside
Cause blazing by from town to town made him shy
A loner who hung around his corner with a few friends
Some were snakes some were true kin just doing
The same shit that you would do if ever you've been
Inside the shoes of students of the game trying to prove then
That you and your bro not punks he grew status
And traded his new balances for low top dunks
Kicking rhymes in the lunch room just him and his mans
For different fans 'fore they even had a business plan
Yo they was mad young only pen and pads no one had funds
But still they found a way to laugh and just have fun
He graduated even though he played a fool
Something changed when he went away to school though
Verse 3
Right before the first LP and twelve G's later in school loans
It was time to kill the game and put these haters in tomb stones
He flew home his crew grown his plans in tact
They didn't hesitate and started making slamming tracks
The fam was back his world lifted but something shifted in his
Brain shit was strange he started looking as his girl different
He saw a lot of ups and downs smiles shrugs and frowns
And stressful nights going to work rocking button downs
Relationships would teeter in and out of danger
From anger to see his pops treat him like a stranger
The pain that it brought about was not a lot of good
He kept it to himself that's probably why nobody understood
He would spit a sentence and emit it in a song
'Til he was calm and felt as if his enemy was gone
A chemistry was spawned this little nigga's energy was strong
It was on as soon as Illin' Spree was born"
9188,"Time goes by
Its getting soar
And I can't let these feelings go
Never though I wouldn't be so sad to see you go
Its far too soon to feel this so
Well seem me now
I'm searching for my hope
And help me now I feel so lost

I have no kind of hope and if only I could settle for
What would happen now
Regardless where I've been
Is there more or am I not so helpless
Have I no control

What hopes do I have and no forms I take
I'd be so ashamed of my mistakes
The story without a face
Life's so out of place
Well excuse me for my haste
I've got so much time to waste
Well tell me now what to do
And show me how he's happy at you

She forever thotty
Lookin' in her eyes when she rides me
Tell her, ""you on top, you ain't no side bitch""
If I ain't hit you from the side, you ain't no side bitch
Don't wanna look like a thotty
She don't wanna look thotty
Cause everybody thinks YG a thotty
I hate baby girl blockhead
Cause she gave the whole block head
She wanna feel special
She tells me, ""buy me something special""
She tells me, ""take us somewhere special""
This little bitch a handful
When they know you got a footlong
They tryna make you do the extra long
They make you go extra hard
Makes you gas and don't call
Shoppin' sprees at the mall to make 'em feel like your broad
Cancun and Cabo trips, all types of extra shit
You done spent a $100,000 on this side bitch, yea

And how they fight to be set free
And how they fight for you and me
And radio radio community

And everybody's got their own set of rules
But we heard about the kids in SLC

And pastures and mountains
I met a lotta folks in a whole lotta towns
I feel a crack in the skin of the majority
They're gonna figure it out
I ain't here to fuck the family

Take your city on a holiday from pain
All you missionaries
Can't you hear what I say?

Just keeps us on the highway
We move idly but I can't sit and wait
With the wind at my back and a thousand new trails to blaze

Main roads built to lead the way
Where they always want me to go
But the forest mountain calls my name
And I'm compelled to feel the stone
To the north I trace the summon sound
Wandered off to seek my trail
Out of bounds I found my home
Far beyond the veil

And if I disappear I'm never gone
Just venturing this story line
Cuz we're all a part of this saga we paint
With the sweat of our brow and the beauty of the human soul

Main roads built to lead the way
Where they always want me to go
But the forest mountain calls my name
And I'm compelled to feel the stone
To the north I trace the summon sound
Wandered off to seek my trail
Out of bounds I found my home
Far beyond the veil"

I swear I feel as though they’re watching my every move

Guess I need to see what's happening!""

I said, one man, who for short we'll call Mo
He went up there, and the Lord he did find
And he learned God's name for all time

He spelled his name with just YHWH
He spelled his name with just YHWH
They have Exodus 3, if you plan to read more
You can learn all about the Lord
He spelled his name with just YHWH
He spelled his name with just YHWH
Can you guess what it means?
Just ""I am that I am""
He's the Lord God of Abraham

Some men spell it L-O-R-D
Some men use a J and a V

Cause he commands us to honour his name
He's our Father, Lord and YHWH
All those names work well when you pray

Back then, with the ancient Hebrews
They did not have A, E, I, Os or Us
And so Moses had no vowels he could buy
Wheel of Fortune shows were so dry
That's why sometimes there when you read
You'll find capitalized letters L-O-R-D
There's a place there for the YHWH
You can just pronounce it ""Yahweh""

They have Exodus 3, if you plan to read more
You can learn all about the Lord

Yahweh, Yahweh, that's the name of renown

Don't look to the light, stay away from the light

Welcome to your funeral!
Taken by the preacher of the pyramidic numeral
From the dungeon, trust me sooner or
Later, I will shake ya, call me Mr. Earthquake
I break the ground, going down for the birth of the awaker
Lion of the East on the streets electrified
Be afraid, very afraid, fuck it, you'll be petrified
From the anti-matter shatter like dreams squawk and scatter
Living in the dark, the heartbeat, the teeth chatter
Frozen in the mist, delinquent derelicts
It's the place, it's the bits where the square peg fits
It's the last refuge den of the damned
The deep hideaway of the original earth clans
So, don't look to the light
Stay away from the light
The light is the lie that hides from the night
The night is the dark that will make your head sweat
So, Mr Spyce, tell 'em, how dark does it get?
Darker than Jehoshaphat, between the folds of fats
With the rats, we be tearing you to tats
Darker than the orifice with the spider's kiss
It's a wish, deep, dark in the abyss

Inside the recess of our minds we be creepy
Don't want no pop just to draw enough attention
Me and the boys lived through more than was meant to
It's essential, that's why we act dark, rap dark
The dark is the last resting place of the Ark
The Ark holds the mysteries of mind and the heart
The heart pumps the blood that's the sum of our parts
Life starts when you dwell near to your death
If there's nowhere to run, it's the only place left
Except the light, but don't be going there
You'll be burnt by the heat, and blinded by the glare

[Chorus: Mr Spyce]

Don't look to the light, stay away from the light
Don't look to the light, stay away from the light
Away from the light, away from the light!

Foaming at the mouth, some cuckoo, sick mother fuckers
Shadow night warrior, will follow you, swallow you
Inside of ya we (?) more plays than the bard
Chalkyard, I've got an ace up my sleeve
To all you heretics, boy, it's time to make ya bleed
Like DeNiro, got the cape of fear
See it there? Run, yeah, run, hide
The ways of my mind got ya claat open wide

[Verse 3: Mr Shylock]
What's that light?!
What's that light? Smash that bulb that's flashing
All it's attracting is insects scratching
Attaching, fucking blood sucking with the [?]
Like the horns of Jericho, I'mma bring down the walls and all
The devil's horses and devil's men
We'll never put the light back together, again
You search for the light through the window in the morning
But it's nothing but another fucking dark day dawning

""Babyface, I'm in. As we emerge from the underground with a different kind of 70s sound. Ah, yeah!""

Don't look to the light
Just another dark day dawning
Don't look to the light

Just another dark day dawning
Don't look to the light

Just another dark day dawning
Don't look to the light

Just another dark day dawning
Don't look to the light

Just another dark day dawning

7893,"[Chorus]
Running in the streets since the break of dawn
Half these haters out there trying to figure me out
I came from nothing I came from nothing
I came from nothing singing this song hum yeah

[VERSE I]
Ready to go with my kicks on
Chasing my ghost I go head long
Run these tracks a theme song
And right now I’m in my zone
Just make sure that you’re on it
Prove me better you own it
Big stars under big spots
We gonna prove them that we own it

[PRE Chorus X2]
I’m blessed
I’m gifted (hum hum)
My faith
Got me lifted (hum hum)

Running in the streets since the break of dawn
Half these haters out there trying to figure me out
I came from nothing I came from nothing
I came from nothing singing this song hum yeah

[VERSE 2]
I came out from none
I want you to know
I made it my way
Some came through the door
I don’t need your props
I’m needing the gold
No need to brag
No need to show
Hard knocks graduated need proof?
If I do so leave an option on truce
Underrated till the other go snooze
Real champs make no excuse
I’ve been in the mud
Been through the rain
Listen close you might learn a thing
The doing is hard
The bragging is easy
Stick to your goal you might beat the pain
Papa said listen be true to your self
I’ve never been fake but yet I’ve been fooled
Hum you’re thinking out the box now
I ain’t changing the game
I’m changing the rules
[PRE Chorus X2]
I’m blessed
I’m gifted (hum hum)
My faith
Got me lifted (hum hum)

Running in the streets since the break of dawn
Half these haters out there trying to figure me out
I came from nothing I came from nothing
I came from nothing singing this song hum yeahh

I came from nothing, singing this song"

What is real and what is fantasy
Are you who you are or what you want to be

Your kind breeds conceit
Fact and fiction conceived
You don't know you only see
Words not deeds

A perceived perception or factual entity
All you know is who I'm supposed to be

Your kind breeds conceit
Fact and fiction conceived
You don't know you only see
Words not deeds

Adding more fuel to the lie that you fire
I'm living the truth while you're projecting a liar"

The war, I'm losin with myself
I can't control your anger spells
Each time I run away, I'm heading for the door
Each time I turn away I fall into the ground and I say
I am leaving here tomorrow
You're always on my mind
I need to be reminded, out of sight, out of mind
I get sad when you are happy, and that may be unkind
I am leaving here tomorrow
Out of sight, out of mind
The girls on broadway make me sad, girls with blonde hair like you always had
Walking their puppies, it makes me repair
Drinkin their coffee and talkin to their friends
Each time I turn around I try to say goodbye
Each time I babble on I see that you are still all mine and
I am leaving here tomorrow
You're always on my mind
I need to be reminded, out of sight, out of mind
I get sad when you are happy, and that may be unkind
I am leaving here tomorrow
Out of sight, out of mind
Don't forget to play your willow time
And leave me bits so I can clear my heart and say that
I am leaving here tomorrow
You're always on my mind
Don't need to be reminded, out of sight, out of mind
I get mad when you are happy, and that may be unkind
I am leaving here tomorrow
Out of sight, out of mind
Out of sight, out of mind"

Does his teeth, bite to eat, and he’s rolling

The week ends, the week begins

Wondering what the other is thinking
But we never say a thing
And these crimes between us grow deeper

She feeds him well, has concerns; he forgets them
And remembers being small
Playing under the table and dreaming

Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
Lights down, you up and die
Driving in on this highway
All these cars end up on the sidewalk

People in every direction
No words exchanged; no time to exchange them

When all the little ants are marching
Red and black and antennae waving
They all do it the same
They all do it the same way

Candyman tempting the thoughts of a
Sweet tooth tortured by the weight loss
Program cutting the corners
Loose end, loose end, cut, cut
On the fence, could not to offend
Cut, cut, cut, cut

Take these chances
Place them in a box until a quieter time
Lights down; you up and die

Yeaaaaaaaah!
Lights down; you up and die

Play it off like it's all a game of tag
Golden snitch with the cooties she just needs to get a facemask
What? Trace me back to my roots
Hunter gatherer society is what my niggas do
Got Ashanti telling stories while he's weaving webs of words
I'm sitting here lyrically spitting some shitty verse
An articulate extraodinary nigga rapping faster
While the titties growing bigger and our raps are getting badder
Use that alliteration too
Blonde bitches backside, butt turning black and blue
No, girl you just need to sit down
All you hear are stupid jokes that are coming out my mouth
Wait bitch, what the fuck is this shit?
An inaccurate song produced by a crazy lyricist

Would you seek?
Would you find?

And said you loved me

While you think that you're all still alive
Til the taste of the tears will remind
What you feel
What you'd feared
What you'd find
It's the moment that won't let you down
It's your scream when you can't make a sound
It's all you see with the tears rolling down

Papers will all say her name
And probably print the wrong date
The day that you die
Cause we're all gonna die
Cute little puppies and bunnies and birds
People who sing when they don't know the words
You will die
Cause we're all gonna die

The army of lawyers that threaten to sue
The hookers that blow them when I just want food
And the asshats that download and never buy tunes

You dumb scientologists
And guys who bend spoons
And buddhists, sort of
And athiests too
All you wackjob believers
Nobody's immune
You will die
Cause we're all gonna die
Kiss your ass goodbye
And sarcastic song writers
Guys with tattoos, drummers and bassists and engineers too
And every last person that sang in this room

Love the way you look but I prefer it when you’re wearing less
Let’s rewind the tape and do it over without all the mess
I don’t want to do it with these other girls they’re not the best

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can slow a little
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can live a little

We can dream a little
Touch a little

And I’ll come running back your way
You just say the word

Just remember the good days baby
When the feeling just wasn’t hard to find
Just remember the good days baby
When you were mine

[Verse 3]
I will make you breakfast in the morning when you’re still in bed
I will give my shoulder and my time whenever you’re upset
I used to be dumb and immature but now there’s nothing left
All my life I’ve been a fool when you were there in flashing red

[Verse 4]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can breathe a little
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can kiss a little
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We can play a little
Bite a little

Look, pull up in the coupe like woo
Shit, the marijuana, they can smell that
Got your bitch here chillin' on the block, bruh
And I'mma run it through it like tailback, B-Oh-Dub
Look up to the top, all you see is us
Niggas hatin' like we give a fuck
IE, IE, say it 2 times
Now watch me go dumb like the little bus
Turn me up!
Nigga, I remember sitting on the curb writing raps
Jay [?] had a strap on him
Probly plottin' on a lick something quick, heard pssh
Had a brick, new whip, couple stacks on 'em so you know
A nigga trynna ride out
Shit, his bitch told me where he hide out
I hit [?] on the [?] like we finna go to work, nigga
I guess it's time to bring the squad out
Nigga, I don't wanna hear it if it ain't about the money
If a nigga talk about me on a track, I'mma run it
Heard your bitch trynna kick it, if she come, then I punt it
If you're broke, then I won't expect you to keep it 100
Yeah, that's what my pops told me
See I was raised by a real OG
Same nigga right now, same nigga back then
Thank God I don't wake up everyday up in a pen
[Hook]
No sleep, no sleep
Don't pray for me, mama, pray for the weak
Since a young been raised round G's
All work we don't know how to dream
My nigga, no sleep, no sleep
Don't pray for me, mama, pray for the weak
Since a young been raised round G's
All work we don't know how to dream
My nigga, no sleep

[Verse 2]
Eyes low from the good weed
Fuck nigga what you know about it?
If you need it, then you know we got it
We gratuated from the streets, we ain't go to college
See, Doughboy and O-Dog was my role models
Walk around the club with a gold bottle
Gold chain got me lookin' like a flashlight
Probly was a drug lord in my past life
Turn me up!
Nigga lookin' in my son's eyes
Shit, I don't wanna see my son cry
I'm in my rearview lookin' for the one time
To get life, nigga, all it takes is one time
I never slip, nigga, get a grip, all about my chip
Give me that, nigga, give me this
Get up off my dick
Fuck a dream, nigga, fuck a wish
Trynna get rich
Trynna diss like I'm in a scope, bet I don't miss, nope
I been on my grind for a while, nigga
Stop goin' up like [?]
In my shoes, boy, you wouldn't reach a mile, nigga
My whole team stay connected like a house phone
Bus ride to the mills every weekend
J's just dropped up in the cash out
I'm probably in a foreign, finna smash out
Only way that I know is the cash road

No sleep, no sleep
Don't pray for me, mama, pray for the weak

It’s amazing how these things can’t change never lose faith
I’ve been walking down the street so cold hoping for grace
Coz oh this path I’ve taken seems so long will I be okay
The troubles that I seem to find seem not to fade away

But I’m gonna love you babe
Time I know gets to fade away but you and I should babe
Will you be mine
Babe time I know it will never change I’m here tryna save today
You know why I feel this way oh babe
Time I know it will never change you and I should stay the same babe
Will you be mine

8266,"I can remember you, child,
As I stood in a hot, white
Room at the window watching
The people and cars taking
Turn at the traffic lights.
I can remember you, our first
Fierce confrontation, the tight
Red rope of love which we both
Fought over. It was square
Environmental blank, disinfected
Of paintings or toys. I wrote
All over the walls with my
Words, coloured the clean squares
With the wild, tender circles
Of our struggle to become
Separate. We want, we shouted,
To be two, to be ourselves.

Neither won nor lost the struggle
In the glass tank clouded with feelings
Which changed us both. Still I am fighting
You off, as you stand there
With your straight, strong, long
Brown hair and your rosy
Defiant glare, bringing up
From the heart's pool that old rope,
Tightening about my life,
Trailing love and conflict,
you ask may you skate
In the dark, for one more hour."

At the gate
Hammered skulls

Stripped and beaten
Upon the ice
Naked blackened frozen limbs
Bodies twisted smashed and bent
Scattered upon the permafrost

Into your eyes
Cut and eat
Of your own flesh

Silent isolation
Psychiatric experimentation

Gnaw at stone
Writhe with pain
Work till death

Grinding down
A thin gauge line
Deep into the northern forests
Those were Mordovia's blackest nights

No graves were dug
The ground was ice
For human flesh
Beasts would fight

Hang yourself

And you were just apart of my past, just a fake lucid dream
Was it really built to last? No, it was never meant to be
And when the truth will amass, I'll be your worst enemy
I knew this girl when I was young
I made her think we were in love
Playin' date but I didn't give a fuck
We were only 18, really messed her up
I'm sorry my dear, but that ain't enough
Wish I could take back all that I've done
But I'm full of lies, so I won't because
My friends told me (Wait, wait, what did they tell you?)

[Verse 2]
Is this love? What if it was? Was she a dove? Stop making a fuss
I've had enough, I've lost my touch. Remember when we met on that bus?
We talked about stuff, from push to shove, I was driven by some questionable lust
I wanted her love, I want her so much, so I can play her heart until it stops
The art of words is a deadly game
As emotions burst, she becomes insane
As her love burns and affects her brain
It's her turn and she can't play
She only flirts, she lost her faith
She kills and hurts, she my yandere
She is completely cursed, I made her that way
So now, thanks to me

They told me karma is a bitch
So I might take her on a date
Say pretty lies straight to her face
Act like her best friends are insane
You'll say you're pretty and I'll say you're vain

Unless you’re sitting with me
Can’t do this without you

When I met you, I could not believe my еyes
Yeah, you stole my hеart
You’re so pretty, I could cry
Six years, I couldn’t wait a second more
You’re the girl that I prayed for my whole life
Yeah, break it down
Don’t want to break you down
Won’t catch me flaking out, yeah
I knew that someone would come my way
Who would take all my pain away

They hate me
But, it don’t faze me
Could never break my heart (could never break my heart)
Baby, you’re the only one for me
You’ll forever be my love

How life has treated me

At the funeral's night
Silence is the only sound
You've smoked the last chance
And you're out

Flesh and bone
Left alone
Without the soul
Lost the pain
Never again
The body unchained

Withered are the days
Faded the nights
Oh no, you're gone
You're on your own

You've sown your seed
Into the mud of the earth
Falling, you're falling

Never too late to say ""I've been well""

But I'd rather be in hell with you

So we cry together apart
Till the tears turn into water under the bridges

The blood you cry with your heart
Soon will run to somе kid you'll have with another man
That you'll nevеr love
It's never too late to leave things unsaid
Never too late to state ""Time goes on""
But it's way too late to say ""I think I was the one who was wrong""

You used to say that my arms kept you safe
That when you're with me, you were never afraid

I'm sure you say that still
Only, this time, it's to someone else

Never too late to say ""I'm glad you were once mine""
Never too late to say ""I'm sure I'll be fine""

And it's true

What's the cause of this plan//
Whats the cost for a man//
To simply have his demands//
You gave me beautiful feelings//
You only stimulate hatred/
Why don't you give me a meaning//

I really mean it I'm begging//
I need a reason for living//
Is it hard to just give me what I ask for really!//

When she feels ill she counts on you too cure the problem at hand//
Shit she don't believe in a doctor to solve that//

2805,"Floating up to the hole in the sky
To the casual wink of Uranus's wandering eye
I looked down somewhere over Europe
And let down a rope with Zeus on my side
And Cypress was pointing her bony finger
At the hole she'd make in Turkey's belly
And Kithira could hear nothing else but the noise
Of Laconia's engulfing war yell

Is she tartarean again today
With her aphrodisiac, the tarantella sway?
In anagogical vision, I am what I see
In anaclitical remission, there's nothing more to be
And I hit a wall with all I had
A start even with the first kiss
It ended in a scream of pain
I broke every bone in the red fist

And I face it, she makes the world spin
She makes all of us somehow kin
And makes everything the same as it's always been
So I've let down my rope to reel anyone in
And Uranus's scrotum's a totem pole
In the middle of Washington state
It tells the story of what went down in our house
It tells the story of our lust-driven, bearded, beautiful fate"

The band on stage is tuning
Jacarandas are blooming

Puts my mind at ease

The Merrimack River is flowing
Thunder rolling over

Don't say you're not amazed when you know you are
And don't say you're not afraid when you know you are

Rows of boys and girls
Line up to see the world
Candy-coated promise
Just out of reach when you want it
Give me something sweet
Bring me to the brink
I'll leave without hesitation
To a world without limitation
Rock me patient, slowly

Don't say you're not amazed when you know you are
And don't say you're not afraid when you know you are
You know you are

A mouth of broken glass
It may not seem so painful
By January, the rain will swallow
Change will follow

Paintings by two warring nations, the phantoms hug the wall
Prisoners trapped inside of nothing, there's nothing left at all
The pictures blind, the eyes of people, who saw the buildings fall

Gods of war!

Laughed until they cried!

Children, wander down by the river, walking on shadows
Dreamers, burning holes in the sky
Does anyone know why?

We're walking on shadows!

Holding hands, they watch the water, afraid of what they'll see
One by onе, they know the answer, and fall down to thеir knees

Close your eyes!

You can't help but see!
Children, wander down by the river, walking on shadows
Dreamers, burning holes in the sky
Does anyone know why?

We're walking on shadows!

The city rose up from the ruins, message etched in pain
If our memories fail to teach us, the skies will burn again
We'll be walking on shadows

Dreamers, burning holes in the sky

And I made it independent, man without no deal
So I'm hanging on, to the pride I got

To my young niggas man, I gotta keep preaching
It's a hard life, another left fold
And I'd give it all back, to the ghetto

Known for freestyling, selling Screw tapes city to city
Pushing rhymes out of state, dipping in the Cali sun

Packing paper in piles, Screw-Zoo blew up the name
Only way I know, to pay it back
Make sure they scream S.U.C., all over the map
Staying down like fo' flats, Avarice connected

Put my freestyling, on a payment plan
Microphone to dats now, control the land

With mansion doors, I stay on the ground
Roll with the down South kings, some of the best you will find

Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Do it for all the ones dyin'
I wanna do it for all the ones cryin'
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh"

*Sirens*
When I think about the future
I imagine havin' kids
But then I realize that I’m (Alone)
And you can’t have kids
If you don’t have a wife
A person to dedicate your whole entire life to
I’m a- (Alone)

[Verse 1]
But I don’t want to stay the same
I remain in my lane ‘cause I don’t know how to connect
Romantically or physically. I’m afraid I may just
Let the girl that I’m with down, end up like all the men
That I’ve seen in my life, who are separated
From the women that they married, the women who carried
Their child in their womb, who they dipped on like poof
Gone in a heartbeat, they left way too soon
(Alone)
[Verse 2]
But I wanna be a better man
Hold the hand of my love
Never let go, wanna be the one to hold her close and
And love her so unconditional so she knows she’s whole

[Bridge]
I’m not a man; I’m so fragile
(Alone)

[Verse 3]
It’s a spark in my heart that pulls me close
Undoubtable attraction for the girls I chose
In the past, but I lack that so
I’m alone. Love at first sight is just a joke;
It’s a one-side dream, never reciprocal
I realize that desire needs some action ‘fore it’s realized
But it seems so forced. I’m the type to believe in fate
But things just may not work that way
Fuck the day that I break a heart
Or mine is taken out my chest
By a bitch with an evil intent

[Refrain]
I just don’t know
If I can get the
Love that I seek
I’m afraid I might just die (Alone)
I just don’t know
If I can get the
Love that I seek
I might just die (Alone)
[Verse 4]
But I believe I can love wholly
If the girl I’m lovin’ believes in me
I’ll worship her mind, worship her body
Fill her void, and she’ll fill mine
We’ll feel fine in each other’s midst
Kissin’ on each other’s lips. This is bliss
We the Yang and Yin. We’re balanced in
Heart and mind, and soul, in love
Nothing will come between us
Loyalty, truth, and respect is
What we’ll hold for each other, our
Expectations. I’ll always meet ‘em
We’ll die together and then meet again
In the afterlife. Never separate
Joined together at heaven’s gates
For eternity. This is the key to my heart
You got it locked. This is when lovin’ starts
Now we’ll never be, never be alone. (Alone)"

Callin' on my cell, but I decline
Comin' for my head like a motherfuckin guillotine

7540,"This life is a dramatization of some designers intention
And I seem to always see the discrepancy in reality
Too many gaps, too many questions in between

Well I know I will burn in hell for this
One day, one day, one day I'll meet my maker
And he'll say, good game, we were all very entertained
One day, one day, I will meet my maker
And they will say the gods were entertained
And I will say it's just not what I expected
This life is a mеmory of the last one, Gods little rеrun
And I seem to always be the willing slave to technology
Too many gaps, too many spaces in between
It can't be perfect
One day, one day, one day I'll meet my maker
He will say good game, we were all very impressed with you
Nothing left put two in my chest, one in my head and make sure that I'm dead
Nothing I do will ever change your mind
To try to change your mind is a waste of time
And I don't know if you've ever felt like this
But I am through
One day, one day I'll meet my maker
He'll say good game, we were all very impressed with you"

So I finally
Reached over
And held your hand

So tell me that
You love me!
I can't bear it
Any longer!
You told me
You weren't lying!

That you're deceiving!

That I own!

Wake up to the whole room shaking, get up, wipe the dirt out my eyes, then
Run over to a blown-out window, it’s a war going on outside, man
Shit, I can see smoke in the distance and a fire lighting up the horizon
Hear the bombs going off in the background and the screams as a bitch nigga dies, and
It’s a goddamn dark moon rising, clouds of burgundy dripping plasma
Concrete cracking under your feet, it’s a fucking recipe for disaster
But I can’t stop now, though, so I gots to go harder, stronger, faster
And it gotta be quicker than the next nigga, can’t get caught by these bastards
Another day in the concrete jungle, where only the strong’ll survive, and
It’s a place where the kind get killed and the cutthroats keep on thriving
So the only way you can stay alive in a place like this where your life means nothing
Boy, you’d better be ready when the shit go down ‘cause it ain’t no future in your fronting
They assumed that they pushed the button, cancel Christmas and get below
Better chuck a roller then run for cover ‘cause if you don’t, they gon’ get you, bro
You’ve go nowhere to go, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Yeah, this is the feeling inside
When a trill-ass nigga start riding to that violent-ass music

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
This be the music for the violent nigga
This be the music for the violent nigga
This be the music for the violent nigga
For the violent nigga, for the violent nigga, for the violent nigga
This be the music for the violent nigga
This be the music for the violent nigga
This be the music for the violent nigga
For the violent nigga, for the violent nigga
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
When I step up in the building
Break a nigga back, break a nigga foot, chop a nigga, YAH, YAH, YAH, YAH
And I’m hoping you ain’t with him when a nigga get him in to kill him, STAR, STAR, STAR, STAR
Bumbaclot, shitting on these niggas with a jumbo fart
Beat a nigga ‘till he do a somersault, and everything about it is your fucking fault
I give you what you want, that’s what you’re asking for
I don’t even really think you bastards want it
Kind of music niggas get they ass whooped to
And put on World Star, somebody cameracord it
It’s VIOLENCE! See, now we lookin’ half dead, you’d better life support it
Funny, now the nigga’s little wifey on it – UGLY!
The news channel might record it
Leave me alone – trust me nigga
You don’t really wanna start, bitch
When I reach for the chrome, it won’t be the ratchet
Beat a nigga with a crowbar, bitch
Psychopath – fire from the blowtorch, I’ll light your ass
Blue four-fifth like a Blue Nose Pit and when I let it go, it’ll bite your ass

Nigga think he bulletproof, unhurtable
Make him take a bullet and fuck if he took it personal
Niggas know I’m ruthless – convertible
They say “fuck what you heard” but I ain’t heard of ‘em
Click, clack – ‘bout to load up
Know a nigga Arm & Hammer, it’s baking soda
Know a nigga armed - I’m Bobby Chawla
Got that .45 in the whip when I rolled up
I told your motherfucking ass I’m gonna
I can get violent, motherfucker, no cover
Beat a young fucker completely a different color
Damn, when my finger roll on the trigger, no lover
Fucker – your bitch is chicken like Roscoe’s
I got the syrup on me like waffles
My life is a motherfucking movie, nigga
You’d think my shit was a novel
How, take that clip, that’s hollows
Hundred rounds in that drum, bitch
Y’all pussy like a Tom bitch
Whoopie Goldberg got ‘em all numb, bitch
That talk again, no, you need to pawn that
DJ Paul, know you heard of me
Bitch I got that tummy tuck
We usin’ tommy guns, no surgery

[Verse 4: Gunplay]
As violent as I am? Ask yourself “now, should I try him?”
He might have a knife or may be packing iron
He skinny but his heart brolic, hard to back him down
If he miss the first time, he loop it back around
For every loss, somebody die (POW)
Then he walk off like nothing happened, ""La di da""
Then write a rap, record that shit and shotty’s mine
That nigga’s name is Gunplay and that’s what he ‘bout
A nigga don’t be with that shit, forget that shit
My stick’ll turn a car into a coffin when it hit that shit
Your bitch screaming too, she hit and bleeding too
Now that’s what happens when you take a peek into my freaking zoo
Bring drama like all up in your mama life
And all my niggas the Kaddafi and Osama type
The war’s on, yeah that’s what it’s sounding like
Dumpin’ on these cunts talking shit until they sounding right

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

I just have to work a little bit, no school"", man holla back

There  once was a man named Stanley
Who people considered so manly
But the truth must be told, he was not very old
And was quite particularly gangly
What Stanley liked most was buttons
He pushed them like some kind of glutton
He did it all day, in a meaningful way, but his brain
Had long ceased to function
Which is why he's in this parable
And lives and existence quite terrible
And if you are not strong but keep playing along
You too will become quite unbearable

You too, will becomе quite unbearable

Modern myths that must be true
Quick confessions that make good sense

[Verse]
I know that black is beautiful, but can they see it?
I know that black is powerful, but can they feel it?
Done talkin', now we're past reason
There's only more glass behind all these glass ceilings, uh
Do you know how hard it is for us to trust
When you get strip-searched just for runnin' for the bus?
And you're only thirteen, you don't tell nobody else
No, you just blame yourself
Then you see 'em tearin' down your history in the media
That you don't learn in school, you gotta learn on Wikipedia
They tell you you're a menace 'til you think that you ain't good enough
All because you got your hoodie up, man
There'll be some trouble you get in just for the colour of your skin
But don't forget to look after your brothers 'cause they're kings
Don't forget to look after your sisters 'cause they're queens
Do not let them kill our dreams, man
If you're killin' us with violence, why should we be killin' you with kindness?
I've done some bad things but I don't glorify 'em
You might have bought my ancestors but you ain't bought my silence
I'm Malcolm for the outcome, I can't let nobody doubt it
That's why we can't just say we're black and proud, we gotta shout it
They don't wanna let us through to the top
I'd go back to where I came from if I knew where that was
They're killin' people in the States
There's people gettin' killed on our estate
Feds say that they gotta put in our place
But look at Grenfell, they can't even put 'em in a place, man
Fuck a petition when you're a man on a mission
This ain't 12 Years a Slave, it's twenty-six years a victim
I'll give you respect when you give us the time of day
Just an angry black man tryna find a way
[Chorus]
Everywhere I go
I'm looking for myself
And every day I pray
You keep all my family well, mmm
And everywhere I go
I'm looking for myself
And every day I pray
You keep all my family well

Sun appears behind the clouds
The last drops fall,and the arch in the sky
Paints the air in thousand colours

The boat, now still, is watching Asger
Sleeping rolled in the wet and torn sail
It drifts unsteered onto the Ocean
Borne towards its final destination

After the storm, the peace and quiet
Are only broken by the waves against the hull and
The last drops falling down onto Asger asleep
After the storm the sun is rising
Lighting up the sky, the ocean and the clouds
Far behind’s the night, far behind’s the storm

The sun is high, now forget the night
Forget the storm, for now it’s gone
You fought all night, now it’s all right
The currents will carry you to the Other Land
Don’t be afraid, for the ocean is quiet now
Its anger is gone, its wrath is forgotten
While you dream, Asger, your boat is guarded
His Hand will watch, the winds won’t rise again

After the storm, the peace and quiet
Are only broken by the waves against the hull and
The last drops falling down onto Asger asleep
After the storm the sun is rising
Lighting up the sky, the ocean and the clouds
Far behind’s the night, far behind’s the storm"

I can't serve you as you have me

The winter's passed and the leaves are green
The time has passed that we have seen
But still I hope the day will come
When you and I will be as one

I go to the clyde to mourn to weep
Unsatisfied, I never can sleep
So I write to you in a few short lines

Maybe I'm friggin' crazy
Can't control my emotions and making my vision hazy

With all these ignorant views you catch belligerent jolts from
But the world we live in is shocking
Make a man desperate and hungry, give him a shotgun
Expect him not to use it when failure isn't an option
I know he'd understand if this God is real and he's watching
God, if you're really listening, remove me from this wrath I'm in
Or help me use it musically, infuse it in my craft again
I havе learned some lеssons, but I burned the other half of them
I have earned redemption 'cause I keep on coming back again
Or maybe I'm gonna crack again from the pressure here
I feel my blood starting to boil, yeah, it gets severe
This is just a fucking trap, I don't see no exit here
I was looking for a sign, this seems like a message clear
Betrayal in my business, it's expensive, yeah
Bad energy is in the air, I sense it here
Looking back at the sequence of events this year
Seems to me that I gotta be relentless here
Those demons in my head, oh they're just tenants here
Drowning out my conscience, there's one in this ear - and in this ear
It's becoming clear, they're a cunning pair, running scared
Who's that knocking at my fucking door? Someone's there!

Maybe I'm freakin' losing it, pampered in my seclusion
And stranded in this confusion of fantasy and delusion
Intensified by brutality, probably leave a contusion
Desensitized to reality, rather see the illusion
Ain't nobody telling me nothing, this wrath is a cancer
They keep asking about my motives, I don't have any answer
But the question remains, derived through depression and pain
The destination stay the same but my direction is changed
God, if you're really listening, free me from all this pride I feel
Keep these demons away from me, creeping me while I try to heal
Help me to see the truth when these people around me lie and steal
Put the pieces together 'cause I been feeling divided still
Everywhere I turn up, feel like walls are closing in on me
But none of them are tall enough to hold in all this energy
The kid was only chosen for disposing of the enemy
Ironic that the mask I wear exposing my identity
Make a wish, you're gonna need it, now a mystery completed
I just paint a humble image, but the picture look conceited
Living in a vicious cycle, this is history repeated
Your opinion is a waste, here's permission to delete it
Put the smoke into my chest for all the post-traumatic stress
My expression not impressed, trynna focus on what's next
Always battling myself, it's like a constant war I'm in
Who the fuck is that? Somebody knocking at my door again

Now I'm half as high as I am low
That's just two other guys they call Wrath and Pride
Now I'm half as high as I am low
Two other guys they call Wrath and Pride
Now I'm half as high as I am low (Half as high as I am low)


[Outro: Slaine & Snak The Ripper]
On his way to wrath, on his way to pride
On his way to wrath, on his way to pride
On his way to wrath, on his way to pride
Everywhere I turn up, feel like walls are closing in on me"
5363,"What would you do if you were me? I caught a glimpse of what could be
I can't explain the way I feel, but I am certain that it’s real. It’s real
Forget tomorrow and love me now, abandoned dreams that that once belonged
There’s no more doubts inside my head tonight
When I didn't think that anything would ever turn out right
There’s something ‘bout July, she changed the scene all in one day
There’s something ‘bout July, I took to her right away
Something ‘bout July
Something wonderful about July
Just how all this has come to be, I don’t know how and I don’t know why, oh why?
I’m like a teenage driver at the lights, I just can’t wait, I just can’t wait to be movin’ on
Forget tomorrow and love me now, abandoned dreams that that once belonged
When I look back at the way it used to be
When I didn't think that anything would turn out right
I know it's only the beginning and time's not ever what it seems
Don’t want to shake this early feelin’, I feel that she is here to stay
July, July…
Something about that girl
July…
What would you do if you were me? Caught a glimpse of something that could be
Something about the way she makes me feel
She changed the scene all in one day
Something about her got me right away
Hey there girl listen…
Forget tomorrow and love me now"
7544,"[Verse 1: T-Rank]
Lo-fi the vocals, 'cause I'm about to go postal
We started coast to coast
But we're boutta count the totals
Smooth sailing since Sunoco
But a guy named Ganja Mon got us in loco
Parentis, class with Mrs. Serensits
Was the worst of my worries
But now I'm not in any hurry
All the cash I could ever need
Forget the IRS and their greed
It's still feeling like the world got their eyes on me
But just a few more miles, and then we're home free
And if things get bad we'll take a taxi cab
If we need to, for once I don't see nothing in rearview
He calls his studio the Lincoln Lab, sounds kinda drab
Like he named it on a passing fad
Is the Lincoln thing coincidence, or isn't it, I think it is
Pull off the freeway, the lab is in my sight
Boutta lay down some lyrics, 'cause I ain't looking for no fight
Put the car in neutral, then I see the flashing lights
Feel the old stress, green letters IRS
Gun it through the gap I swear they never forget
[Verse 2: Captain Zucc]
They're coming for the debt
Desean is sweating bullets, I'm looking
Head in his hands, we had our heads in the sand
Took the lead we had for granted if I'm being candid
The best outcome's that were stranded
After this, there's only one left standing

[Verse 3: AnDawg]
And we're swerving 'round the corner
Keep my fists gripped tight
'Cause I warn you, Zach is ready for a fistfight
Josh on the wheel and he's taking the next right
Tires on the street and they're slipping on thin ice
Try to grab the door but I fly through the dash
In the snow and ice and some broken glass
Look at the sign we hit, it said Lincoln Ave
Turn around we surrounded from front to back

[Verse 4: J-Had]
Circled now, red and blue in my eyes coming to
Got the wind knocked out me, thought we just finally through
One more wrench in the plan, now it's all looking gray
So far that we've ran but I knew we'd end up here
One day
[Verse 5: T-Rank]
Blood dripping down the side of my head, the taxmen emerge
I feel the dread, my heart pumping on the verge of life and death
My freedom at stake
Not a dollar to my name
I think I'm about to break
Owing 10k, and I ain't got one buck
But it's too late now to duck out
A judgment now
Try to speak but can't open my mouth
Taxman takes the papers out
Hole in my wallet is gaping now
I'm past saving
No cash in my savings account
He takes a calculator
Punching in the digits
We was about to cash some scratch-off tickets
Down the pavement and he's adding the payment
I get up, I'll hear the fee with honor
He turns and says

[Outro: T-Rank & Dan Van Antwerp]
Your total's ten dollars
What
Yeah, uh, there was an error in our system, we tacked three extra zeros on and so we overcharged you
So you need like 10 dollars? I won 10 bucks on a scratch-off ticket is that alright?
Yeah"

The universe in you, join the experience after all is done you will know

808,"There's a feeling of dread in the air once we draw near
Throughout every tavern, cove and town we've instilled the fear
No place to hide whilst still alive, we'll hunt ye down
Nothing is safe as we make haste just to see you drown

Your power of ale is destined to fail with no chance to prevail
So cower in your mail as the winds grace our sails, we'll drag you to hell

[Chorus]
As lightning cracks the sky, you're out of time
Thunder bellows loud, now you must die
On a quest for blood, we'll leave you ripped and torn
Your death awaits with no glorious fate
For we are the storm

With the slash of our sabers and a will to kill, heads will roll
We'll take your life, then your wife, and horde the loot we stole
No chance of survival, you're in denial, its all true
The pirates three will ruin your life then run you through

So you think you can drink while your shit don't stink
And try to hang with the happy little boozers
Well we got news for you, and it's always been true
You're just another worthless fucking loser
With praise of the hammer and your face all in paint
Do you really believe you're a warrior now?
The only battle you've seen is on a computer screen
If confrontation strikes, you hide like a coward
We'll put you in your place and leave you with disgrace
Steal your life like a band of crooks
So fuck the hammer and all its pathetic glamor
Now's the time for you to hail to the hook!"

When you crawl back on your feet...
They step on your fingers...
And you loose your grip again and again
I can't bear the loneliness anymore
I can't face my situation anymore...

I remember how time stood still
You were my lover my friend my joy
You were my life

How time has its way with things
And all the changes it brings - baby

If I could only say goodbye
There will always be a part of me for you
If I could find the reason why
If I could only say goodbye

I remember the day you walked out of my life
Thought the sorrow would never end
Then the tears came and all the joy
Was out of my life
Felt the heartbreak would never mend

Seems times like a stormy sea
Look what it's done to you and me - baby
If I could only say goodbye
There will always be a part of me for you
If I could find the reason why
If I could only say goodbye

Did we ever live a lie ?
Could I ever call you my friend ?
Will you always be a part of me ?
How can real love ever end ?

If I could only say goodbye
There will always be a part of me for you
If I could find the reason why
If I could only say goodbye

If I could only say goodbye
I know the love will never die

Mr. Hit-'Em-And-Never-Call-'Em-Back, a cold-hearted man
Hoping I can reach Tamika cause she down with all of that
Smack her ass, pull her hair, she love to get it from the back
Hit me with a text sayin' that she wanna sex me
I told her, ""Bring some lingerie"" if she wanna impress me
Bitch, fuck all that talking, just get over here and neck me
She started reachin' for the door like she offended by the joke
Settin' her bra down on her bed and started kissing on her throat
Getting closer to the pussy, ready to get in this shit
Pull her panties to the side, and bitch is on her period
Tell me you ain't serious, this shit is priceless
Told her, ""Get to sucking, bitch, and do it like you like it""
Dumbass broad is stupid but I wish I was a psychic
If I'd known she was bleedin' then she wouldn't have got invited
Got a nigga all excited, erectin' up my private

I know you trying to go and hope your pussy got some malice
I'm dead-ass serious, bitch I ain't smiling

I ain't trying to hear this shit
You ain't trying to suck the dick, then I'mma call the other bitch""

Playing like you had to do it when you know you ain't shit

Scrolling through these bitches like an iPod playlist
Ran across Jasmine, that redbone waitress
Ass like Trina with some lips like Megan
Good, classy broad but she still good
Layin' right under her man and I really wish she could
Come over and fuck me on my sofa
I'm almost out of options and I'm feelin' like it's over
For me to get some pussy cause it's almost a quarter to six and my
Hand in my dick, thinkin' about using my wrist
Pissed about this shit, I can't let it happen like this
Seen a call that I missed, and I hope that it's worth it
Hesitate to call her back cause she say she a virgin
But today you 'bout to learn how to bust that pussy open
I ain't jokin'

Heard a knock at the door, thankin' God like I'm spiritual
Hopin' that she wanna fuck, the situation critical
Gotta play my cards right and treat it like it's pivotal
Plus I'm drunk as hell and I'm a horny individual
Netflix on the couch, chillin' in the living room
Started kissing on her neck, she had the nerve to tell me move
I hit her with the stare face, ""bitch, what you tryna do?""
She told me she just wanna chill
I told her, ""oh, for real?
It's six o'clock in the morning, ho, and you know what it is
This ain't no talk-show, and you ain't look like Oprah
So hike that dress up like a sinner bitch and let me stroke ya""
I heard her suck her teeth, then she rolled the fuck over
Turned the TV off on her ass, hit her with the cold shoulder
This story far from over, and I am far from average
She say she practice abstinence, waitin' for the marriage
I told her ""let me eat the pussy, we ain't gotta have sex""
Stop right before she came, her legs still around my neck
Now her ass drippin' wet, fiendin' for a cigarette
Ask me if I had a rubber, all I could think was yes
Ran her tongue down my neck, started suckin' on my meat
""Tell me 'fore you 'bout to come so I can spit it in the sheets""
Hit her with the OK, but you know how I do and freak
Before you know it I'm bustin', jizzin' all on her teeth
She punch me in the stomach, she mad, I guess it's time to go
Walked her to the door and said peace and fell asleep

I try my best but i just can't get on my way
Try to lay the track straight down right here and now
Something's buzzing in my ear
It's all too loud
Most of all i feel, i fall
If i don't capture this feeling
Nothing coming down too smooth
For me this evening

Watch it crumble in my hands just like before
I'm gonna show technology who's boss
Once and for all
Feel it crumble in my hands just like it always will
It's either me or my laptop
But soon one gets killed

2992,"I walk around in this empty space
Surrounded by nothing (and everything that’s left)
No one ever seem to appear (not anymore)
Now that survival is the only way
To stay clear of the madness in this world
In this world

Fighting for what’s wrong
Keep in mind what is right
It makes no difference if I try or die
I’ve made my peace with this world
And so should you
So should you

Could this be the reason why
That feeling of belonging has gone
Where do I run to find a new beginning?
Because I’ll beg for the past to be undone

The tides ran wild so fast
I close my eyes when the sun rise
Retrace my steps till I find solid ground
This makes a beast of a man
I hate every second I give in
Weigh every word that I never gave a sound
I have everything at last
But the tides ran wild so fast"

Alone we innocents caught In Sin City

You could keep ya pitty
Cause I dont need the Shit
I been threw greviences
Jot down so much , my pens been inkless
Before I spat gold , It was sterling silver
Wish I couldve got my mom some ruby slippers fore' she passed
Drowing in my sorrows , feel like acid baths
Went from top of my class ,To not even in class
Skipping school getting high off grass, and selling hash
Thats Life for a nigga
Till Dreams and reality , become one for a nigga
White pickit fences , maybach engines
They wanna see me in that 6 by 8
With caged blues
Orange jump suits & White canvas shoes
Its my life I gotta Choose
Am I after Two Chains and tru's
Nah I want grammys linning my mansions living room
And my family too, tell em pick a room
I know these the days I'll Always remember
Bitches giving cold shoulders
Like its always december
Is that a 90's baby
The last of a dying breed
98 in fact , keep the Nickel plate in tact
So we could play attack
If we have tii
Fuck they shine, Ill take they shine
Drink they wine , Threw platinum lined faucets
How I spit heat , like bbq pits
See my gold mind , they like arent you rich
But we all got a bit of fools Gold
Number 1's looking like cocaine
Back when flows was cracked
Now they cocaine
I need a rope chain
And a record deal , Talking 2 mill
Re Up on that house , in the hills
All I want is to build , All I want is the bills"

But instead I changed myself, I let her go, biggest fuckin mistake
And now every bitch stares at me and think iem an asshole
Can't have a decent party without the fuckin extasy capsules
Because the alcohol brings my motherfuckin feelings out
And these bitches think that they help with the kneeling down
Its good for 15 minutes, then im back to the zero healin process
But im still happy – coz I love ma best
I met a girl on Monday, she was really sweet, a girlfriend material
I cheated on her on Tuesday,and now im worried if she knew it, its like a bacterial

Said I will meet you at the spire
At the highest point, at the top of the tallest tower
Up above the noise, I will drown it out, I will be louder
From across the void, I will answer when you call
I will give my all, I will be your strength, I will be your source of power
I will keep my light on while the city sleeps around us
Although all around is danger, I will keep you safe and sound
'Cause it’s only in the quiet, up so high above it all
That you realise just how small you are and how far you could fall

Take a look at what’s become of us (Become of us)

At the highest point, I will bear the weight
When you get tired, I will have no fear, in the hopes that you will have none either
In the darkest night, I will be your guiding light
I will keep you on your course, just keep me in your line of sight
Take my hand, hold on tight, I have got you in my grip
Don’t give up, don’t let go, I promise I won’t let you slip
Think how far we have climbed, now here we are, on the edge
Don’t look down, don’t be scared, just say my name and I’ll be there, because

Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow
Darling, I know

[Chorus: Björn, Benny, Agnetha & Frida]
We gotta have patience
Love isn't just a sensation
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Patience
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Love isn't just a sensation
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Some of the time it gets rough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
Giving
Love is a reason for living
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)
But a few things can be tough
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough
(Sweet, sweet, our love is bittersweet)"

Why do all the good ones taken all the time
Granny you left unexpected
Didn't had the time
Just to say that I love you
And to say that need you
Lil sis cried so much when she heard the news
Acting all tough acting like I didn't care
But deep inside my heart was so blank
Feelings gone tears gone everything was gone
Ever since you left everything is been to blur
You taught me to be a man you taught me never hit a girl
You showed the way the world doesn't care bout  human beings
I just wanna say thank you for the times we shared
Thank you for being there for me when I needed you grannygranny

Hook
Why do all the good ones taken all the time
And why do the bible say god is taking them Coz he loves em
Pains and wounds they be opening up
But as long as I know that granny you in a better place
A better place

Verse 2
Can't wait to see you face to face
In your better place
We both passed on the same day
Mine was based on school
But yours was based on life
Still remember heading to the new year with no fireworks
You always made sure that we got everything we need
We weren't rich but you made us feel so rich
Everybody loved you coz you had a open heart
Still wanna know why did god took you?
Coz I wanted you see me winning like I am now
But its cool as long as I know that you in a better place 
I just can't wait to see you face to face
Hold your hand tight squeeze it very very tight
Just to be honest granny I miss u
Never got a chance to tell you how much I love you
Imma big boy but I still need your lovin
Yeah I still need your lovin
You never ever judged me when I do the wrongs
Basically this Al' is for you and only you
I just hope that god is treating you nicely like Queen.Coz you always been my queen yeah my one and only queen

Hook
Why do all the good ones taken all the time
And why do the bible say god is taking them Coz he loves em
Pains and wounds they be opening up

6042,"Verse 1
Breaking news, they working with the Jews now
Let me introduce you to the true
Sound
Retro, how the truth sounds
Watch it, how they lose crowns
Hypo Hypothetical, lyrical, metaphorical, mystical Lines
They go political, hysterical, biblical fall like jericho to copy the lines
A world full of chaos
And the movers and the shakers
Controlling the papers
And the Evil coming like a bitch
Homecoming, this is pete
Gotta take it to the street
I'ma say it, this is strict
When you realise you rolling the dice
And losing lows for the highs
Wearing suits and ties
Preparing for the day you meet the most high
Power to the people
If your hours ain't legal
Don't you tryna be a prickle
'cos the pains don't tickle
When the government comes with the
Change
The suffering stuns and it's pains
Let me set it straight
It pains, pains
And it stings
Men of the night watch Little's
What their life's worth
Fighting in the bad war
Even when the fight's wrong
I remember the days when we shout for the good
But it's wrong these days, men fighting the truth
I see the cowardice in men and the politics in them
And you need to understand, the government is not your friend
We feeling powerless, hopeless
All the crap, nonsense
We on the fence men
Hook:
Contemporary system
Failing on the movement
Ordinary kinsmen
Working for the system
Contemporary failure
The government is failing us
We hating on the savvy us cos
We waiting for the saviour

Verse 2:
And the government is failing us
Contemporary failure
We working with the saints
Now Waiting for the saviour
Kinda how the holy does
We the kings, the men of the future
It depends, where the tools touch
Watching how the fools falls
Steady how the weak stalls
The noise of the silence crying
Like the Sirens
The power of the eye lens
Prying like the high sense
And the flames from the towers of the looters
Sending blames to the cowards
Acting luther
It's about time for the revolution
And the restitution of the demolition of the constitution
Power!
Power!
To the people
Me and you, we the people
God bless me, bless you
Martin luther king
Gat me feeling dreams
And I have a dream one day
This nation's gon be great
And the masses gon have a choice
When they gat a voice
And these amateur saboteurs
Crucified on the cross
In name of the people, the bereaved
And the Duped
I cast all the evils from within out the hood
Tell the false kings, we here for the throne
Living in a glass house, shouldn't throw stones
The classical vibe
Contemporary hype

8660,"I'm standing in the puddle that's formed
In the cracks in the sidewalk
In front of your apartment
How long have you lived here?
I didn't know you lived here
Until I saw you crying in your window
Why don't you just come down here
I know that you see me
I noticed you cry harder when I scream your name
It rains harder when I scream your name
My throat has gone numb
Because I've been screaming for days

Sorry about the last few text messages
They were kind of mean
Yeah I'll admit that they were kind of mean
I know that you hate yourself
And it's kind of on account of me
So I'm sorry

On the drive home
I'm holding back tears
I'm hold back tears and I'm pulling in smoke

A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping weltered cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknown to me
Ripping sacred vestments, veneral debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire

Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal, emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity, filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids

A lewdness flailing, enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration, serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable unborn

Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshyl folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love

This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene

Lascivious, that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery

4599,"Do you remember?
The way that we were, before you left on your own
Lover in a geranium dream
We walked down crimson coves

I stole a rose from the graveyard
I was scared, to give it to you
And I threw it away

In December
I stood in the garden and looked at the sun
Do you remember?
The things that we said, when we slept in your bed

Held you close to the sunrise
I was scared, you drifted away
As I touched your face

Lost inside of your world
Beyond your eyes
In the morning we rose"

[Vengeful Angel:]
I have come down from heaven, I bear the key to the pit
And with this great chain in my hand I shall lay hold on the dragon called Satan

[The Fallen Angel:]
Is this your justice? My divine damnation
If this is your wish then so be it, but my mind's still free
I'm still free

[Part II: Thorns Of Christ]

Wrath, pain and scorn, they rage within
I spoil your dreams of heaven with dreams of sin
So I was damned with hope betrayed
To crawl, repent and suffer - Yes, I was made

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!

Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene
Drag me down into the pit
For your self-destruction I must bleed
Churches of blood for crimson saints
My altar of damnation devoid of praise

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!

Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene

I am bound forever again
I am trapped to curse and fear your name
In a world of free will denied
Seeking for a cure to conquer Christ
I'll live when he has died

Nail the crown unto his head
Burn him at the cross to make sure he's dead
Ram in the spear, open his side
Lies of Hell and death fade with the crucified

Thorns in my side, the thorns of the saviour's pain!
Won't you save me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
Won't you free me now?
From the chains of the Nazarene
The chains of the Nazarene
Won't you save me now?

Tearful down like a river
River that gives me hope
This is my life
This is my fantasy
This is my passion
And it’s time to show myself
I just wanna be
Part of the music
And I can, I can, I can
And since i can, I will speak
For those who can’t"
8579,"The archaic and heavy words
From the stone age
Drag and lead me, to a mental city

Metropolis with streets, of rare smells
Where my steps become strange
And sounds are tiny

A place where titanium lips
Kiss and cover my skin
Crumpled by the flogging
Of a rending sensuality

A place where they created
Abraxas from ice and fire
And they believe only what
Their eyes see

It's a glass ball viewing the future
Like a witch vomiting a nasty past
And a wizard made of a lovely essence
Contaminates a wide and square mind
Sometimes when they find me there
I'm present but in a million places lost
Looking for colossal forces to build
The everlasting tears
I have never dropped

As the piano notes, sound like a poisonous fluid
This trip becomes sad, and fucking hard
Now the dream is not a quiet walk
It is a pyramidal nightmare that lifts me
To its zenith and throws me down
Because this false reality shows me
The reason I'm in this town
Because this false reality shows me
The reason I fell"

Spoken:
That's that fast Special Streamline
Leavin' outta Memphis, Tennessee
Goin' into New Orleans
She runnin' so fast the hobos don't
Fool with this train. They stand on the
Track with their hat in their hands

I had a friend girl that mornin' was
Catchin' that train
She got up singin' this song:

Sings:
'Hey Dad, I'm sorry to leave my home
Mm-mm-mm
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lordy'
Spoken:
She heard that 8:30 local blowin' that
Mornin'. She hadn't rid the train in a good while
She thought it'd have that Special Streamline
She heard at 8:30 local when she is comin'
To the line, declared up for that Streamline
Blowin' like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

She said, 'Daddy, is that my train?'
I say, I ain't keepin' up with the train time
I'm tryin-a make a few dimes.'
She dropped her head went to singin'
An cryin':

Sings:
'It's alright how you turn me down
Mm-mm-mm
I ain't got a dime

Spoken:
After she called for a ticket
She heard this Special Streamline
Going 36 miles from Memphis, Tennessee
Make ya lonesome now
Cause I hobo myself, sometimes
(plays guitar & w/wshbrd)

Man asks her, 'Where the other train?'
She told him she didn't know

If she heard a bell she could tell him all about it
As she dropped over that hill
And stopped off in the valley
She heard the bell begin to toll like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)
'Make a sound like a church bell toll'

Before she got to that ten mile tunnel
She blowed and throw'd on the airbrakes

(plays guitar & w/wshbrd)

Airbrakes!

When she got to that ten mile tunnel
She was gettin' close
She was tippin cars on automatic switch
Gettin' her water and coal on the fly
You could hear her when she was strikin'
That double iron like this:
(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

When she run 'cross the last one
She squalled in

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

This girl looked out an seen that train
She commenced to singin' an cryin'

Sings:
'Hey, dad I don't wanna leave'
Mm-mm
I believe I'll lose my mind'

When that train got a little closer
Down to New Orleans, she went around
That curve, you would hear her
When she's blowin' like this:

(plays guitar w/wshbrd)

The people's always standin' at the station
Lyin' there to see that train come in
You would hear her when she squalls

(plays guitar w/wshbrd - to end)

Spoken:

'Boy, ev'rywhere but here'

Gimme back my diary
Gimme back that side of me
I’m a lonely poet and I lost myself entirely
My whole life, it fell apart, I fucked up undeniably
Don’t look up to me, I’m just a loser, don’t admire me

[Verse]
Sadness and addiction, all this darkness is a part of me
My heart broke a thousand times, there's cracks on all my arteries
Shoutout to my love and then she ran off like a robbery
It’s too late to save me so just save me your apologies
Everything I spit is real for real, I’m not a wanna-bе
Flyin’ in a PJ on my head is an economy
They don’t undеrstand, nobody let me, I’m a prodigy
I’m drownin’ in this money and it’s blowin’ on this quantity
I feel like myself again when I’m smokin' this broccoli
I go up to the stars cause I am one like astronomy
I got shooters on my team, but don’t say cheese, it’s not photography
These bullets make ‘em do the runnin' man, no choreography
Now I got a voice so I'ma use it irresponsibly
Now they got no choice, if you don’t like me, don’t respond to me
All designer on me, I look like I hit the lottery
But all this money doesn’t mean a thing if you don’t ride for me

Gimme back my diary
Gimme back that side of me

That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear
And Grace my fears relieved
How precious did that Grace appear

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me
His Word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be

We've no less days to sing God's praise

If I knew, just a little loophole I would squeeze myself right through

There'll be no suitcases just a slight smile on my lips
That indicates a sense of being free

But if you wanna change your mind, join the ride, ride

I keep it moving while others don't
They just keep back and settle like a stone
And they're comfortable while I am like oooohweee no

Moving through the night

And she`s standing in the corner
But she`s a little but shy
She needs some coaxing on the dance floor

But pretty soon
She caught his eye
Now he`s moving in
Beauty`s shy
But in her eyes
She starts his head to spin
He keeps up all the dancing
Starts them both to swing
Now they`re getting to a good thing

4053,"Booth went to the doctor’s lodgings, and found him engaged with his country friend and his son, a young gentleman who was lately in orders; both whom the doctor had left, to keep his appointment with Amelia.

After what we mentioned at the end of the last chapter, we need take little notice of the apology made by Booth, or the doctor’s reception of it, which was in his peculiar manner. “Your wife,” said he, “is a vain hussy to think herself worth my anger; but tell her I have the vanity myself to think I cannot be angry without a better cause. And yet tell her I intend to punish her for her levity; for, if you go abroad, I have determined to take her down with me into the country, and make her do penance there till you return.”

“Dear sir,” said Booth, “I know not how to thank you if you are in earnest.”

“I assure you then I am in earnest,” cries the doctor; “but you need not thank me, however, since you know not how.”

“But would not that, sir,” said Booth, “be shewing a slight to the colonel’s invitation? and you know I have so many obligations to him.”

“Don’t tell me of the colonel,” cries the doctor; “the church is to be first served. Besides, sir, I have priority of right, even to you yourself. You stole my little lamb from me; for I was her first love.”

“Well, sir,” cries Booth, “if I should be so unhappy to leave her to any one, she must herself determine; and, I believe, it will not be difficult to guess where her choice will fall; for of all men, next to her husband, I believe, none can contend with Dr Harrison in her favour.”

“Since you say so,” cries the doctor, “fetch her hither to dinner with us; for I am at least so good a Christian to love those that love me—I will shew you my daughter, my old friend, for I am really proud of her—and you may bring my grand-children with you if you please.”

Booth made some compliments, and then went on his errand. As soon as he was gone the old gentleman said to the doctor, “Pray, my good friend, what daughter is this of yours? I never so much as heard that you was married.”

“And what then,” cries the doctor; “did you ever hear that a pope was married? and yet some of them have had sons and daughters, I believe; but, however, this young gentleman will absolve me without obliging me to penance.”

“I have not yet that power,” answered the young clergyman; “for I am only in deacon’s orders.”
“Are you not?” cries the doctor; “why then I will absolve myself. You are to know then, my good friend, that this young lady was the daughter of a neighbour of mine, who is since dead, and whose sins I hope are forgiven; for she had too much to answer for on her child’s account. Her father was my intimate acquaintance and friend; a worthier man, indeed, I believe never lived. He died suddenly when his children were infants; and, perhaps, to the suddenness of his death it was owing that he did not recommend any care of them to me. However, I, in some measure, took that charge upon me; and particularly of her whom I call my daughter. Indeed, as she grew up she discovered so many good qualities that she wanted not the remembrance of her father’s merit to recommend her. I do her no more than justice when I say she is one of the best creatures I ever knew. She hath a sweetness of temper, a generosity of spirit, an openness of heart—in a word, she hath a true Christian disposition. I may call her an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.”

“I wish you joy of your daughter,” cries the old gentleman; “for to a man of your disposition, to find out an adequate object of your benevolence, is, I acknowledge, to find a treasure.”

“It is, indeed, a happiness,” cries the doctor.

“The greatest difficulty,” added the gentleman, “which persons of your turn of mind meet with, is in finding proper objects of their goodness; for nothing sure can be more irksome to a generous mind, than to discover that it hath thrown away all its good offices on a soil that bears no other fruit than ingratitude.”

“I remember,” cries the doctor, “Phocylides saith,

Mn kakov ev epens opens dpelpelv ioov eot evi povtw

But he speaks more like a philosopher than a Christian. I am more pleased with a French writer, one of the best, indeed, that I ever read, who blames men for lamenting the ill return which is so often made to the best offices. {Footnote: D’Esprit.} A true Christian can never be disappointed if he doth not receive his reward in this world; the labourer might as well complain that he is not paid his hire in the middle of the day.”

“I own, indeed,” said the gentleman, “if we see it in that light—”

“And in what light should we see it?” answered the doctor. “Are we like Agrippa, only almost Christians? or, is Christianity a matter of bare theory, and not a rule for our practice?”

“Practical, undoubtedly; undoubtedly practical,” cries the gentleman. “Your example might indeed have convinced me long ago that we ought to do good to every one.”

“Pardon me, father,” cries the young divine, “that is rather a heathenish than a Christian doctrine. Homer, I remember, introduces in his Iliad one Axylus, of whom he says—

—Hidvos o’nv avopwpoloi
pavras yap tyeeokev

But Plato, who, of all the heathens, came nearest to the Christian philosophy, condemned this as impious doctrine; so Eustathius tells us, folio 474.”
“I know he doth,” cries the doctor, “and so Barnes tells us, in his note upon the place; but if you remember the rest of the quotation as well as you do that from Eustathius, you might have added the observation which Mr. Dryden makes in favour of this passage, that he found not in all the Latin authors, so admirable an instance of extensive humanity. You might have likewise remembered the noble sentiment with which Mr. Barnes ends his note, the sense of which is taken from the fifth chapter of Matthew:—

“It seems, therefore, as if this character rather became a Christian than a heathen, for Homer could not have transcribed it from any of his deities. Whom is it, therefore, we imitate by such extensive benevolence?”

“What a prodigious memory you have!” cries the old gentleman: “indeed, son, you must not contend with the doctor in these matters.”

“I shall not give my opinion hastily,” cries the son. “I know, again, what Mr. Poole, in his annotations, says on that verse of St Matthew—That it is only to heap coals of fire upon their heads. How are we to understand, pray, the text immediately preceding?—Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you.”

“You know, I suppose, young gentleman,” said the doctor, “how these words are generally understood. The commentator you mention, I think, tells us that love is not here to be taken in the strict sense, so as to signify the complacency of the heart; you may hate your enemies as God’s enemies, and seek due revenge of them for his honour; and, for your own sakes too, you may seek moderate satisfaction of them; but then you are to love them with a love consistent with these things; that is to say, in plainer words, you are to love them and hate them, and bless and curse, and do them good and mischief.”

“Excellent! admirable!” said the old gentleman; “you have a most inimitable turn to ridicule.”

“I do not approve ridicule,” said the son, “on such subjects.”

“Nor I neither,” cries the doctor; “I will give you my opinion, therefore, very seriously. The two verses taken together, contain a very positive precept, delivered in the plainest words, and yet illustrated by the clearest instance in the conduct of the Supreme Being; and lastly, the practice of this precept is most nobly enforced by the reward annexed—that ye may be the children, and so forth. No man who understands what it is to love, and to bless, and to do good, can mistake the meaning. But if they required any comment, the Scripture itself affords enow. If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing. They do not, indeed, want the comments of men, who, when they cannot bend their mind to the obedience of Scripture, are desirous to wrest Scripture to a compliance with their own inclinations.”

“Most nobly and justly observed,” cries the old gentleman. “Indeed, my good friend, you have explained the text with the utmost perspicuity.”

“But if this be the meaning,” cries the son, “there must be an end of all law and justice, for I do not see how any man can prosecute his enemy in a court of justice.”

“Pardon me, sir,” cries the doctor. “Indeed, as an enemy merely, and from a spirit of revenge, he cannot, and he ought not to prosecute him; but as an offender against the laws of his country he may, and it is his duty so to do. Is there any spirit of revenge in the magistrates or officers of justice when they punish criminals? Why do such, ordinarily I mean, concern themselves in inflicting punishments, but because it is their duty? and why may not a private man deliver an offender into the hands of justice, from the same laudable motive? Revenge, indeed, of all kinds is strictly prohibited; wherefore, as we are not to execute it with our own hands, so neither are we to make use of the law as the instrument of private malice, and to worry each other with inveteracy and rancour. And where is the great difficulty in obeying this wise, this generous, this noble precept? If revenge be, as a certain divine, not greatly to his honour, calls it, the most luscious morsel the devil ever dropt into the mouth of a sinner, it must be allowed at least to cost us often extremely dear. It is a dainty, if indeed it be one, which we come at with great inquietude, with great difficulty, and with great danger. However pleasant it may be to the palate while we are feeding on it, it is sure to leave a bitter relish behind it; and so far, indeed, it may be called a luscious morsel, that the most greedy appetites are soon glutted, and the most eager longing for it is soon turned into loathing and repentance. I allow there is something tempting in its outward appearance, but it is like the beautiful colour of some poisons, from which, however they may attract our eyes, a regard to our own welfare commands us to abstain. And this is an abstinence to which wisdom alone, without any Divine command, hath been often found adequate, with instances of which the Greek and Latin authors everywhere abound. May not a Christian, therefore, be well ashamed of making a stumbling-block of a precept, which is not only consistent with his worldly interest, but to which so noble an incentive is proposed?”

The old gentleman fell into raptures at this speech, and, after making many compliments to the doctor upon it, he turned to his son, and told him he had an opportunity now of learning more in one day than he had learnt at the university in a twelvemonth.

The son replied, that he allowed the doctrine to be extremely good in general, and that he agreed with the greater part; “but I must make a distinction,” said he. However, he was interrupted from his distinction at present, for now Booth returned with Amelia and the children."
3302,"The following transcript is adapted from an interview that took place in the visitor’s lounge at the St. Tekawitha Retirement Community in Spokane, Washington, on February 28, 2052:

Q: Hello, I’m going to record this, that is, if that’s okay with you? Is that okay?
A: Yes.
Q: Good, good. So, would you, could we begin, could you please begin by stating your name, your birth date, your age, where you were born, and that’s it.
A: You first.
Q: Excuse me?
A: You should tell me who you are first. That’s the polite way.
Q: Oh, okay, I suppose you’re correct. I’m Spencer Cox, born July 7, 2007, in old Los Angeles. I’m forty-five years old. Okay? Is that okay?
A: Yes, that’s good. IT’s nice to meet you.
Q: Yes, it’s my pleasure.
(ten seconds of silence)
Q: And?
A: And?
Q: Would you like to introduce yourself?
A: Yes.
(fifteen words of silence)
Q: Well, possibly you could do it now? If you please?
A: My name is Etta Joseph. I was born in Wellpinit, Washington, on the Spokane Indian Reservation on Christmas Day, 1934. I am one hundred and eighteen years old and I am the Last of the Spokane Indians.
Q: Really? I had no idea you were the last.
A: Well, actually, I’m not. There are thousands of us. But it sounds more romantic, enit?
Q: Yes, very amusing. Irony, a hallmark of the contemporary indigenous American. Good, good. Yes. So, perhaps we could officially begin by…
A: Spencer, what exactly is it you do?
Q: I’m a cultural anthropologist. An anthropologist is …
A: I know what an anthropologist is.
Q: Yes, yes, of course you do. As I was saying, I am a cultural anthropologist and the Owens Lecturer in Applied Indigenous Studies at Harvard University. I’m also the author of seventeen books, texts, focusing on mid- to late-twentieth-century Native American culture, most specifically the Interior Salish tribes of Washington State.
( twenty seconds of silence)
Q: So, Miss Joseph, can I call you Etta?
A: No.
Q: Oh, I see, okay. Formality. Yes, quite another hallmark of the indigenous. Ceremony and all. I Understand. I’m honored to be included. So, Miss Joseph, perhaps we could begin, I mean, could I ask an introductory question? Yes. Well, let’s see, you have been a traditional powwow dancer for the last eighty years, In that time, how has the powwow changed? Of course, the contemporary powwow is not a sacred ceremony, not as we have come to understand it, but rather a series of pan-Indian ceremonies whose influences include many tribal cultures and popular American culture as well, but I was wondering how you …
A: Why are you really here?
Q: Well, I was trying to get into that. I wanted to talk about dance and the Indian…
A: You’re here about John Wayne, enit?
Q: Excuse me?
A: You came here to talk about John Wayne.
Q: Well, no, but the John Wayne mythology certainly plays an important role in the shaping of twentieth-century American and Native American culture, but…
A: Have you ever seen a John Wayne movie?
Q: Yes, yes, I have. Most of them, in fact. I was quite the little cowboy when I was a child. Had two Red Ryder six-shooter pistols. They shot these little silver pellets. I recall that I killed a squirrel. I was quite shocked. I had no idea the pellets were dangerous, but I suppose that’s beside the point. Now, back to dance…
A: I used to be an actress.
Q: Really? Well, let’s see here, I don’t recall reading about that in your file.
A: What are you doing?
Q: Well, I’m reading through your file, your profile here, the pre-interview, some excellent books regarding your tribe, and a few texts transcribed directly from the Spokane Tribe oral tradition, which I must say, are quite..
A:  Just pout those papers away. And those books. What is it with you white people and your books?
Q: I’m afraid I don’t understand.
A: How come you love books so much?
Q: As my mother used to say, they’re the keys to the locked doors of the house of wisdom.
A: Did your mother really say that?
Q: Well, no.
A: So, then, it’s a lie? You jut told me a lie?
Q: Yes, yes, I suppose I did.
A: It’s a good lie. Charming even. Attributing one of yout faintly amusing and fairly poetic lines to your own mother. You must love her quite a bit.
Q: Oh. Well, I don’t know how to respond to that.
A: Are you a liar?
Q: What do you mean?
A: Do you tell lies?
Q: Everybody tells lies. I mean, occasionally.
A: That’s not what I asked you.
Q: Yes, I tell lies. But I hardly think of myself as a liar.
(twenty-seven seconds of silence)
Q: Okay, so perhaps I am a liar, but not all the time.
(twenty-two seconds of silence)
Q: Why exactly are you calling me a liar?
A: I haven’t called you anything.
Q: But you accused me of lying.
A: No, I asked you if you were lying and you said yes. So I think that means you accused yourself of being a liar. Good observation, by the way.
Q: What’s the point of all this?
A: I’m having fun with you.
Q: Well, if you’re not going to take this seriously, I’m afraid I might have to move on. My time is valuable.
A: Having fun is very serious.
Q: I hardly think a few jokes are serious. I am currently working on a serious and profound study on the effect of classical European ballroom dancing on the indigenous powwow—a revolutionary text, by the way—so I don’t have time for a lonely woman’s jests and insults.
A: You have a lot to learn. You should listen more and talk less.
Q: Pardon me. I think I’ll leave now.
A: I’m no lonely. Have a good day.
(ten seconds of silence)
Q: Okay, wait, I think I understand. We were participating in a tribal dialogue, weren’t we? That sort of confrontational banter which solidifies familial and tribal ties, weren’t we? Oh, how fascinating, and I failed to recognize it.
A: What re you talking about?
Q: Well, confrontational banter has always been a cultural mainstay of indigenous cultures. In its African form, it becomes the tribal rite they call “doing the dozens.” You know, momma jokes? Like, your mother is so fat, when she broke her leg gravy poured out. It’s all part of the oral tradition. And here I was being insulted by you, and I didn’t recognize it as an integral and quite lovely component of the oral tradition. Of course you had to insult me. It’s your tradition.
A: Oh, stop it, just stop it. Don’t give me that oral tradition garbage. It’s so primitive. It makes it sound like Indians sit around naked and grunt stories at each other. Those books about Indians, those texts you love so much, where do you think they come from?
Q: Well, certainly, all written language has its roots in the oral tradition, but I fail…
A: No, no, no, those books started with somebody’s lie. Then some more lies were piled on top of that, until you had a whole book filled with lies, and then somebody slapped an Edward Curtis photograph on the cover, and called it good.
Q: These books of lies, as you call them, are the definitive texts on the Interior Salish.
A: No, there’s nothing definitive about them. They’re just your oral tradition. And they’re filled with the same lies, exaggerations, mistakes, and ignorance as our oral traditions.
Q: Have you ever read these books?
A: I’ve read all of your books. You show me a book written by a white man about Indians and I’ve read it. You show me almost any book, any of your so-called Great Books, and I’ve read them. Hemingway, Faulkner, Conrad. Read them all. Austen, Kafka, James, read them. Whitman, Dickinson, Donne. Read them. We head over to this university or that college, to your Harvard, and grab their list of required reads, and I’ve read them. Hundreds of your books, your white-man books, thousands of them. I’ve read them all.
Q: And what is your point in telling me this?
A: I know so much more about you than you will ever know about me.
Q: Miss Joseph, I am a leading authority, no, I am the, the, the leading authority in the field…
A: Mr. Cox, Spenser. For the last one hundred and eighteen years, I have lived in your world, your white world. In order to survive, to thrive, I have to be white for fifty-seven minutes of every hour.
Q: How about the other three minutes?
A: That, sir, is when I get to be Indian, and you have no idea, no concept, no possible way of knowing what happens in those three minutes.
Q: Then tell me. That’s what I am here for.
A: Oh, no, no, no. Those three minutes belong to us. They are very secret. You’ve colonized Indian land but I am not about to let you colonize my heart and mind.
Q: Tell me then. Why are you here? Why did you consent to this interview? What do you have to tell me that could possibly help me with me work? You, you are speaking political nonsense. Colonialism. That’s the tired mantra of liberals who’ve run out of intellectual imagination. I am here to engage in a free exchange of ideas, and you’re here, you want to inject politics into this. I will have no part of it.
A: I lost my virginity to John Wayne.
(forty-nine seconds of silence)
Q: You’re speaking metaphorically, of course.
A: Spencer, I am speaking of the vagina and the penis.
Q: As metaphors?
A: Do you know the movie The Searchers?
Q: The Western? Directed by John Ford? Yes, yes, quite well, actually. Released in 1956, I believe.
A: 1952.
Q: No, no, I’m quite sure it was 1956.
A: You’re quite sure of a lot of things and you’re quite wrong about a lot of them, too.
(five seconds of silence)
Q: Well, I do know The Searchers. Wayne plays Ethan Edwards, the ex-Confederate soldier who sets out to find his niece, played by Natalie Wood. She’s been captured by the Camanches who massacred Ethan’s family. Along with Jeffery Hunter, who plays a half-breed Cherokee, of all things! Wayne will not surrender to hunger, thirst, snow, heat, or loneliness in his quest, his search. A quite brilliant film.
A: Enough with that academic crap. Listen to me. Listen carefully. In 1952, in Kayenta, Arizona, while John Wayne was playing Ethan Edwards, and I was playing a Navajo extra, we fell in love. Him, for the first and only time with an Indian. Me, for the first time with anybody.
“My real name is Marion,” said John Wayne as he slid the condom over his erect penis. His hands were shaking, making it nearly impossible to him to properly fit the condom, so Etta Joseph reached down, smoother the rubber with the palm of her left hand—she was touching John Wayne—and then guided him inside of her. He made love carefully, with an unintentional tantric rhythm: three shallow thrusts followed by one deep thrust, repeat as necessary.
“Does it hurt?” asked John Wayne, with genuine concern, and not because he was arrogant about being her first lover.
“It’s okay,” said Etta, but it did hurt him. It hurt a lot. She wondered why people were so crazy about this act. But still, she was making love to John Wayne.
“Oh, oh, John Wayne,” she moaned. She felt uncomfortable, silly, like a bad actress in a bad love scene.
“Call me Marion,” He said between thrusts. “My real name is Marion. Call me Marion.”
“Marion, Marion, Marion,” she whispered.
They laid together on a Pendleton blanket on the red sand of the Navajo Monument Valley. All around them, the impossible mesas. Above them, the most stars either of them had ever seen.
“I love you, I love you,” he said as he kissed her face, neck, breasts. His lips were thin, his face rough with three days of beard.
“Oh,” she said, surprised by his words, even frightened. How could he be in love with her? He didn’t even know her. She was just an eighteen-year-old Spokane Indian woman—a girl—a thousand miles away from home, from her reservation. She was not in Navajo land by accident—she was an actress, after all—but she hadn’t planned on lying beneath John Wayne—Marion!—as he confessed his love, his impossible love for her.
Three days earlier, she’d been an extra in the Navajo camp when John Wayne and Jeffery Hunter traded blankets, hates, and secrets with the Navajo chief. Etta hadn’t had any lines. She’d only been set dressing, a pretty girl in a purple dress. But she’d been proud and she was sure to be on camera because John Ford told her so.
“Girl,” Ford had said, “You are as pretty as the mesa.”
For just a moment, Etta had wondered if Ford might cast her then and there for a speaking role, perhaps even give her the role of Look, the chubby daughter of the Navajo chief, and send the other Indian women packing. Of course not! But Etta had wished for it, however briefly, and had chided herself for her ambition. She’d wished ill will on another Indian woman just because a white man had called her pretty. Desperate and shallow, of course, but Etta had not been able to help herself.
This was John Ford! He was not handsome, no, but he was a Hollywood director. He made dreams come true. He was the one who filled the movie screens with the movies! He was a magician! He was a feature film director and she knew they were the kindest and most decent men in the world.
“Stand here,” Ford had directed Etta. “Right here, so the audience can see your lovely face in the background here. Right between Jeffrey and the Duke.” She had not been able to contain her excitement. Five feet, away, John Wayne was smoking a cigarette. John Wayne! But more than that, it had been Jeffery Hunter who’d captured her imagination. He was a beautiful boy, with dark hair, brown skin, and those blue, blue eyes. John Wayne might have been a movie star—and a relatively homely one at that—but Jeffery Hunter was simply the most gorgeous white man on the planet. But here he was playing an Indian, a half-breed Cherokee, so perhaps Jeffery himself was part Indian. After all, Etta had thought, why would they cast a white man as an Indian if he didn’t have some Indian blood himself? Otherwise, the movie would have been a lie, and John Wayne didn’t lie. And judging by the kindness in his eyes, by the graceful turn oh his spine, by the way he waved his sensuous hands when he talked, Jeffery Hunter was no liar either.
Anyway, they’d filmed the scene, a funny one where Jeffery Hunter had inadvertently traded a hat for a Navajo wife, for Look—how positively amusing!—and all the while, Etta had looked on and wished that Jeffery Hunter had traded for her. Not Jeffery Hunter the actor in the scene, but Jeffery Hunter the blue-eyed man.
“Mr. Hunter, you were wonderful,” She’d said when she’d approached him after the scene.
Without a word to her, he’d turn and walked away. She’d admired his silence, his commitment to his craft. He hadn’t wanted to be distracted by the shallow attentions of some Indian girl other than Look. Still. Her feelings had been hurt and there might have been a tear in her eye when John Wayne sidled up close to her—yes, sidled—and shook his head.
“I don’t understand actors,” the Duke had said. “It’s the audience that matters, and yet, so often, we shun them.”
“What does shun mean?” she asked.
“Exactly. I mean, how can we, as actors, get close to the soul, to our hearts, if we don’t look deeply into the soul and hearts of others? In the end, how can wee fragile human beings possibly by sympathetic actors if we don’t refuse to show sympathy for other people’s emotions? How can we realistically project love, hope, and faith if we are not loving, hopeful, and faithful ourselves?”
“That’s beautiful.”
“Yes, yes. If we don’t feel it in here, in our chest, then the audience will never feel it in their hearts.”
“That’s why I act,” she said.
“Hello, my name is John Wayne.”
“I’m Etta Joseph.”
Now, three days after Jeffery Hunter had walked away from her, Etta was naked with John Wayne.
“I love you, I love you,” he whispered to her. He was gentle with her, of course, but he was strong as well. He rolled onto his back and lifted her, then lowered her down onto him. His penis was huge! It was a movie star’s penis, for sure. Etta had never really thought about John Wayne’s penis before. She’d never really thought abut any man’s or actor’s penis before. Sure, she’d felt strong desires for men, sexual desires, but they’d always taken the form of vague shapes and sizes inside of her body. She’d never imagined what John Wayne would look like naked, but there he was! Strong arms, long legs, a pot belly. As he lay beneath her, as he closed his eyes, Etta wondered what she should do with her hands. Nobody had ever taught her how to do this, how to make love to a man. And it was John Wayne, so he must have made love to a thousand different women in his life. Other movie stars! He must have made love to Bette Davis, Vivien Leigh, Greta Garbo, Grace Kelly, maybe even Judy Garland. All those perfect women. Etta felt small and terrified in the presence of John Wayne.
“What’s wrong?” he asked.
“I’m afraid.”
“If you get pregnant, I’ll take care of it.”
In the rush, she’d never even thought about pregnancy. How stupid! She was only eighteen years old, unmarried, a thousand miles away from home. What would she do with a baby? And what did he mean by taking care of it? Did he want to marry her, be the husband of an Indian woman and the father of an Indian child, or did he want her to have an abortion? God, she’d heard about abortions, how they reached inside of you with a metal hook and scraped out all of your woman parts. In terror, she rolled away from John Wayne and ran naked through the desert, toward the lights of the distant set, where John Ford and Jeffery Hunter were sure to have the answers to all of her questions.
“Wait, wait, wait,” cried John Wayne as he chased after her. He was not a young man. He wondered if he could possibly catch her. But she was a child of the river and pine tree, of wild grass and mountain. She understood gravity in a different way and, therefore, tripped in the rough sands of the desert. She fell face first into the red dirt and waited for John Wayne to catch and hurt her. Isn’t that what he had always done? Wasn’t he the man who killed Indians?
“Etta, Etta.” He kneeled beside her. He stroked her long black hair. She flinched and pushed him away.
“Go away, go away, John Wayne,” she cried out.
“Oh, Etta, I’m not going to hurt you,” he said. “I couldn’t hurt you. I love you.”
“But you can’t love me. You don’t even know me.”
John Wayne wept.
There, in Navajo Monument Valley, John Wayne wept. His tears fell to the sand and flooded the desert.
“Nobody knows me,” he cried. “Nobody knows me.”
He was so afraid! Etta was shocked into silence. This was the great John Wayne and he was afraid.
“But, but, but,” Etta Stammered. “But you’re a star.”
“John Wayne is the star. I’m Marion, I’m just Marion Morrison.”
She held him for a good long time.
Q: I can’t believe this. Are you telling me the truth>
A: Yes, as far as I can remember it.
Q: This is not a lie, one of those good lies you were talking about?
A: Spencer, I was fooling you. There’s no such thing as a good lie.
Q: Bad lies, good lies, whatever. Just tell me the truth. Did you really lose your virginity to John Wayne?
(seven seconds of silence)
A: He was afraid of horses, did you know that?
Q: John Wayne afraid of horses? That’s completely implausible. I mean, I’d sooner believe that you slept with him. We’re talking about John Wayne here.
A: When he was seven years old, a horse kicked him in the head. He was in a coma for nearly three months. Everybody through he was going to die. In the hospital, his mother brought in a catholic priest to baptize him. His father brought in a Presbyterian priest for last rites. They thought he was going to die. They were sure he was going to die.
Q: I don’t recall reading any of this about John Wayne. Kicked in the head by a horse? That must be urban legend.
A: He showed me the scar. Just behind his right ear. About five inches long. They hid it with makeup. The horse’s name was Rooster. He liked me to kiss it whenever we made love.
Q: Wait, wait, wait, he liked you to kiss the horse?
A: Oh, no, no, no, silly. He liked me to kiss his scar. He said it was really sensitive, still, after all those years. He was really a sensitive man, you know? He knew how to cry. He cried every time we made love. Well, this is really embarrassing, but he cried every time he had, every time, he, well, you know, had an orgasm.
Q: Wait, wait, wait, what are you telling me? How many times did you make love?
A: Most every night during the filming of the movie. Except for those nights when his wife and kids came to visit.
Q: So, hold on here, let me get my head around this. Not only were you having sex with John Wayne, you were also having an affair with him?
A: I’m not proud of that particular nature of our relationship, but yes, John Wayne was a married man.

In Navajo Monument Valley, during a long day of filming, John Wayne stepped into the makeup trailer for a touch-up and discovered his sons happily covering their faces with lipstick and mascara.
“Well, hello there,” John Wayne said to his sons.
“They were petrified, afraid of this large man, this male.
“Are you having fun?” the Duke asked his sons.
They didn’t know how to answer. If they said no, they’d be lying, and their father always knew when they were lying. If they said yes, well, then, that could mean all sort of things, and all of them were bad.
“Are you having gun?” he asked again. His faced revealed nothing, his thin mouth was closed tight, his teeth were hidden behind that weathered face.
The eldest son cried, so the youngest son decided to join him.
“Wait, wait, wait,” said John Wayne. “What’s with all of these tears?”
“You hate us,” cried the oldest boy.
“Don’t hate me, don’t hate me,” cried the youngest boy. John Wayne scooped up his boys. He set his big cowboy hat on the youngest boy’s head.
“I don’t hate you, I could never hate you,” said John Wayne. “What makes you think I hate you?”
“Because we’re girls,” wailed the boys.
John Wayne held his sons and stroked their hair.
“Oh, there, there, you’re not girls, you’re not girls,” said the father. “What makes you think you’re girls?”
“Because we’re putting on lipstick,” said the youngest.
John Wayne laughed.
“Oh, sons, you’re just engaging in some harmless gender play. Some sexual experimentation. Every boy does this kind of thing. Every man likes to pretend he’s a woman now and again. It’s very healthy.”
“Daddy,” said the oldest. “Do you dress up like a woman?”
“Well, I don’t put on a dress or anything. But I often close my eyes and try to put myself into a woman’s shoes. I try to think like a woman. I try to embrace the feminine in myself. Do you know what I mean?”
“No,” said the boys.
“Well, sons, let me tell you the honest truth. There’s really not that much different between men and women. In all things, intelligence, passion, hope, dreams, strength, men and women are pretty much equals. I mean, gender is mostly a social construction. After all, males and females share about ninety-nine percent of the same genetic material. So, given that, how could we really be that much different? In fact, we’re all so much alike that every woman must have some masculine inside of her and every man must have feminine inside of him. You just ain’t a whole person otherwise.”
“Daddy!” shouted the boys. They were shocked. “That’s not what you said before when you were on the radio and television.”
“Boys, I know. I know. I have a public image to maintain. But that’s not who I really am. I may act like a cowboy, I might pretend to be a cowboy, but I am not a cowboy in real life, do you understand?”
“I think so,” said the oldest son. “Is it like in school, when you’re supposed to be listening to the teacher, but you’re only pretending to listen so you don’t get in trouble?”
John Wayne smiled.
“Yes, yes, it’s something like that,” he said to his sons. “Now, let me teach you a little something about the birds and bees. If you want to make a woman happy, really happy, there’s only one thing you got to do.”
“What, Daddy, what?”
“Listen to her stories.”
Q: So, what happened, I mean, what did you do when his wife and sons came to visit?
A: I felt bad, bad, bad. That John Wayne, he was a good father and a good husband, too. I mean, he was cheating on them, that’s for sure, but he wasn’t going to leave them. No way. All the time he and I were together, he just kept telling me the same thing. “I ain’t leaving them,” he’d say. “I ain’t leaving them. I am a good man, and a good man ain’t a  good man without a good family.”
Q: But how do you reconcile that? How did he reconcile that? How can a man claim to love his wife and children if he’s sleeping, if he’s in love with another woman?
A: Are you married, Spencer?
Q: No.
A: Kids?
Q: No.
A: Then you don’t really understand why John Wayne fell in love with me or why he left me, do you?

“We can’t do this anymore,” John Wayne said to Etta Joseph.
It was the last day of shooting. Natalie Wood had already gone home; John Wayne had already saved her from the Indians.
“I’m going back to Hollywood,” he said.
Etta wept.
“I knew this day would come,” she said. “And I understand. You’re a family man.”
“Yes, my family needs me,” he said. “But more than that, my country needs me. They need me to be John Wayne.”
He kissed her then, one last kiss, and gave her his cowboy hat. She never wore it, not once, and gave it to her next lover, a rodeo Indian who lost it somewhere at a powwow in Arlee, Montana.

Q: I don’t want to insult an elder. I know, within the indigenous cultures, that we’re supposed to respect our elders…
A: Oh, no, no, you’ve got that all wrong. You’re not required to respect elders. After all, most people are idiots, regardless of age. In tribal cultures, we just make sure that elders remain an active part of the culture, even if they’re idiots. Especially if they’re idiots. You can’t just abandon your old people, even if they have nothing intelligent to say. Even if they’re crazy.
Q: Are you crazy?

On his deathbed in a Santa Monica hospital, over twenty years after he’d played Ethan Edwards in the Searchers, John Wayne picked up the telephone and dialed a number that had not changed since 1952.
“Hello,” Said Etta when she answered. “Hello, hello, hello.”
John Wayne listened to her voice. He didn’t know what to say. He hadn’t talked to her since that night in Monument Valley, when he’d climbed into the bed of a travelling pickup, and stood tall and proud—with the sun rising, of all things—and watched Etta get smaller and smaller on the horizon.
What was the last thing he’d said to her before he left her forever? He couldn’t remember now—the painkiller, chemotherapy, and exhaustion all played tricks with his memory—but he knew it was something he should not have said. And what was he supposed to say to her now, all these years later, as he lay dying? Should he apologize, confess, repent? He had lived a large and brilliant life with his wife and sons—he’d loved them and been loved with tenderness—but he had often thought of that tiny and lovely Spokane Indian woman who was all alone and lost in the Navajo desert. He knew he was going to die soon—and would, in fact, die later that night with his wife and sons at his bedside—but he wanted to leave the world without his earthly doubts and fears. But how could he tell Etta that? How could he tell her the story of his last twenty years, how could he listen to her story of the last twenty years, and how could either of them find enough time and forgiveness for each other?
John Wayne held the telephone close to his mouth and eyes and wept his way across all of the miles and years.
“Marion?” asked Etta. “Marion, is that you?”

Q: Is that everything?
A: It’s all I can remember. Quite an example of the oral tradition, enit?
Q: Lovely. But I wonder, how much of it is true and how much of it is lies?
A: Well, now, an Indian has to keep her secrets, or she’s just not Indian. But an Indian a lot smarter than me once said this: If it’s fiction, then it better be true.
Q: How oxymoronic.
A: Yeah, kind of like saying Native American. That’s an oxymoron for you.
Q: Well, I better get going. I got to find a flight to California.
A: Good for you. But don’t you want to talk about powwow dancing?
Q: Well, sure, what would you like to say?
A: I was the worst powwow dancer in the world. I’d start dancing at some powwow, and the Master of Ceremonies would shout out, “Hey, stop the powwow, stop the powwow, Etta is dancing, she’s ruining ten thousand years of tribal traditions. If we don’t stop the powwow now, she might start singing, and then we’re really going to be in trouble.”
Q: Well, I suppose that’s not going to help my thesis.
A: No, I suppose not. But my sons are really good powwow dancers. They still like to dance now and again.
Q: Your sons? My God, how old are they?
A: One hundred years old today. They’re twins. I have nine children, thirty-two grandchildren, one hundred and three great-great-grandchildren, and one great-great-great-grandchild. I’ve made my own damn tribe.
Q: I’d love to talk to your sons. Where are they, on the reservation?
A: Oh, no, they live up on the men’s floor here. I baked them a cake. My whole family is coming.
Q: Your sons, what are their names?
A: OH, look, here thy come now. They’re early. Boys, I’d like you to meet Dr. Spencer Cox, he’s a good friend of the Indians. Dr. Cox, I’d like you to meet my sons, Marion and John.

Sitting alone in his car outside of the retirement home, Spencer ejected the cassette tape from the recorder. He could destroy the tape or keep it; he could erase Etta’s voice or transcribe it. It didn’t matter what he chose to do with her story because the story would continue to exist with or without him. Was the story true or false? Was that the question Spencer needed to ask?
Inside, an old woman kneeled in a circle with her loved ones and led them in prayer.
Outside, a white man closed his eyes and prayed to the ghosts of John Wayne, Ethan Edwards, and Marion Morrison, that Holy Trinity.
Somebody said nothing and somebody said amen, amen, amen."

3631,"Ah, well can I the day recall, when first
The conflict fierce of love I felt, and said:
If this be love, how hard it is to bear!

With eyes still fixed intent upon the ground,
I saw but her, whose artless innocence,
Triumphant took possession of this heart.

Ah, Love, how badly hast thou governed me!
Why should affection so sincere and pure,
Bring with it such desire, such suffering?

Why not serene, and full, and free from guile
But sorrow-laden, and lamenting sore,
Should joy so great into my heart descend?

O tell me, tender heart, that sufferest so,
Why with that thought such anguish should be blent,
Compared with which, all other thoughts were naught?

That thought, that ever present in the day,
That in the night more vivid still appeared,
When all things round in sweet sleep seemed to rest:
Thou, restless, both with joy and misery
Didst with thy constant throbbings weary so
My breast, as panting in my bed I lay.

And when worn out with grief and weariness,
In sleep my eyes I closed, ah, no relief
It gave, so broken and so feverish!

How brightly from the depths of darkness, then,
The lovely image rose, and my closed eyes,
Beneath their lids, their gaze upon it fed!

O what delicious impulses, diffused,
My weary frame with sweet emotion filled!
What myriad thoughts, unstable and confused,

Were floating in my mind! As through the leaves
Of some old grove, the west wind, wandering,
A long, mysterious murmur leaves behind.

And as I, silent, to their influence yield,
What saidst thou, heart, when she departed, who
Had caused thee all thy throbs, and suffering?

No sooner had I felt within, the heat
Of love's first flame, than with it flew away
The gentle breeze, that fanned it into life.
Sleepless I lay, until the dawn of day;
The steeds, that were to leave me desolate,
Their hoofs were beating at my father's gate.

And I, in mute suspense, poor timid fool,
With eye that vainly would the darkness pierce,
And eager ear intent, lay, listening,

That voice to hear, if, for the last time, I
Might catch the accents from those lovely lips;
The voice alone; all else forever lost!

How many vulgar tones my doubtful ear
Would smite, with deep disgust inspiring me,
With doubt tormented, holding hard my breath!

And when, at last, that voice into my heart
Descended, passing sweet, and when the sound
Of horses and of wheels had died away;

In utter desolation, then, my head
I in my pillow buried, closed my eyes,
And pressed my hand against my heart, and sighed.

Then, listlessly, my trembling knees across
The silent chamber dragging, I exclaimed,
“Nothing on earth can interest me more!”
The bitter recollection cherishing
Within my breast, to every voice my heart,
To every face, insensible remained.

Long I remained in hopeless sorrow drowned;
As when the heavens far and wide their showers
Incessant pour upon the fields around.

Nor had I, Love, thy cruel power known,
A boy of eighteen summers flown, until
That day, when I thy bitter lesson learned;

When I each pleasure held in scorn, nor cared
The shining stars to see, or meadows green,
Or felt the charm of holy morning light;

The love of glory, too, no longer found
An echo in my irresponsive breast,
That, once, the love of beauty with it shared.

My favorite studies I neglected quite;
And those things vain appeared, compared with which,
I used to think all other pleasures vain.

Ah! how could I have changed so utterly?
How could one passion all the rest destroy?
Indeed, what helpless mortals are we all!

My heart my only comfort was, and with
That heart, in conference perpetual,
A constant watch upon my grief to keep.

My eye still sought the ground, or in itself
Absorbed, shrank from encountering the glance
Of lovely or unlovely countenance;

The stainless image fearing to disturb,
So faithfully reflected in my breast;
As winds disturb the mirror of the lake.

And that regret, that I could not enjoy
Such happiness, which weighs upon the mind,
And turns to poison pleasure that has passed,

Did still its thorn within my bosom lodge,
As I the past recalled; but shame, indeed,
Left not its cruel sting within this heart.

To heaven, to you, ye gentle souls, I swear,
No base desire intruded on my thought;
But with a pure and sacred flame I burned.

That flame still lives, and that affection pure;
Still in my thought that lovely image breathes,
From which, save heavenly, I no other joy,

Have ever known; my only comfort, now!"

9039,"She's to blame, I'll erase routine
With a spark to ignite the flame
And in this struggle of guilt to tame
It's freedom I'll obtain
She tied me up, removed my crown
Bittered all good taste
I'm sorry for everything I've done
I can't deny instinct

Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout an endless hell
It's dark like Poe

Forgiveness came, we embrace the key
Found water to douse the flame
We ended our difference of soul and brain
Forever we are changed
I've just set out on a brand new race
Can we keep the pace
I can't believe what we've become
I'll leave without a trace
Look what I have found
A seashell in a sea of shells
I'm good at planting my own seeds
To sprout endless hell
It's dark like Poe

Leave without a trace
I'll leave without a trace"
8400,"In mythology, the giants were birthed from the blood of Uranus’s castrated prick wherever it splattered across the womb of Gaia

The earth sometimes takes issue with the heavens – and can react in most uncontrollable ways

Still, the Olympians killed the overgrown with the help of the mortal, Heracles

In economics, continuous growth is a virtue, coupled right alongside a few humans’ endless creativity

Read it

Earthly wealth often forgets the heavenly birthright of the tired and the poor

Weep

Still, money talks and human capital jaywalks with the help of a demographic fighting its long-term survival

In biology, we call continuous growth a cancer

A body sometimes rebels against itself to save itself with no awareness that it’s ending itself

Still, the old gods watch the new giants’ invisible hands; the old gods quietly wait for a new Heracles to nock an ancient, accurate bow"

Well I beat a bad rap when I skip a soultrap
Just trippin’ and laughin’ at the crap
Dap is what I get the best skins that I hit
You know we rock the fuckin’ joint and we split
Singin’ and rhymin’s what I’m better for
When I describe I’m a scribe with a metaphor
I use a simile lightly ‘cause that shit's played
The common way most rhymes are made, ya know
I rock like this I flow like that
But all those comparisons are just that
Kickin’ different styles I’ll be right here
Today, tomorrow, next week and next year
I always say what I feel and that is a promise
Nothing in life is above being honest
Sauna is cool compared to being on stage
But that’s how it’s gotta go in the stone age
The fame in my game I name rapture
Like a polished rock I’ll make it shine for sure
Word is that I’ve travelled become unraveled
I been around the world baby gimme an apple
I’ll be your boogie man rather than Son-of-Sam
What I am is what I am
Though we don’t have too long to love a day a night
We only love those who love us right back

Rocks his hood and plays it mellow
While maple leaves change into yellow

Tryin’ to beat my high score since the age of ten
See my high score flash on the back glass

Oh no it’s not a joke, it’s how we feel
Put to test like a sugar ray scientist

Smooth like reggie miller in an airborne freeze frame
Funky like the kung-fu that can put you to shame

Standin’ up front with a tight stomach showin'

926,"In the United States, some 16 million jobs depend on the strength and continued success of American agriculture. Our farmers grow the safest and most abundant supply of food, fiber and energy in the world. Innovations in agriculture allow families to put healthy, nutritious food on their tables at a lower cost than in most other countries. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act reforms, eliminates and streamlines numerous programs, saving taxpayers $23 billion. It does this while strengthening the tools available to producers to help manage risks and conserve natural resources.

Title I: Commodities
Farmers face unique risks unlike those in other professions. Weather and market conditions outside a producer’s control can have a devastating effect on producers, especially family farms. This bill ends direct payments, strengthens crop insurance, and encourages innovative risk management approaches that only provide assistance to producers when their farms are threatened by risks outside their control.

Eliminates Direct Payments
Direct Payments, Counter-Cyclical Payments (CCPs), the Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) Program, and the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments (SURE) Program are repealed at the end of the 2012 crop year, creating $16 billion in savings for deficit reduction.

Ends Farm Payments to Millionaires
Any person or entity with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of more than $750,000 will be ineligible for payments from Title I Farm Bill programs, which are now capped at $50,000 per entity. This bill also ensures that payments go to those farmers with an active stake in the farming operation.

Responsible Risk Management
Farmers will have access to risk management tools that complement crop insurance and protect against both price and yield losses. The Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program allows farmers to choose between coverage at the individual farm level or at the county-level. Payments to farmers will be available only when actual losses are experienced off of a market-based historic benchmark. The Adverse Market Payments (AMP) program provides payments to farmers only when prices drop below a reference price. These payments are made on historic base acres, decoupled from production, thereby minimizing the program’s influence on farmers’ decisions on what and where to plant. In order to be eligible for ARC and AMP, all farmers must agree to comply with conservation and wetlands requirements.
￼
Marketing Loans
The Marketing Loan Program is continued to help provide farmers operating capital for their farms with a loan rate adjustment for upland cotton that is designed to bring the program into better compliance with World Trade Organization (WTO) requirements in response to Brazil’s WTO lawsuit. To receive marketing loans, farmers must agree to comply with conservation and wetlands requirements to the same degree as they do for eligibility in AMP and ARC.

Sugar
The Sugar Program is continued without changes through 2017.

Stronger Dairy Programs
Recognizing that dairy is a unique commodity, two new programs replace existing dairy programs. The Dairy Production Market Protection Program (DPMPP) is a voluntary program that protects producer margins equal to the difference between the all-milk price and a national feed cost. For small and medium-sized farms, additional margin protection is offered on the first 4 million pounds of milk marketed (the annual production of approximately 200 cows). The Dairy Market Stabilization Program (DMSP) promotes growth while encouraging producers who participate in DPMPP to scale down production when the market is oversupplied. These programs replace the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) and the Milk Income Loss Contract Program (MILC). The USDA is given more authority and resources for transparency measures to make sure reported dairy prices are accurate.
Livestock & Supplemental Disaster Program
The bill extends supplemental disaster assistance for producers whose livestock has been affected by high mortality rates caused by severe weather, disease, or other acts of nature. Additionally, it will provide assistance to livestock producers who have experienced grazing losses due to drought. It also continues assistance for natural disasters that destroy grazing land, honey bees, farm fish, orchard trees, and nursery trees.

Title II: Conservation
Our rapidly growing population demands that America’s farmers double their production over the next few decades and use fewer acres to do so. Conservation programs ensure we have a safe and abundant food supply, clean water, and thriving wildlife populations. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 consolidates 23 existing conservation programs into four fundamental program functions, achieving $5 billion in deficit reduction.

Working Lands

Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)
EQIP will continue to provide cost-share for certain activities on working lands that help farmers avoid and comply with regulation. Many parts of the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) have been consolidated into EQIP, focusing the program on farmers and ranchers looking to create or improve areas for wildlife habitat on their working lands.

Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP)
This program continues to encourage higher levels of conservation and the adoption of new and emerging conservation technologies on farms, ranches, and forests. Some changes are made to ease use and implementation of the program. Additionally, the cap on the number of nonindustrial private forestlands that can be enrolled in the program is removed and greater focus is given to identifying resource concerns at the local level. The program also gains flexibility to accept land coming out of the Conservation Reserve Program.

Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG)
Conservation Innovation Grants are provided on a competitive basis to encourage the development of new or improved conservation practices. CIG is geared towards projects that offer new approaches to providing producers environmental and production benefits. A new reporting requirement is added to increase program transparency.

Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program
Private landowners are able to realize a value-added benefit by creating wildlife habitats and opening their land up to hunting, fishing, and other kinds of public outdoor recreation. This program is continued and the Secretary is required to report to Congress on the program’s effectiveness in 2015.

Conservation Reserve Program

Refocuses the Conservation Reserve Program
The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) removes highly erodible land from production to benefit soil and water quality as well as wildlife habitats. The program currently has an acreage cap of 32 million acres. Over the next two years, the contracts on over 10 million acres will expire. The bill lowers the acreage cap through a multi-year step-down to 25 million acres, allowing for the re- enrollment and prioritization of the most highly erodible, sensitive acres. There is an added focus on grassland conservation. This program also continues the Transition Incentives Program, which allows retiring farmers and ranchers to transfer their land to a beginning farmer or rancher to begin production while still receiving CRP payments in the final two years of their contracts.

Regional Partnerships
Regional Conservation Partnership Program
Four existing programs are consolidated into one that will support projects that improve soil quality, water quality, or wildlife habitat in a specific area or region. Projects are selected through a competitive, merit-based process, and producers are encouraged to leverage partner resources to achieve common goals. Within the program is a Critical Conservation Area component that funds projects in areas with particularly significant water quality and quantity issues facing natural resource regulatory pressures.

Easements

Simplified Easements Program
All conservation easement programs will be streamlined under one program, the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, with two parts: Agricultural Land Easements and Wetlands Easements. Agricultural Land Easements protect lands from development and keep them devoted to agricultural use as well as keep land for grazing. Wetland Easements restore, protect, and enhance wetlands, which are important for water quality, quantity and wildlife habitat issues in many areas. The program focuses on long term land protection.

Other

Conservation of Private Grazing Land
The program is reauthorized to improve private grazing land by offering technical assistance and educational activities to landowners looking to better manage their land.

Grassroots Source Water Protection Program
State rural water associations are encouraged to use technical assistance in order to promote conservation activities that protect the quality of our nation’s drinking water through this program.

Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program
Many of the flood control structures (mainly dams) in our country are reaching their maximum life expectancy. This program provides for projects to improve their longevity.

Emergency Watershed Protection Program
Allows for termination or modification of floodplain easements where there is a public interest need with no alternative.

Title III: Trade
The United States maintains a significant trade surplus in agriculture, which is one of the few sectors where we export more than we import. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 continues that leadership with a focus on opening new markets and fighting trade barriers. It also recognizes the importance of America’s leadership in times of food emergencies and reforms key policies to reduce waste in the system and provide flexibility to respond to changing food aid needs.

Agricultural Trade Promotion
Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102)
This program provides export credit guarantees to help ensure the availability of credit to finance the exports of U.S. agricultural products to countries where financing might not be available. To address concerns related to the Brazil WTO case, current levels of export credit guarantees are reduced from $5.5 billion to $4.5 billion. This works to ensure compliance with the dispute settlement with Brazil, while maintaining United States export competitiveness for agriculture.

Market Access Program
This program provides matching funds to promote U.S. agricultural products in overseas markets.

Foreign Market Development Program
This program provides matching funds to nonprofit commodity or trade associations to aid in the long-term expansion of export markets for U.S. agricultural products.

Emerging Markets and Facility Guarantee Loan Program
This program provides funding for technical assistance to promote U.S. agricultural products to emerging markets and supports loan guarantees to establish or improve agriculture-related facilities in emerging markets.
￼
Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops
This program provides financial assistance to producers and exporters of specialty crops in addressing barriers to trade for their products in overseas markets. The bill revises the “Purpose” section of the program slightly to ensure that technical barriers to trade (e.g., burdensome regulatory requirements) can be addressed under the program.

Global Crop Diversity Trust
The Trust provides for storage and maintenance of seed from food crops from all over the world in a facility in the Arctic Circle in northern Norway. The bill authorizes funds through 2017 to fund the Global Crop Diversity Trust. U.S. contributions may not exceed one fourth of the total of funds contributed to the Trust from all sources.

International Food Aid Programs

Speeds Emergency Food Aid Response
The bill increases the amount of Title II funds available to support strategic prepositioning, which brings food aid commodities to at-risk regions before food emergencies strike.

Food for Peace
This is the largest food aid program under the Committee’s jurisdiction. It is comprised of four titles. However, Title II, which provides for emergency aid and non-emergency development projects, contains the title’s primary food aid budget authority. Taken as a whole, the program enables the U.S. to donate food overseas to promote food security.

Farmer to Farmer
This program, which is within Title II, sends American citizens with valuable agricultural skills to areas in developing countries that need technical assistance. This bill slightly raises the percentage of title funds to be used towards this program.

McGovern-Dole
This program facilitates distribution of food commodities through schools in developing countries through partner organizations to improve food security, reduce hunger, and improve literacy. The program has projects in over 40 countries and feeds about 5 million children in need every year.

Local and Regional Food Aid Procurement
Expanding on the success of a pilot program from the 2008 Farm Bill, Local and Regional Food Aid Procurement allows organizations to purchase food through local and regional markets. This promotes stability by supporting local producers and economies. By linking local and regional purchasing with the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the application process, this bill also encourages project graduation for schools participating in McGovern-Dole.

Food Aid Quality
The bill puts into action the recommendations of a study authorized by the 2008 Farm Bill to research U.S. Food Aid quality. The Administrator is given increased flexibility to improve the nutritional profile of food aid for target populations, such as children under five and mothers.

Resiliency Pilot in the Horn of Africa
Since the last Farm Bill, the famine in the Horn of Africa has brought new organizations and governments to the region, all intent on helping reduce hunger and improve food security. This new pilot will help coordinate these efforts on the ground by looking at interactions amongst the many groups doing resiliency work – the work that will help ensure that famine does not occur again.

Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust
The Trust holds extra resources so that the U.S. can respond quickly to food crises when domestic supplies are short.

Title IV: Nutrition
The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 strengthens the integrity and accountability of federal nutrition programs. The legislation ensures that every dollar be spent responsibly so that those who need help can get it. The bill cracks down on fraud and abuse, while strengthening efforts to get food assistance to those most in need.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

Cracks Down on Trafficking
The Department of Agriculture will receive additional funds to prevent trafficking of food assistance benefits and to strengthen retailer program integrity.

Prevents Lottery Winners from Receiving Food Assistance
Anyone with substantial lottery or gambling winnings will lose benefits immediately after receiving winnings. Winners will be prevented from receiving new benefits if they do not meet the financial requirements of SNAP.

Prevents College Students from Misusing Benefits
Limits SNAP eligibility for college students based on Perkins program criteria. This focuses eligibility on those participating in technical and vocational education programs, primarily 2 year colleges, trade studies, remedial course work, basic adult literacy, or English as a second language.

Improves the Quality of Participating Retail Stores
Requires participating retailers to stock more staple foods like fruits and vegetables and gives USDA the ability to exclude stores like liquor stores that do not fulfill the mission of the program, while preserving food access for participants.

Closes Gap in Standards for Utility Allowance
Benefits allocations are determined using both income and expenses. The Standard Utility Allowance is used by many states to estimate average utility costs in order to make benefits determinations. This provision will stop states from issuing extremely low LIHEAP benefits to qualify households to receive Standard Utility Allowances for the sole purpose of increasing their SNAP benefits. This provision will not affect any households that can demonstrate a utility cost.

Preserves SNAP Nutrition Education
This program supports projects that improve the likelihood that individuals eligible to receive SNAP will choose physically active lifestyles and make healthy food choices within a limited budget, consistent with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The bill adds physical activity as an eligible use of the program, and maintains current funding levels.

Continues Employment and Training Program
Continues Employment and Training to provide for employment through work-related education and training activities.

Additional Nutrition Programs

Gives Seniors Access to Healthy Fruits and Vegetables
The bill maintains funding authorizations at current levels for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). Transitions CSFP to a program for senior citizen populations while allowing the small percentage of women and children currently enrolled in CSFP to continue to receive services through the program until they have exceeded the age of eligibility. Women, infants and children will all be served by the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, which is more suited to meet their needs.

Increases Assistance for Food Banks
Local food banks are struggling to provide enough food to needy families in their area. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) helps supplement the diets of low-income individuals by providing emergency food and nutrition assistance, largely through food banks.

Department of Defense Fresh Program
The bill maintains current funding for the Department of Defense Fresh Program, which distributes fresh fruits and vegetables to schools and service institutions. It also continues to allow the Agriculture Marketing Service to conduct pilots to allow states to source locally.

Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program
Maintains current funding levels for the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provides low-income seniors with coupons that can be exchanged for eligible foods (fruits, vegetables, honey, and fresh-cut herbs) at farmers' markets, roadside stands, and community supported agriculture programs.

Pulse Products Pilot
The bill establishes a pulse products program that encourages sampling of a variety of pulse product foods for use in school meal programs. Requires an evaluation to determine whether pulse consumption increased and which products were most acceptable to schoolchildren.

Healthy Food Financing Initiative
In both urban and rural low-income communities, many people lack reasonable access to nutritious and affordable food. The bill authorizes the Healthy Food Financing Initiative to administer loans and grants to improve access to healthy foods in these “food deserts,” improving the health of families and creating and preserving jobs.

Technology Modernization
The bill directs the Food and Nutrition Services to conduct demonstration projects to test new technologies like smart phones and online payments for retailers to improve access through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Promotes Better Health for School Children
The bill maintains current funding levels for the Fresh Fruit and Vegetables Program, which provides free fresh fruits and vegetables to elementary school children throughout the school day in school districts with a high proportion of low-income students.

Community Food Projects
The bill provides for grants to eligible nonprofit organizations to improve community access to food through the development of innovative projects such as school garden programs and urban greenhouse initiatives.

Encourages Healthy Food Choices
The bill provides grants to incentivize the purchase of fruits and vegetables by SNAP participants. Eligible entities conducting programs like “Double Up Food Bucks” will be able to access federal matching funds to expand efforts into additional communities.

Promotes Food and Agriculture Through Service and Learning
The bill establishes a service program in which members work in K-12 schools to engage children in experiential learning about agriculture, gardening, nutrition, cooking and where food comes from, as well as to facilitate a connection between schools and area agricultural producers.

Increases Coordination at USDA to Improve Healthy Purchases</>
The bill establishes an interagency taskforce for the purpose of providing coordination and direction for commodity programs that supply food to key nutrition programs like the Emergency Food Assistance Program and National School Lunch Program.

Title V: Credit
The average American farmer is over 60 years old, and a shortage of beginning farmers is threatening the long-term economic success of American agriculture. The recommendations continue the work of the 2008 Farm Bill to assist beginning farmers and family farms.

Helps Farmers Get Started with Conservation
￼￼The Conservation Loan and Loan Guarantee Program provides loans to borrowers to build conservation structures or establish conservation practices.

Support for Beginning Farmers
The Beginning Farmer and Rancher Individual Development Accounts Pilot Program authorizes matching-funds for savings accounts specifically to be used for farming-related expenses for beginning farmers and ranchers.

Loan Fund Set-Asides
The credit title maintains higher loan funds reserved for direct farm ownership loans and also maintains the strengthened down payment loan program. It continues to reserve a portion of the guaranteed farm ownership loan funds and direct operating loan funds for beginning farmers and ranchers.

Maintains Loan Authorization Levels
￼The credit title recognizes the importance and success of Department of Agriculture loan programs. All Farm Service Agency (FSA) loan authorization levels are reauthorized until 2018.

State-Mediation Program
This program recognizes the importance of state mediation programs in resolving agriculture and USDA-related disputes. This program has been incorporated in the Farm Bill by extending the 2010 reauthorization of the USDA’s State Agricultural Mediation Program until 2018.

Title VI: Rural Development
Rural communities reflect the indomitable spirit of America and have always been a symbol of our national values. Today, rural communities face serious economic threats and an erosion of a way of life that stretches back many generations. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 helps rebuild those communities and invest in the future, especially broadband and business development, to help rural communities thrive in the 21st century economy.

Rural Business Development Programs

Continues Support for Rural Business Development
The Rural Business Development Grants program will award competitive grants to public agencies and non-profit community development organizations for business development, planning, technical assistance, or job training in rural areas.

Supports Rural Cooperative Development
The Rural Cooperative Development Grants program provides competitive grants to non-profit organizations that work to establish rural business cooperatives.

Encourages Rural Entrepreneurship
The Rural Microenterprise Assistance Program awards grants to microenterprise development organizations to provide training, business planning assistance, market development assistance, and other services to rural businesses. This program also awards funding for the establishment of microloan programs designed to support entrepreneurs in rural areas.

￼Supports Rural Food Processing
The Value-Added Agricultural Market Development Program Grants program is designed to encourage independent producers of agricultural commodities to process their raw products into marketable goods, thereby increasing farm income. Grants may be used for planning activities, for working capital for marketing value-added agricultural products, and for farm-based renewable energy. The program sets aside a portion of funding for projects benefiting beginning farmers and ranchers.

￼Continues Business Loan Support￼
The Business and Industry Direct and Guaranteed Loan Program supports business, industry, and employment in rural communities by bolstering the existing private credit structure. The bill reserves funds made available through the program for projects that include the processing, distribution, storage, and marketing of locally produced agricultural food products.

Infrastructure Improvement Programs

￼Access to Broadband Services in Rural Areas￼
Through USDA’s Broadband Program, the Department provides funds for the construction, improvement, and acquisition of facilities and equipment needed to provide broadband service in rural communities. The bill authorizes USDA to begin providing combinations of grants and loans for the expansion of broadband service. The program will target funds to rural communities isolated from significant population centers.

￼Distance Learning and Telemedicine￼
This program provides competitive grant and loan funding that supports equipment and infrastructure improvements that enhance telecommunications capabilities at educational and medical facilities.

￼Water, Waste Disposal and Wastewater Facility Grants and Loans￼

Rural communities with populations of less than 5,500 are prioritized for funding.

￼Rural Water and Wastewater Circuit Rider Program￼
This program provides competitive grants to non-profit organizations that give technical assistance to rural public water systems. This technical assistance helps the water systems to comply with state and federal environmental regulations. The program is authorized to receive $25 million annually.

￼Rural Energy Savings Program￼
The bill authorizes a new loan program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, which will issue zero-interest loans to any electric cooperative or coordinated group of electric cooperatives for the purpose of lending the funds to their customers to make energy saving retrofit and structural improvements.

Community Development Programs

￼Strategic Economic and Community Development￼
The bill authorizes the Secretary to give priority to applications submitted for funds through Rural Development programs that support regional approaches to community and economic development. These applications should reflect the participation of multiple stakeholders in the service area of the proposal. The applications should also have clear objectives and an explanation of performance measures that will be used to determine progress in meeting those objectives.

￼Technical Assistance for Community Facilities Projects￼
The bill authorizes the Secretary to make up to 3 percent of funds provided through the Community Facilities Loan and Grant Program available to applicants for technical assistance. Many rural communities do not have full-time staff to assist in the preparation of funding applications. This provision will help smaller communities in the development of their applications to the Community Facilities program, which supports projects related to economic development, public safety, and health care delivery.

￼Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas￼
This program awards competitive grant funding to national non-profit organizations that provide agricultural producers information pertaining to the reduction of input costs, conservation of energy resources, and expansion of markets through the use of sustainable farming practices.

￼Title VII: Research￼
Decades of research have allowed American producers to consistently outperform producers in other countries by being more efficient, more innovative, and more productive with limited resources. The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 continues that leadership by continuing critical research initiatives and creates a new nonprofit research foundation to bring public and private dollars together to support cutting-edge research.

￼Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research￼
The bill creates a new non-profit foundation, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, to leverage private funding, matched with federal dollars, to support agricultural research. This innovative approach will foster continued innovation in agricultural research.

￼Continues Critical Agricultural Research￼
The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) program provides competitive grants for basic and applied research. The bill does not include policy changes to the program.

￼University Research￼
The bill reauthorizes agricultural research activities at 1862, 1890 and 1994 land-grant institutions.

￼Extension Service￼
The bill reauthorizes funds for extension service activities.
￼
￼National Agricultural Research, Extension, Education and Economics (NAREEE) Advisory Board￼
The bill reauthorizes the NAREEE advisory board, which provides consultation to USDA, industry and Congress on agricultural research priorities. The NAREEE advisory board is directed to consult with industry groups on agricultural research, extension, education, and economics, and to make recommendations to the Secretary based on that consultation.

￼Policy Research Centers￼
This program provides competitive grants for cooperative agreements with policy research centers to conduct research and education programs concerning the effect of policies on the farm and agricultural sectors; the environment; drought mitigation; rural families and economies; and consumers, food and nutrition.

￼Capacity Building Grants for Non-Land Grant Colleges of Agriculture (NLGCA) Institutions￼
This program provides competitive grants to assist NLGCA institutions in maintaining and expanding the capacity to conduct education, research, and outreach activities related to agriculture, renewable resources, and other similar disciplines.

￼Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program￼
The bill continues the Beginning Farmer program, which develops and offers education, training, outreach and mentoring programs to ensure the success of the next generation of farmers. The bill expands eligibility to include military veterans who wish to begin a career in agriculture. The bill provides $85 million in mandatory funding for this program.

￼Addresses Critical Shortages of Veterinarians￼
The bill would help address the shortage of veterinarians in rural agricultural areas by supporting veterinary education and rural recruitment.

￼Increased Transparency for Budget Submissions￼
In order to increase transparency and reduce duplication across agencies, the bill requires the Department of Agriculture to provide more detailed information regarding expected research expenditures when submitting its annual budget request to Congress.

￼Title VIII: Forestry￼
The health of America’s forests is critical to the future of our economy, our environment, and our way of life. Forests provide clean drinking water, critical wildlife habitats, and recreational opportunities for our families. While the conservation title gives many tools to foresters to manage their land, additional efforts to preserve and improve our nation’s forests are included here.

￼Improves the Health of America’s Forests￼
The bill reauthorizes the Healthy Forest Reserve Program (HFRP), a voluntary program that enhances forest ecosystems to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered species, improve biodiversity, and enhance carbon sequestration.
￼
￼Supports Private Lands Forestry￼
The bill supports programs, like the Forest Legacy Program and Forest Stewardship Program, which ensure that private non-industrial forest owners have the tools and support they need to properly manage their land.

￼International Forestry￼
The trade of illegal forests products is threatening our domestic markets, where honest dealers are trying to sell their wood products. This program encourages the trade of legally harvested timber. It also supports domestic production by working to prevent invasive species from entering the country.

￼Addresses Insect and Disease Infestations￼
Parts of our nation’s forests are experiencing epidemic levels of insect infestations. The bill focuses on areas and watersheds where help is needed most to improve or protect forest health.

￼Stewardship Contracting￼
This is an effective tool for land management that allows the Forest Service to conduct important restoration work to improve the health of our nation’s forests.

￼Title IX: Energy￼
With new opportunities in bio-based manufacturing, advanced biofuels, and renewable energy, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 continues programs that are helping to create jobs while simultaneously reducing our nation’s dependence on foreign oil.

￼Rural Energy for America Program￼
The popular Rural Energy for America (REAP) program has helped nearly 4,000 farmers, ranchers and rural business owners lower their energy bills by installing renewable and energy efficient systems. The bill will provide a streamlined application process for farmers and rural businesses applying for small and medium sized projects. The bill authorizes $241 million in mandatory funding for REAP.

￼Promotes Advanced Bioenergy Production￼
The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides support for farmers and ranchers who wish to plant energy crops to produce and use biomass crops for conversion to advanced biofuels or bioenergy. Agricultural producers in BCAP project areas may contract with the Department of Agriculture to receive biomass crop establishment payments up to 50 percent of costs, plus annual payments in amounts determined by the Secretary in subsequent years to help to compensate for lost opportunity costs until crops are established. The program will receive $193 million in mandatory funding.

￼Supports the Growing Bio-Based Economy￼
The bill will reauthorize and modify USDA’s BioPreferred Program and the Federal Government Procurement Preference Program. Many of the modifications are adopted from the “Make it Here, Grow it Here” initiative which includes reporting of biobased purchases by the federal agencies, auditing and enforcement of the biobased and education/outreach activities. The program will receive $15 million in mandatory funding.

￼Biorefinery Assistance Program￼
This program provides loan guarantees for renewable energy projects. Eligibility for the program has been expanded to include biobased manufacturing and renewable chemicals, which uses agricultural products to make value-added products. The program will receive $216 million in mandatory funding under the bill.

￼Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels￼
This program provides production payments for advanced bioenergy sources such as methane digesters, advanced biofuels and biopower.

￼Biomass Research and Development Initiative (BRDI)￼
The bill will reauthorize funding for research on biomass feedstock development for bioenergy and biobased products. The bill provides $130 million in mandatory funding for BRDI.

￼Community Wood Energy Program￼
This program provides competitive, cost-share grants for communities to supply public buildings with energy from sustainably-harvested wood from the local area.

￼Title X: Specialty Crops & Horticulture￼
The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 recognizes the diversity of American agriculture and the importance of specialty crops and organics, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, horticulture, and nursery crops. Sales of specialty crops total nearly $65 billion per year, making them a critical part of the U.S. economy and an important job creator.

￼Supports Farmers Markets and Local Foods￼
The Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program continues successful efforts from the Farmers Market Promotion Program by providing competitive grants to improve and expand farmers markets, roadside stands, community-supported agriculture programs, and other direct producer-to-consumer market opportunities. The program authority is expanded to also provide assistance in developing local food system infrastructure and central regional food development centers like food hubs and terminal markets that help producers with training, aggregating, distributing and other market activities.

￼Local Food Data and Evaluation￼
The bill expands collection of data related to local and regional food systems and directs the Department of Agriculture to evaluate the success of and recommend improvements to current programs designed to strengthen access to local foods.

￼Continues Specialty Crop Research￼
Provides mandatory funding over 10 years for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, ensuring funding will be available for key research projects for fruits, vegetables and other specialty crops. This funding also ensures funding will be available for this program in the next farm bill.

￼Specialty Crop Block Grants￼
The bill adjusts the grant allocation formula from solely the value of specialty crop production in a state to the average of both the value of specialty crop production and acres of specialty crops planted in a state. This change ensures that states receive credit for both high value crops as well as the number of acres devoted to specialty crop production in a state. The bill also allows funding for multistate projects related to pest and disease, food safety, and commodity-specific projects.

￼Continues Data Collection on Organics￼
The bill improves coordination between the Agriculture Marketing Service and the Risk Management Agency to ensure risk management tools are sufficient.

￼National Organic Program￼
The National Organic Program is reauthorized. One time mandatory funding is provided for technology upgrades to improve program performance. Additionally, the bill gives NOP increased enforcement over the organic seal.

￼Organic Research Initiative￼
Funding for the Organic Research and Extension Initiative is provided at $80 million over 5 years.

￼Fights Pests and Diseases￼
The bill consolidates the National Clean Plant Network and the Pest and Disease Management and Disaster Prevention Program. These programs focus on early detection and surveillance of invasive pests, interventions to prevent crop damage and supplies clean pathogen free plant material for producers.

￼Title XI: Crop Insurance￼
Responding to the concerns of farmers across America, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 strengthens and improves coverage for all commodities and underserved crops like fruit and vegetables without making budget cuts to the crop insurance title. The bill also addresses the declining Actual Production History (APH) yield problem by increasing the county transitional yield.

￼Creates the Supplemental Coverage Option￼
The Supplemental Coverage Option allows producers to purchase additional coverage on an area basis. The coverage option establishes a trigger on coverage offered only if losses exceed 22 percent for producers enrolled in ARC and 10 percent for all other producers.

￼Expands Crop Insurance for Fruit and Vegetable Producers￼
Crop insurance coverage is expanded for underserved crops and regions, including fruit and vegetable producers. The bill provides additional assistance for underserved producers to partner with private developers of crop insurance to create improved insurance products. The bill also allows the Risk Management Agency (RMA) to conduct research and development on new or improved crop insurance products. It also creates a new partnership to expand access of index- based weather insurance products for fruit and vegetable growers who don’t have sufficient price or yield data for traditional insurance.

￼Provides Revenue Crop Insurance for Cotton and Peanut Producers￼< /b>
The bill creates a stand-alone revenue protection coverage program for cotton growers. It also creates a separate peanut revenue insurance with an effective price for peanut growers.

￼Improves Crop Insurance for Beginning Farmers and Ranchers￼
Beginning farmers and ranchers are given a 10 percentage point discount for all crop insurance premiums. The bill also provides beginning farmers and ranchers with an improved production history when they have previous farming experience or when they face natural disasters.

￼Title XII: Miscellaneous￼
The Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013 covers a broad range of areas. A number of programs, including those that assist socially disadvantaged farmers, those that assist livestock producers, and those that focus on workforce development, do not fit into other titles and are included here.

￼Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers￼
The bill continues grants to organizations that work with minority farmers to help them acquire, own, operate, and retain farms and ranches and equally participate in all USDA programs. We provided $50 million in mandatory funding for this program.

￼Continues Advocacy and Outreach Efforts￼
The bill reauthorizes the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, which was created by the 2008 Farm Bill to increase the viability and profitability of small farms and ranches, beginning farmers or ranchers, and socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers.

￼Grants to Improve Agricultural Labor Supply, Stability, Safety, and Training￼
The bill reauthorizes the Agricultural Career and Employment Grants Program. Funds may be used to assist agricultural employers and farmworkers to develop skills, the provision of agricultural labor market information, transportation and short-term housing.

￼Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison￼
The bill creates a military veterans agricultural liaison to help military veterans navigate and utilize USDA programs to become involved in agriculture.

￼Office of Tribal Relations￼
The bill directs USDA to create an Office of Tribal Relations.

￼Wildlife Reservoir Zoonotic Disease Initiative￼
To ensure continued research to combat devastating livestock diseases, the Wildlife Reservoir Zoonotic Disease Initiative is created to improve diagnostic testing and vaccines for bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, and other zoonotic diseases.

￼Ensures Health of American Livestock￼
The bill authorizes the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN). In addition, it reauthorizes the Trichinae Certification Program and the National Aquatic Health Plan.

￼Sheep Production and Marketing Grant Program￼
The bill establishes a competitive grant program to enhance production and marketing of the sheep industry.

￼Pilot Program to Eradicate Feral Swine￼

6855,"THE OWNERS OF THE land came onto the land, or more often a spokesman for the owners came. They came in closed cars, and they felt the dry earth with their fingers, and sometimes they drove big earth augers into the ground for soil tests. The tenants, from their sun-beaten dooryards, watched uneasily when the closed cars drove along the fields. And at last the owner men drove into the dooryards and sat in their cars to talk out of the windows. The tenant men stood beside the cars for a while, and then squatted on their hams and found sticks with which to mark the dust.

In the open doors the women stood looking out, and behind them the children—corn-headed children, with wide eyes, one bare foot on top of the other bare foot, and the toes working. The women and the children watched their men talking to the owner men. They were silent.

Some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do, and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel, and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold. And all of them were caught in something larger than themselves. Some of them hated the mathematics that drove them, and some were afraid, and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling. If a bank or a finance company owned the land, the owner man said, The Bank—or the Company—needs—wants—insists—must have—as though the Bank or the Company were a monster, with thought and feeling, which had ensnared them. These last would take no responsibility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves, while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time. Some of the owner men were a little proud to be slaves to such cold and powerful masters. The owner men sat in the cars and explained. You know the land is poor. You’ve scrabbled at it long enough, God knows.

The squatting tenant men nodded and wondered and drew figures in the dust, and yes, they knew, God knows. If the dust only wouldn’t fly. If the top would only stay on the soil, it might not be so bad.

The owner men went on leading to their point: You know the land’s getting poorer. You know what cotton does to the land; robs it, sucks all the blood out of it.

The squatters nodded—they knew, God knew. If they could only rotate the crops they might pump blood back into the land.

Well, it’s too late. And the owner men explained the workings and the thinkings of the monster that was stronger than they were. A man can hold land if he can just eat and pay taxes; he can do that.

Yes, he can do that until his crops fail one day and he has to borrow money from the bank. But—you see, a bank or a company can’t do that, because those creatures don’t breathe air, don’t eat side-meat. They breathe profits; they eat the interest on money. If they don’t get it, they die the way you die without air, without side-meat. It is a sad thing, but it is so. It is just so.

The squatting men raised their eyes to understand. Can’t we just hang on? Maybe the next year will be a good year. God knows how much cotton next year. And with all the wars—God knows what price cotton will bring. Don’t they make explosives out of cotton? And uniforms? Get enough wars and cotton’ll hit the ceiling. Next year, maybe. They looked up questioningly.

We can’t depend on it. The bank—the monster has to have profits all the time. It can’t wait. It’ll die. No, taxes go on. When the monster stops growing, it dies. It can’t stay one size.

Soft fingers began to tap the sill of the car window, and hard fingers tightened on the restless drawing sticks. In the doorways of the sun-beaten tenant houses, women sighed and then shifted feet so that the one that had been down was now on top, and the toes working. Dogs came sniffing near the owner cars and wetted on all four tires one after another. And chickens lay in the sunny dust and fluffed their feathers to get the cleansing dust down to the skin. In the little sties the pigs grunted inquiringly over the muddy remnants of the slops.
The squatting men looked down again. What do you want us to do? We can’t take less share of the crop—we’re half starved now. The kids are hungry all the time. We got no clothes, torn an’ ragged. If all the neighbors weren’t the same, we’d be ashamed to go to meeting.

And at last the owner men came to the point. The tenant system won’t work any more. One man on a tractor can take the place of twelve or fourteen families. Pay him a wage and take all the crop. We have to do it. We don’t like to do it. But the monster’s sick. Something’s happened to the monster.

But you’ll kill the land with cotton.

We know. We’ve got to take cotton quick before the land dies. Then we’ll sell the land. Lots of families in the East would like to own a piece of land.

The tenant men looked up alarmed. But what’ll happen to us? How’ll we eat?

You’ll have to get off the land. The plows’ll go through the dooryard.

And now the squatting men stood up angrily. Grampa took up the land, and he had to kill the Indians and drive them away. And Pa was born here, and he killed weeds and snakes. Then a bad year came and he had to borrow a little money. An’ we was born here. There in the door our children born here. And Pa had to borrow money. The bank

owned the land then, but we stayed and we got a little bit of what we raised.

We know that—all that. It’s not us, it’s the bank

. A bank isn’t like a man. Or an owner with fifty thousand acres, he isn’t like a man either. That’s the monster.

Sure, cried the tenant men, but it’s our land. We measured it and broke it up. We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if it’s no good, it’s still ours. That’s what makes it ours—being born on it, working it, dying on it. That makes ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.

We’re sorry. It’s not us. It’s the monster. The bank

isn’t like a man.
Yes, but the bank

is only made of men.

No, you’re wrong there—quite wrong there. The bank

is something else than men. It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It’s the monster. Men made it, but they can’t control it.

The tenants cried, Grampa killed Indians, Pa killed snakes for the land. Maybe we can kill banks—they’re worse than Indians and snakes. Maybe we got to fight to keep our land, like Pa and Grampa did.

And now the owner men grew angry. You’ll have to go. But it’s ours, the tenant men cried. WeNo. The bank

, the monster owns it. You’ll have to go. We’ll get our guns, like Grampa when the Indians came. What then? Well—first the sheriff, and then the troops. You’ll be stealing if you try to stay, you’ll be murderers if you kill to stay. The monster isn’t men, but it can make men do what it wants. But if we go, where’ll we go? How’ll we go? We got no money. We’re sorry, said the owner men. The bank, the fifty-thousand-acre owner can’t be responsible. You’re on land that isn’t yours. Once over the line maybe you can pick cotton in the fall. Maybe you can go on relief. Why don’t you go on west to California? There’s work there, and it never gets cold. Why, you can reach out anywhere and pick an orange. Why, there’s always some kind of crop to work in. Why don’t you go there? And the owner men started their cars and rolled away.

The tenant men squatted down on their hams again to mark the dust with a stick, to figure, to wonder. Their sunburned faces were dark, and their sun-whipped eyes were light. The women moved cautiously out of the doorways toward their men, and the children crept behind the women, cautiously, ready to run. The bigger boys squatted beside their fathers, because that made them men. After a time the women asked, What did he want?

And the men looked up for a second, and the smolder of pain was in their eyes. We got to get off. A tractor and a superintendent. Like factories.

Where’ll we go? the women asked.

We don’t know. We don’t know.

And the women went quickly, quietly back into the houses and herded the children ahead of them. They knew that a man so hurt and so perplexed may turn in anger, even on people he loves. They left the men alone to figure and to wonder in the dust.

After a time perhaps the tenant man looked about—at the pump put in ten years ago, with a goose-neck handle and iron flowers
on the spout, at the chopping block where a thousand chickens had been killed, at the hand plow lying in the shed, and the patent crib hanging in the rafters over it.

The children crowded about the women in the houses. What we going to do, Ma? Where we going to go?

The women said, We don’t know, yet. Go out and play. But don’t go near your father. He might whale you if you go near him. And the women went on with the work, but all the time they watched the men squatting in the dust—perplexed and figuring.

THE TRACTORS came over the roads and into the fields, great crawlers moving like insects, having the incredible strength of insects. They crawled over the ground, laying the track and rolling on it and picking it up. Diesel tractors, puttering while they stood idle; they thundered when they moved, and then settled down to a droning roar. Snubnosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through fences, through dooryards, in and out of gullies in straight lines. They did not run on the ground, but on their own roadbeds. They ignored hills and gulches, water courses

, fences, houses.

The man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man; gloved, goggled, rubber dust mask over nose and mouth, he was a part of the monster, a robot in the seat. The thunder of the cylinders sounded through the country, became one with the air and the earth, so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration. The driver could not control it—straight across country it went, cutting through a dozen farms and straight back. A twitch at the controls could swerve the cat’, but the driver’s hands could not twitch because the monster that built the tractors, the monster that sent the tractor out, had somehow got into the driver’s hands, into his brain and muscle, had goggled him and muzzled him—goggled his mind, muzzled his speech, goggled his perception, muzzled his protest. He could not see the land as it was, he could not smell the land as it smelled; his feet did not stamp the clods or feel the warmth and power

of the earth. He sat in an iron seat and stepped on iron pedals. He could not cheer or beat or curse or encourage the extension of his power, and because of this he could not cheer or whip or curse or encourage himself. He did not know or own or trust or beseech the land. If a seed dropped did not germinate, it was nothing. If the young thrusting plant withered in drought or drowned in a flood of rain, it was no more to the driver than to the tractor.

He loved the land no more than the bank

loved the land. He could admire the tractor—its machined surfaces, its surge of power, the roar of its detonating cylinders; but it was not his tractor. Behind the tractor rolled the shining disks, cutting the earth with blades not plowing but surgery, pushing the cut earth to the right where the second row of disks cut it and pushed it to the left; slicing blades shining, polished by the cut earth. And pulled behind the disks, the harrows combing with iron teeth so that the little clods broke up and the earth lay smooth. Behind the harrows, the long seeders—twelve curved iron penes erected in the foundry, orgasms set by gears, raping methodically, raping without passion. The driver sat in his iron seat and he was proud of the straight lines he did not will, proud of the tractor he did not own or love, proud of the power he could not control. And when that crop grew, and was harvested, no man had crumbled a hot clod in his fingers and let the earth sift past his fingertips. No man had touched the seed, or lusted for the growth. Men ate what they had not raised, had no connection with the bread. The land bore under iron, and under iron gradually died; for it was not loved or hated, it had no prayers or curses.

At noon the tractor driver stopped sometimes near a tenant house and opened his lunch: sandwiches wrapped in waxed paper, white bread, pickle, cheese, Spam, a piece of pie branded like an engine part. He ate without relish. And tenants not yet moved away came out to see him, looked curiously while the goggles were taken off, and the rubber dust mask, leaving white circles around the eyes and a large white circle around nose and mouth. The exhaust of the tractor puttered on, for fuel is so cheap it is more efficient to leave the engine running than to heat the Diesel nose for a new start

. Curious children crowded close, ragged children who ate their fried dough as they watched. They watched hungrily the unwrapping of the sandwiches, and their hunger-sharpened noses smelled the pickle, cheese, and Spam. They didn’t speak to the driver. They watched his hand as it carried food to his mouth. They did not watch him chewing; their eyes followed the hand that held the sandwich. After a while the tenant who could not leave the place came out and squatted in the shade beside the tractor.

“Why, you’re Joe Davis’s boy!”

“Sure,” the driver said.

“Well, what you doing this kind of work for—against your own people?”

“Three dollars a day. I got damn sick of creeping for my dinner—and not getting it. I got a wife and kids. We got to eat. Three dollars a day, and it comes every day.”

“That’s right,” the tenant said. “But for your three dollars a day fifteen or twenty families can’t eat at all. Nearly a hundred people have to go out and wander on the roads for your three dollars a day. Is that right?”

And the driver said, “Can’t think of that. Got to think of my own kids. Three dollars a day, and it comes every day. Times are changing, mister, don’t you know? Can’t make a living on the land unless you’ve got two, five, ten thousand acres and a tractor. Crop land isn’t for little guys like us any more. You don’t kick up a howl because you can’t make Fords, or because you’re not the telephone company. Well, crops are like that now. Nothing to do about it. You try to get three dollars a day someplace. That’s the only way.”

The tenant pondered. “Funny thing how it is. If a man owns a little property, that property is him, it’s part of him, and it’s like him. If he owns property only so he can walk on it and handle it and be sad when it isn’t doing well, and feel fine when the rain falls on it, that property is him, and some way he’s bigger because he owns it. Even if he isn’t successful he’s big with his property. That is so.”

And the tenant pondered more. “But let a man get property he doesn’t see, or can’t take time to get his fingers in, or can’t be there to walk on it—why, then the property is the man. He can’t do what he wants, he can’t think what he wants. The property is the man, stronger than he is. And he is small, not big. Only his possessions are big and he’s the servant of his property. That is so, too.”

The driver munched the branded pie and threw the crust away. “Times are changed, don’t you know? Thinking about stuff like that don’t feed the kids. Get your three dollars a day, feed your kids. You got no call to worry about anybody’s kids but your own. You get a reputation for talking like that, and you’ll never get three dollars a day. Big shots won’t give you three dollars a day if you worry about anything but your three dollars a day.”

“Nearly a hundred people on the road for your three dollars. Where will we go?”

“And that reminds me,” the driver said, “you better get out soon.

I’m going through the dooryard after dinner.”

“You filled in the well this morning.”

“I know. Had to keep the line straight. But I’m going through the dooryard after dinner. Got to keep the lines straight. And—well, you know Joe Davis, my old man, so I’ll tell you this. I got orders wherever there’s a family not moved out—if I have an accident—you know, get too close and cave the house in a little—well, I might get a couple of dollars. And my youngest kid never had no shoes yet.”

“I built it with my hands. Straightened old nails to put the sheathing on. Rafters are wired to the stringers with baling wire. It’s mine. I built it. You bump it down—I’ll be in the window with a rifle. You even come too close and I’ll pot you like a rabbit.”

“It’s not me. There’s nothing I can do. I’ll lose my job if I don’t do it. And look—suppose you kill me? They’ll just hang you, but long before you’re hung there’ll be another guy on the tractor, and he’ll bump the house down. You’re not killing the right guy.”

“That’s so,” the tenant said. “Who gave you orders? I’ll go after him. He’s the one to kill.”

“You’re wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told him, ‘Clear those people out or it’s your job.’”

“Well, there’s a president of the bank. There’s a board of directors. I’ll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.”

The driver said, “Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the East. The orders were, ’Make the land show profit or we’ll close you up.’”

“But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don’t aim to starve to death before I kill the man that’s starving me.”

“I don’t know. Maybe there’s nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn’t men at all. Maybe like you said, the property’s doing it. Anyway I told you my orders.”

“I got to figure,” the tenant said. “We all got to figure. There’s some way to stop this. It’s not like lightning or earthquakes. We’ve got a bad thing made by men, and by God that’s something we can change.” The tenant sat in his doorway, and the driver thundered his engine and started off, tracks falling and curving, harrows combing, and the phalli of the seeder slipping into the ground. Across the dooryard the tractor cut, and the hard, foot-beaten ground was seeded field, and the tractor cut through again; the uncut space was ten feet wide. And back he came. The iron guard bit into the house-corner, crumbled the wall, and wrenched the little house from its foundation so that it fell sideways, crushed like a bug. And the driver was goggled and a rubber mask covered his nose and mouth. The tractor cut a straight line on, and the air and the ground vibrated with its thunder. The tenant man stared after it, his rifle in his hand. His wife was beside him, and the quiet children behind. And all of them stared after the tractor."

I want to believe in that song
The weight of knowing
That's a false hope
Its almost too much to take
Every minute of knowing
The truth adds another brick
To the wall I'm holding up for you
This could be the last brick
The one that breaks my back
I would still do anything for you
But I hope you know
What I have to do
It's not about me and you
It's about him
He'll see us through"

Hear the church bells ring
Three chords and the truth
Donegan was king
I said Give me something
That I can use
Three chords and the truth
A shot of rhythm and blues

When the band comes through
Then you know what to do
Got to play the blues
Three chords and the truth
I woke up in the morning
And I heard the good news
Three chords and the truth
A shot of rhythm and blues

Three chords and the truth
Got to do everything

Before I went to school
Three chords and the truth
A shot of rhythm and blues
Three chords and the truth

Three chords and the truth
Baby, that I can use
Woke up in the morning
And I [learned?] the good news
Three chords and the truth

Baby, you got to move
Three chords and the truth
Got to stay in the groove
When your feet start dancing
And you just got nothin' to lose

Locust and birds ate the meat of your heart
The tears of your bones broken up in the shallows
Your babies bent back in a stillborn storm

Walk with me in the broken light
Walk with me through the flowers and the lies
Walk with me in the broken light
Severance severance severance

I was in a band called where’s my fucking phone
Stranded on a hillside of spectacular bodies
Mechanically dancing it’s 4 in the morning

Walk with me in the broken light
Severance severance severance"

Almost close, almost here"

Starting up the hill, an echo standing still
Love has turned on us like the wild
Listen to the scream of our desperate dream
Did we say forever and what ever did we mean?

Now, my friend, we're out of time
No more words, we're out of time
Someone take me out of time

I dreamed of eyes like his, open windows
Secrets looking through, dark sky burning blue
But I kept them to myself, quiet pieces
To the urgent voice, violent with choice
Did we say forever and what ever did we mean?

Now, my friend, we're out of time
No more words, we're out of time
Someone take me out of time

Where is the door I can't open
Hiding the still of the
The end comes before the beginning
I'm falling
Tonight I'll leave you there where I found you
Starting up the hill, an echo standing still
Our shadows cry for us as the dust moves
Time won't tell us why we let love go by
Did we say forever and what ever did we mean?

Now, my friend, we're out of time
No more words, we're out of time
Someone take me out of time"

Picket signs ain’t gon make change
Learn your principles
You repping revolution, but work for the institution
When will you declare your destiny?
When will you obliterate all that associate
With the forged realities of the day
Insubordination is alive
Young africans, you are blinded
There will be no resting in peace
There is no alternative
Re-evolve until you’re uneasiness is solved
Compliance does not exist
Hear the sounds of your alarm
No snooze with sooth the tears on pews

There will be no resting in peace

What is solution, when no knowledge
The problem, see, do you?

Stay choking, on my pride

Please know that,I'm inside my self

Your time to be through, with coon calling
I'm reading you, feeding you
Pleading you, wake up, wake up

Five more minutes, my dream ain't finished
I don’t feel like getting up today
The worlds too cold, don’t got clean clothes
I’m too scared to face the truth today
But I still gotta get up, 'cause my dreaming tells me so
Reflecting truth and fate like divination from the soul
Its tiring but better than a wake like funerals
They tryna keep me sleep and dumb
'cause thats whats comfortable
Catching zzz’s while their alchemy eating pupils closed
And I’m not living life asleep so thandi’s staying woke
[Hook: Thandi]
Stretching, yawning, feening
For the comfort of your sleeping
Stretching, yawning, feening
For the comfort of your sleeping


[Verse 2: Thandi]
Picking and choosing when you conscious like narcolepsy
Thinking you equal in the pot that they say is melting
Saying you righteous but you pray at the masters church
And when you're told bout yourself you get your feelings hurt

[Bridge: Thandi]
Face the truth
Find comfort in the day
Sun will rise and dreams will fade away

[Verse 3: Thandi]
Served my sentence
I'm glad that’s finished
I see the world is waking up today
Folks too bold, old spirits growing
Shining light upon the truth today
But i still got to get up, 'cause my dreaming tells me so
Reflecting truth and fate like divination from the soul
Its tiring but better than a wake like funerals
They trying to keep me sleep and dumb cause thats whats comfortable
Catching zzz’s while their alchemy eating pupils closed
And I’m not living life asleep niambi staying woke

8927,"Listen all your lovers and would-be lovers to my tale
The moral of the story is not hidden
Though there are some lies along the way to disguise the details
The broad stroke of this picture shall render its true meaning
I first collided with Geraldine on a Tuesday I believe
It was so very long ago still I remember
She just drifted by my window while I was pretending to be me
Not yet realizing I was already forever changed by seeing her

Into the cafe on the street where the faux French girls fake their slang
While trying to sink their teeth into each other
And all of them so dainty they must fan themselves all day
Claiming the breath of the walking deathly homesick G.I. sufferers

Geraldine sat alone of course nobody knew her name
But I watched her from a field of wallflowers
I can't remember why I ever started hanging around that place
All anybody ever did was dream of dreary California

The second time I saw Geraldine she asked me for a light
She was trying to read a map in a shattered doorway
I asked where she was running to or from or was it who
She asked if I was talking back or moving forward
Soon we were doing everything we could do to fall in love
We tumbled from the trees into the water
For awhile we were as close as the light-bulb and the moth
Bouncing off a wall as it grew hotter and hotter

But one day I was tempted by a fleeting song I heard
Whispered from the mouth of a passing stranger
Who said everything happens for a reason and I deferred
Not yet realizing I was already very much in danger

The walls were yellow and thin and there was no window I could open
And she just laughed into her pillow until she cried
And because it was a loathsome thing I did it once again
With a mirth that was disposable and a lament I couldn't hide

When the stranger disappeared I couldn't stomach my face
What will I do now that I have betrayed Geraldine
I cowered through the market and purchased every angry grape
And made a wine so bitter even the drunkards appeared clean

I woke up on a Sunday and Geraldine was boiling milk
""You've been far away,"" she said as if convincing me
""I am further still,"" I said, ""than you may really want to know""
She raised a finger to her lips to say I should be listening

""I've been where you stand,"" she said, ""once I was woeful and careless
But I believe everything happens for a reason.""
Well there it is again, I thought, and ready to confess
But she said ""Only the guilty are ever really innocent."""

I've waiting for you for so long
I will be standing
Right beside you is where I belong

Here, under the waves of the oceans
Into the arms of the mountains
Since time immemorial wishing
Listening for whispers of your return
Breathing the fire your light still burns
The beacons through histories turning page
Eons of empty the wars I've waged
Just to be with you

[Chorus]
I have been waiting
I've waiting for you for so long
I will be standing
Right beside you is where I belong
[Verse 2]
Here, into the ether you disappeared
Through the silence ringing clear
No momentum
Each beat of my heart turns a thousand years over
My burden is ballast, crucified sober
The weight of an endless sleep
When yours is the soul I keep
To wake from eternal sleep

I will wait forever (Just to be with you)
Until the ties that bind us sever (Just to be with you)
I will be waiting for you (Just to be with you)
Just to be with you (Just to be with you)
Until the time starts anew (Just to be with you)
Just to be with you (Just to be with you)

Livin in a life worth livin only some of the days?
Workin hard nights, hard stripes from all types
No rights but pardons, we live within the system starvin
It's determined how they show us lookin like we live in luxury
The struggle's been forgotten, while we stay in misery
This fucks with me, like I'm doin nothin when the trouble seen
I pay the cost to lose my life to see forever's glean
Dream a little dream and hope we'll make it somehow
Need to take all our resources, and join forces
The cause is not the fault cause we don't try and reprimand it
We define the dotted line, so FUCK these niggas speakin slander

I start my verse by sayin FUCK Guilani
And if you got a problem kid, you know just where to find me
I'm tired of this shit, cause each and every single day
I kneel down and I pray and then I wish, to a false God
That forgot that I exist -- then again, fuck the world
The whole world's tellin lies, never had anything to happen
To make me ever feel otherwise -- cause everyone that I know
Has tried to run me through the dirt
Which makes my life more complicated than transexuals givin birth
So don't you step in Pri way, unless it be your D-Day
That time of the month, sex backed up, and I ain't ate in three days
That's right - I'm up here bitchin
And I'ma keep on gettin louder until somebody out there listens
With no pot to piss in

The American school system
Plead resistance from my prison sentence
Wanted to shackle up my thoughts and said I needed penance

I see million dollar rap videos
Showin me what I be missin but nobody takes that money
To start an educational system - we need to build our own schools
Without no hesitation -- FUCK the board of education

I expose the untold and draw it out in paragraphs type bold
Or, maybe lay it on the line then build a boat
Like plastic gold, it's always rotten and
After facts are forgotten it's
You were wondering who unleashed the plot that's quite monotonous

Conspiracies of a thousand different ghettoes
Which wouldn't be so bad if the roaches weren't used
And immune to Black Flag, females livin trife kid
Don't see how you bother, chickenheads be havin babies
Just to have a baby's father, coupons in effect-ah
Food stamps they be doubled if you look inside my cabinets
They look like crossword puzzles, but for now I'm pullin hours kid
Just waitin for the day, that I can shout out KISS MY ASS

Oh, no – not quite

And despite what pretty poets say
The night is only half the day

For the story is not ended

And burnished by – the sun!"

I wish you would get up with me at 6am and watch The Simpsons
Nothing better than a nighttime show in a daytime world
I wish you would stay up with me ‘til 2am and watch The Today Show
Nothing better than a talk show host in a nighttime life

Well, the daytime world and the nighttime clash
And I’m amazed to find you listening
Cause it’s a hard time comin’ when you want some English tea and I want beer
So just hear me out when I tell you the advantages of the nighttime life
But it’s the daytime when the sun comes out and the rain comes out at night

I wish you would get up with me at 5am and watch the sun rise
A lot better than staring at the screen and straining your eyes
I wish you would stay up with me ‘til 8pm and watch the sun set
Somethin’ ‘bout goin’ dark gets me sleepy at night

Cause it’s a daytime world in a nighttime life
And I’m amazed to find you sleeping
Just get up now and we could do some things that we usually do together
It’s 8am and we could do everything and we could be outside forever
But it’s a hard consolation when you can’t see my elation
For the simple things like weather
And it’s a hard time comin’ when I open my eyes
And you don’t wanna see the light
Let’s not fight, it’s fine, the sun’s out now
And the rain comes out at night

Well that sun beatin’ down on me, feels like a fever dream
Darkness through my window, best sight I ever did see

Chorus:
You know I got them daytime blues
And I don’t want that sun to shine
When I get back to my bedroom
I’m gonna stay up all damn night

Well I stayed up all night long just to hear that old bird song
But just as it was starting, Some Asshole went and turned the lights on

[Chorus]

Now you’ve been waiting for the morning to come
But I’ve been working all night ‘til a drink of rum
And I feel the heat of that burning sun
Brush against my head just like a loaded gun

Sun shining through my window
Birds singing in the daylight
Please darling, turn the lights low
Let me sleep until the moonlight
Now the one thing that always troubled me down to my cold black soul
That I won’t be around to see the sun get swallowed by a big black hole

[Chorus]

There ain’t nothing that I can’t see
If only that sun wouldn’t stare at me
There ain’t nothing that I can’t dream
If I wasn’t distracted by a sunny beam

Sun shining through my window
Birds singing in the daylight
Please darling, turn the lights low
Let me sleep until the moonlight

Sun shining through my window
Birds singing in the daylight
Please darling, turn the lights low
Let me sleep until the moonlight

The sky is only blue if you let it
But I don’t wanna die just lookin’ at the sky

Look at the waves, the floating caves
Look at the trees and ride the breeze
Look in your eyes, the wind is nice
Look at the sky, it’s floating by

Look in the air, it’s always there
Look at the sky, it’s floating by
Look on the wings, those pretty things
Look at the sky, it’s floating by
(Repeat 1x)

All I do is speak to you
All you do is let me through
Daylight brings the silent walkers
Nighttime brings the silent talkers
(Repeat 1x)

And it’s all there
It’s already there
In the streams beneath the mountains
In the streets beneath the mountains

I guess I shouldn't make a song for you
Why the fuck I felt like at home with you?
But sometimes home ain't 'bout 4 walls
It's just two eyes and a heartbeat
And you fucked it up on your own, don't ya?
I guess I should've shed a tear for you
But I ain't really had the time for it
I used to have a good heart
Now tell me where the fuck he at
I might have lost it in your bed
Babe I know I was young
And maybe I was stupid
Is it 'cuz I hate love that I'd rather fuck them groupies?
I came off as strong but the inner me was dying
Acting like nothing's wrong
Maybe I'm good at lying

Not to love me
Only when you were drunk
Only when you were high

Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
Throw cares away
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold
Ding dong ding
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air
Oh how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
On on they send
On without end
Their joyful tone to every home

Real is on the rise all of ya demise
This is who I am so ain't no need for a disguise
I have been advised by the greatest that made it, to do it
Living legends but you never knew it
This record was written right before I got on the stage
My mind racing reciting lyrics from pen to page
Bitch I bet I record this record on the red eye
Just because I said I was a Jedi, bust like Beretta

Pray greed never breaks another happy home 
Pray another kid never ends up alone 
One way road with my eyes on the throne 
Can't nobody stop it something like Capone
Been Playing ever since 13
Learn the rules to the game 
And the game becomes a routine 
Won't stop till I'm sitting in a limousine (Alpha on the track)
Family living higher than they ever been 

[Verse 1: ALPHA]

Luxury like they never seen
My dad's rolley riding 
Ma's home in the hills shining, my kids thriving
But you saying that's the dreams talking
That's the dreams talking the talk
The hustle walks the walk
Pray I never sleep like Michael on that propofol
Or like Whitney on that bath floor
They say every rise is bound to fall 
If money's a poison
Pray my soul stays pure till my final call 
One life one lesson one blessing 
Gotta make this shit count keep progressing
Know your dreams are attainable 
That's how I keep my mind untameable
Let them say you're incapable
'cause flames can only hurt you while you're flammable
Go back to where you came from
Bitch I was born here
Well go back to the corner store then 
Or wait you're a doctor?
Call me a doctor
'Cause I got the illest flow 
Feeling I'm the realist tho
Raised on the realist know on the belief
You gotta get it, once you got it
Gotta get more
'Cause when you stop they'll take yours
If you want yours, you gotta get yours
Make yours, take yours
Guarantee you imma get mine
And you can get yours
Just know that people on that path will try and take it
Got a dream, they'll try and break it
Got a path, they'll try and snake it
So grind hard on those around you
And maybe you can make it
[Chorus: Liberty]

Will I ever see the light
Will I ever know what's right 
I gotta make it own
'Cause all I got left is hope

Will I ever see the light
Will I ever know what's right
I gotta make it own
'Cause all I got left is hope (Aye)


[Verse 2: ALPHA]

They either imitating or they spectating
Talking on our shit not knowing
They can never fade us
Never overtake us
That's the detrimental danger to the imitator
By definition, they a step behind us
Spectators speculating on our next fall
Whilst we out working outworking those who said we couldn't
Said we wouldn't 
And when we did, said we shouldn't
But the lord knows what I'll do when I got a vision
Watching what I say when these fakes around me 
Gotta listen to the angels when these snakes surround me
'Cause snakes in the grass like I'm living in the jungle book
Rumble in the jungle 
Everybody wanna take a look
Catch a hook, but they'll run when you down 
Snakes become followers when you're wearing the crown 
There's no I in team
There's no team in I
Lone ranger till I die
Only way to survive 
[Bridge: ALPHA]

If they don't see it yet you know they gonna see 
Seen the game turn a friend into an enemy
Don't look back, 'cause I know these demons chasing me 
Wanna see me drown in a pool of Hennessy, jealousy
'Cause we being who they really wanna be
Put a tag on the beat, so you remember me
Turn a preacher to a fiend for a melody
One way trip for the fam thats a guarantee

If they don't see it yet you know they gonna see 
Seen the game turn a friend into an enemy
Don't look back, 'cause I know these demons chasing me

Sofa surfing 'til we made the flight?
The sum of our hangovers laid out before us
Stretched to where the desert touches sky

An autumn collapsed and the border's convinced
But I swear I've never been so far from home

Oh dispossessed house-guest

Well honey, you could cut diamonds on those lips, and that dress has sure stayed pristine
But you still lost

Hanging branches off your stories
And it's not like I don't think they're true
But they've all got the same plot
You get the badges, you get the booze, then you get the boys

Of being talked to a grown man in a childs frame (im just a kid)
It's like a childs mind that was elevated (I was smart)
Or like a grown mans mind that diselevated (haha)
That's why I celebrated
When I moved out of my hood
To another hood that was less hood (Hell to The Law)
My childhood was diseased at 12
The grown man would unleash himself
And I'm here
And 13 was the craziest year
I fucked around and meet Amy what year (goddamn)
A young nigga, I was stuckin' already
Wildin' out, I was fuckin already
And shortly after
14, my introduction to manhood
This man stood on his own 2 like a man should
And when they told me grandma passed away

I feel so bad to be without my homie
And ever since you've been absent, I've been so lonely
Why does life cycle around like a trophy?
Even though I know somebody took the time to warn me
That you can't be with me and it's just crazy
And every day I'm wishing that you could come save me
And I know a man ain't supposed to cry
It’s taken all the strength in my soul to say goodbye
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Akon)]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye (Say goodbye)
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye (Say goodbye)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by (As time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I feel you, sweetheart, let me talk to 'em
Yeah, how come they call it goodbye?
How come the good die?
See, I just get high and think of the good times
That I had with my pops, he was a good guy
How come the good die?? As I protect my mother
'Cause I'm her oldest son, and there are different worlds
And we in the coldest one, which one did granny go to?
And why do death come?
As my baby ask, ""where do babies come from?""
I tell her, ""where?"", I tell her ""why?""
And I tell her I love her until I tell her bye
And whenever I shall ever die, I hope you celebrate it
I hope you never hate it, and they say Heaven's gated
But I think I know the code, and let's get your life right
By the end of the road, that’s why I drive alone down memory lane
So if I crash, I hope you all remember Wayne, goodbye

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And everyday life rolls on (Every day of life, I wish)
I wish I could talk to you for awhile (I wish)
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
As time goes by (I'm wishin' as time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you (And be right here next to you)
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (It's hard to say bye bye, bye bye, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So come on, somebody sing it with me)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Wave your hands up high)
Bye bye (Hey)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for my peoples who just lost somebody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (So this is for everybody)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Just keep your hands to the sky)
Bye bye, bye bye ('Cause we will never say bye bye)"

Like i'm just damaged or something
Like I ain't working on nothing
And trust this all to real
And I ain't no how to feel
See I've tried to go to therapy
But that didn't help
I wanna talk about my problems
Not just master a skill
I wanna know that how i'm feeling
Just a normal way of feeling
And I ain't alone as I feel
Got done talking to Berg
Yeah he told me to chill
Told me you should find a church
Told me that would just help
But he ain't know that i'm scared
He ain't know that i'm trying
And that I'm laid up in my bed
Every night and I'm crying
Feel like I'm dying feel like flying
I feel like a waste of time
Pouring my heart
Yeah right from the star
And I hope that you see
I ain't doing this for you
Naw I'm doing this for me

That ass Imma rip it, bouta catch me a case
Don't discriminate on any race or age

[Verse 1: Dan Lee]
Let me tell you the story of the diabetic llama
He was a weird young cracker giving little kids trauma
Only 12 years of livin',  he made up his decision
To live as a fuckboy, man I swear I'll never get it
Making claims of an 8 inch dick, me and Don Juan made a plan to find out if it was a myth
(if it was a myth)

Small ass boy, looks like shit

[Verse: Canibus]
Yo, Houston to Earth, watch the Ripper crucify you with verse
My urethra to ya uvula quenches your thirst
Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk
Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapon search
Strap a bomb to one of your labels record clerks
And activate it as soon as they get to work
Ring the alarm, red alert, nigga it gets worse
Bypass security networks with select words
Megahertz make nebulas reverse till your head burst
Call the press first and ask them who got the best verse
Give me the respect I deserve
If you are what you eat, it's obvious I can't eat what I'm worth
Y'all niggas eat pussy and burp
The other half of y'all suck dick till your jaws and ya neck hurt
When you address me nigga end your sentence with, ""Sir""
Critics went berserk they ain't even heard my best work
See I broke into the mind by
Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hotwired they skulls
Yeah I earned the name Canibus, but what did it cost?
Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore
Niggas probably like, what the fuck he dissing him for?
Yeah he dissed me first but you was never informed
I'm one of the top five nigga, my shit is tight nigga
You heard it right nigga, I rock mics nigga
But the limelight isn't where I belong
The top four don't even look in the mirror no more
If they did I'd be in the mirror looking back at 'em
Ready to grab them, kidnap them and put them on my album
I rip jackers, Rip the time/space fabric
Loop the future with the past tense looking for patterns
Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons
And forced black men to pay taxes
Attack a wack bitch with counter tactics
Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling
Keep firing at you till you trapped in
Non-combatants scramble for helicopter extraction
While I'm back at Fort Bragg bragging
How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers
Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts
I found in the cabinet written in Arabic
Translate to characters one by one like Arafat tarot cards suggest
I make terrorist threats through your stereo sets
Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press
With an imaginary address, Cani's the best
Untraceable, your pictures unpaintable, canvas that's wet
Let me dry you off wit some of this fire I spit
26 years old nigga look how I spit
A microphone fiend since I was like 14
My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine, OK?
I'm reloaded, you fucking wit the wrong MC
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease to the whole industry
Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee
One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely
Nowadays a hundred bars ain't impressive to me
You stepping to me nigga do it intelligently
You wanna battle or you wanna fucking wrestle wit me
You ain't better than me, you just got an obsession wit me
Canibus hybrid, the cake icing of rhymeness
As I grow older I get colder like the declining climate
Of earth's environment, I'm entirely tireless
Rhymes come from my higherness of wireless dialect
Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs
Astrally project during heightened sex, chakras connect
Doctors inspect what they can't possibly interpret yet
That's why they revert to threats
They curse and throw fits
They like immature earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress
Lyrically I step on you, rip on you
Then I defecate what I just digested on you
I'm better than you, I'm better than you, I'm better than you
Just to get the chequered flag I'll put the pressure on you
Put the extra effort on you write a motherfucking letter to you
And your editors too, threatening you
Detective check your mail and your messages too
You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue
Execute the type of wickedness the devil approves
Which basically means I can do whatever with you
I'm a rap music mutant with a cool name
Misconstrue fame, but I spit butane
Blue flames out giant CO2 tanks
Demagnetize memory banks, enhanced, advanced
One of a kind like modern man's retina scans
Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps
What you want me to break first? Your jaw or your grill?
What type of spit you want from me? Sparkling or still?
Study law, Yale draw up my own deals
So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel
Spread the ganglia from Tanzania
To the flats of East Anglia, give up, you can't keep up
The man eater in a wife beater
Spreading Typhoid Fever through mic receivers with light reverb
Type in the right keywords, I might emerge
Takes a really nice nigga to incite these nerds
Niggas wanna see the gully in me, keep fucking with me
Never under pressure, I keep the pressure under me
Burn the weed
Drop a freestyle on the internet then watch niggas burn the CD
Upload a picture of your mum getting DP'd
I'm one size away from 13, believe it she peed
I'm the illest and its gonna be that way forever
Word of mouth is good but a mouth of words is better nigga
No body gets sicker than the Ripper"

No loophole trap

No more wars

It's a sinking house
We've just begun

The fog was lifting out of her mouth
As I awoke
A fire escape
Or a water arrival
We're just bicycle spokes

Churning away the time
Shooting it off to deep space
Well goodbye time
We loved you well
You're still alive
In the videotape
And the child's poem
We've just begun
Take off your jacket
And black tie
Collapse into a dream
Where the house lifts up
To the tree tops
And the clouds begin

Then I make a parachute
Out of the bedding
And make my stance
By falling down
Without deceit
No more wars
It's a sinking house
Well goodbye time

Be inclined to commit an act that's bold

One glance and live inside it one more time

Might know what it's like to slowly drown
Waiting for your world to turn around"

If I can’t have one more piece of pie, I’ll die!
So since it’s all decided I must die,
I might as well have one more piece of pie.

This is the main event of the evening
It's time!

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall

[Verse 1: Demrick]
This feel like Vegas at the roulette table when your number hit, wait
This really feel like when you get your re-up and you double it
Or when you give a bad bitch a good dick she fall in love with it
Got that fire green, go and crumble it
Playing pool side on some summer shit
17 Henny botttles later a masterpiece was created
Came a long way from pissy hallways and crackheads in the elevator
And when this drops there's no favors
Don't try to call, got no data
If you wanna show then show the paper
Girl you got neither, no later
Wait up, won't stop til my [?]
Know what this is, flow the sickest
Add it up, no division, know your vision
Niggas living like codependents
[?], rolling with it
High speed no limits
Prime time, no scrimmage
Is she mine? I'm in it
'Bout time I finish, let's get it
[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall

[Bridge: Demrick]
Thought they knocked me off, I made my way back
I'm coming for you niggas, that's a payback
All them dues you talk about, I paid that
From the Benz to the Range to the Maybach
Thought they knocked me off, I made my way back
I'm coming for you niggas, that's a payback
All them dues you talk about, I paid that
From the Benz to the Range to the Maybach

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall
[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Fuck them hoes, I never sweat it
Cause we real hippies, that's level headed
Some niggas forever stressing
Used to be the same way now we better at it
I focus on what's right in front of me
Working on it, working hard
But I wanna let y'all know I ain't where I want to be
Intellect less yes
I don't fuck with that but show these niggas comedy
Real thorough, love me when I'm gone
Peace to the family and honesty
Playing dominoes talking 'bout if man'll manifest a girl, I'm drama free
On everything I keep the queen going
Ass fat, how she fit them jeans on it?
I'ma lean on it then I...

[Chorus: Demrick]
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I ball
All I tell my dogs
Catch me when I fall
All I tell my broad
Is love me when I'm gone
Win, lose, or draw
I'm in it 'til I fall"
3320,"Love, I'm starting to bend
Why did you count me as a friend?
You said you're city's gleam
Wore your soul, tore your seats
Now I'm taken apart
How you flooded my heart
Love, I'm starting to bend
Why did you count me as a friend?

Love, I'm starting to bend
Why did you count me as a friend?
You said my city's glare (Love, I'm starting to bend)
Made you cold, made you scared (Why did you count me as a friend?)
And that love is a train
Where it stops, there is pain
Leave my conscience to mend
Why did you count me as a friend?

Love, I'm starting to bend
Why did you count me as a friend?"
1699,"Dance with me tonight
Let's invite the storm
Teach me how to live my life
In a place that once was warm

My kingdom by the sea
Holds a sinking wheel
It fights the streams and lives for dreams
That someday might be real

Breeze of winter nights
Like a rusty blade
Surrounded by a thousand eyes
Only leaves a rustling shade
Only time will heal
The spark inside my heart
Find the ground beneath my feet
Stop tearing me apart"
6513,"So I'm into breakin' rocks now
Yeah, I'm down with chopping trees
I am not the woodsy kind or mechanically inclined
But today, I built a house
I mean, for bees

Folks have called this game addictive
So I tried it out one night
I've been playing for a while now
And it turns out they were right

I have not seen my bed in 13 days
But I'm pickin' berries and I'm making mayonnaise
My cauliflower finally sprouted
And for some reason, I give such a shit about it

People made a lot of hay about this game
But now I get it and sweet Lord, I love making hay
So many things I never do
But apparently, in lieu, I star do
I give diamonds to my homeboys
And I'm workin' toward a wife
Peoplе like you 'cause of gifts
So I pass 'em out in shifts
I wish еverybody liked me, just like real life

Found some goodies in the garbage
Found a mouse who runs a shop
But the thing which I have not found
Is a way to make it stop

My phone has six hundred and three missed calls
But a cowboy wizard gave me drugs and I tripped balls
The feet are falling off the bunnies
Wait, what?
When I buy seeds, I blow like eighteen thousand monies

I'm in shambles and I have no good excuse
But I clear brambles and I brew potato juice
All these skills I don't pursue, well, they're finally comin' true
'Cause I star do

I just gotta play one more day
Gotta play one more day
Gotta play one more day
Gotta play one more day
One more day, oh, gotta poop
But it's on the Switch, so we're good
How is this so much better than Harvest Moon
When it's basically Harvest Moon?
A much better soundtrack, no load times, great goals
Adoption, inclusion and streamlined controls
I'd recommend this game to anyone, anywhere
Just as long as you've got fifteen hundred hours you could spare

So I guess this is my life now
And I've just stopped asking why
Maybe it'll be okay, what a way to spend a day
Fish and farm and chop and shop
And cry and cry and cry and cry

There's a twinkly little light I see
Maybe I should go to bed
I tried playing Stardew Valley
And oh wait, yeah, I'm dead
Worth it"
105,"We met, a part of two worlds collided
And although we were different; we were the same in many ways
Your womanly shadow is like sunlight to me
Your laugh, my medicine and your touch makes me complete
But do you love me?
Do you love me?
I wanna be with you; I wanna cherish you

But I have to go; I don’t wanna go
I got to leave; just don’t let me leave

Don’t let me leave
Just don’t let me leave
Please, don’t let me leave
Just don’t let me leave

Don’t let me leave; don’t let me leave
I don’t know what it is
I don’t know what it isn’t
All I know is that right now, all I can see is you in the crowd
Your eyes searching, they shining
From two worlds, what are in the odds in love finding?
The metronome to my heart:
Clicking and clicking, we in the same song
Knocking and knocking, my heart falls apart
Dreaming and dreaming - but wait I’m not
Vasoconstriction, the new inhibition
God look at the time, this shit is stressing
What can I do, there’s too much meaning?
Moving and moving, the meter keep ticking
Please make it stop, beginning the end
Bring back Pangea, continents mend
Insta on fleek and Snapchat streaks
Baby please jump out of my screen
Don’t let me leave; don’t let me leave
Don’t let me leave; don’t let me leave
You know what I want to say, but I’m too afraid that it’ll leave my lips in the same way as our last kiss
Don’t let me leave
Please, don’t let me go
Don’t let me go
Don’t let me leave
Don’t let me leave

What an evening, I’ll never forget
The sunrise of the Southern Sun
Brought the saddest day that I’ve seen yet
Plane flights and “I mights”:
15/04/18
It might be safe to say that I believe in fate
Cables and wires, keeping desire
I hope our connection never tires!
Whatever happens, I hope you know
You’ll always be the star of my show
So baby, please, don’t let me go
Don’t let me go

I don’t wanna go. Please don’t let me go
I got to leave
Don’t let me leave
Just don’t let me go"
9533,"People are always too polite
Mirrors flatten out, reverse your left and right
Hard to find out what you are
Self-delusion of eyewitness from afar

The old still think they're young
The sad still think they’re happy
The damned still think that they're the ones who're free
Give me eyes to see

Got no markers to live by
No commitments that I have to satisfy
Tell myself it’s all okay
But everybody's living life some other way

The old still think they're young
The sad still think they're happy
The damned still think that they're the ones who're free
Give me eyes to see

The whiter your lies the less you're [?]
The bigger the lies, the more narrow eye sees through
Try to keep my vision clear
Trace it as I find, open and sincere
Seems the right thing till I lie
Down at night and hear a little voice reply

The old still think they're young
The sad still think they’re happy
Delusion or despair is facing me
Give me ecstasy"
307,"[Verse 1]
And with the rain, a stranger came
His eyes were filled with love and pain
He ate and slept 'til darkness fell
And in his sleep, his mind did tell

[Chorus]
Of green circles
Green circles

[Verse 2]
He dreamt of circles in the air
And you and I and everywhere
He wanted all the world to be
As free as he so they could see

[Chorus]
Those green circles (Circles of)
Green circles

[Verse 3]
His face was worn, the lines they told
The dust and patience of his load
And with the dawn, he went his way
And with him went his love and pain

And green circles (Circles of)
Green circles

Green circles, green circles
Green circles, green circles

228,"This morning i woke up singing about love
My thought was no one had anything on us
Ten steps backwards and we're still miles in front
Racing all of the people with none of their own

You and i will always be together
Even when the winters turn to falls
And you and i should always remember
Even when we're broken down and done
We will always, we will always

And i sang to my beloved that i found god
Smokin' a cigarette, laughing, at the other end of the couch
She said, ""no hearts are breakin' round here
Power beyond your control will make this clear""

You and i will always be together
Even when the winters turn to falls
And you and i should always remember
Even when we're broken down and done
And i suppose that there's no point in saying
But as long as mornings come and nights are long
We will always, now we will always have a song"
5987,"I fantasize about this back in Chicago
Who fuckin orders a fuckin baked potato
How do you say ""liar"" in Spanish
Me no hablo
Fuck the Friday blues, thats the motto

And I don't care what you say
I had a better day
All your fucking friends are lame
I'm glad I never came

I'm just a Chi-town boy with good intentions
5 am, West Lunt Ave, interventions
But where's your answers now?
You fucking fake friend
I drove all this way
Did I mention
You missed the good times
Nothings forgiven"
8232,"[Verse:]
I sat at a bar having a beer
Trying to hold down the stool
When a stranger walked in stood there beside me
And plopped down there like a fool
He started drinking then he started talking
About things that were wrong in his life
The more that I heard the more I believed
The thing that was wrong was his wife
You talk about beauty when we first met
She was all a man could desire
Talk about love one night with her
Would set your very soul on fire
But loves little flame is out of control
About three feet high from behind
Ever since we've been married well, I've come to believe
That love's for the dumb and the blind
'Cause you talk about ugly when she gets mad
She goes from Jekill to Hyde
She grits her teeth and her eyes roll back
And pivot from side to side
She completely rewrites the whole English language
Descriptive four lettered and loud
Now I can't out think her but I can sure out drink her
And that's what I'm doing here now
I've spent seven years with the wrong woman
Seven and going on eight
She spent seven years naggin' and eatin'
I'm overwrought and she's overweight
If I try leavin' she has me arrested
And takes her own sweet time gettin' me out
If she ain't number one she's in the top two
Of things that I could live without
Men commit murder and all kinds of mayhem
In a few years they're back on the streets
Highway robbery and white collar crime
And they laugh at the system they beat
Sometimes I'm tempted sometimes I'm ashamed
Of the things that the law will allow
I could have killed her when I first met her
And I'd have been out of jail by now
I could have killed her when we first met
And I've have been out of jail by now"
9589,"Wish I could see the future clear
I can’t see past another year
You know I find it kinda funny
I can’t see past--2020

The other night I had a dream
Where an old man appeared to me
He asked me “son, what would you see?
Where would you go with a time machine?”
Well I don’t know but the thought seems fun to me

Wish I could see the future clear
I can’t see past another year
You know I find it kinda funny
I can’t see past--2020

Well that old man was kinda weird
He pulled a car out of his beard
He said have fun then disappeared
So I climbed in and shifted gears
And pulled thе switch to travel forward 20 years
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

Well I wokе up before I’d seen
All the things ahead of me
Man I hated my alarm so much that morning
I tried to fall back into sleep
I tried to get back to the dream
But I guess some things aren’t
Meant for us to see
So I’ll have faith to simply just believe

Wish I could see the future clear
I can’t see past another year
You know I find it kinda funny
I can’t see past--2020

I can't see past
Can't see past another year

Never was a troubled kid until I started gettin in fights
Never had a problem in school until I messed up my mind
Was always a loser until I smoked some weed and now I have a life
Now all I get is money and cars, I got no reason to cry
Went my whole being told to go to school and get knowledge
Went the whole time thinking school was the only way to get a deposit
Set my whole mind on tryin to be some fat ass who sits in an office
And gets paid to type shit on a computer and gets a naggin boss that's non-stoppin'
They say rappers never make it son, better knock that shit off
You keep tryin to be famous, you'll be the whackest thing to fall off since Chris Cross
They say I'll never outta Quincy tryin to do something in Hip-Hop
But in Quincy, I'm at the very tip top
Was always told to sit still and get good grades
Maybe one day, I'll get a check that's large and looks great
So when I got to where I'm at now, I left everyone in a shook state
So before I go, I'd like to say Fuck You and have a good day"

Gods of war and fallen kingdoms
Prayed for it in times of decay
A curse of the unity of the undead
Has reached the poisoned souls
Middle ages time of the pestilence
Cruelty of unreached thrones

Pestilence!

Worms and rats attack your brain
You stare at the sun as you pray
Pray for help but it's stupid cause you know
There ain't no help for you
Death draws near and
You fear the smell of armageddon
But you've got no chance to escape
You will die in hell!

Hear the screams of children around you
No one cares about that crime
Terror rules the decayed land
The master is watching all the time

There must be a parasite in their brains
Terror is their only aim
Gods of war and fallen kingdoms
Prayed for it in times of decay
A curse of the unity of the undead
Has reached the poisoned souls
Middle ages time of the pestilence
Cruelty of unreached thrones
Pestilence!"
8573,"[Verse:]
Divided cause I did or didn't talk enough and then
In the deep, deprived of sleep, I caved in
Out of sight out of mind out of ways to care
When you finally looked you saw a stranger standing there

I remember we were hipsters..
Sleeping with our cats..
Young and thin and fucking crazy
Fine till something cracked
And we're not much stronger

Seems the more we have at stake the slower we respond
Give me more the back is for the weight of all upon
Till I decide I can't abide what I was asking for
And blame you for the burden , claim the burden was a bore
What’s wrong with wanting
More than I deserve
But what do I deserve
The nerve
To ask for more for more to give away
In the end I won't pretend that every things all right
What I deny will crawl inside and keep me up at night
Sleep is all we ever wanted
Deep to be restored
Face the day with will to change
What's wrong with wanting more [x2]

More than I deserve
But what do I deserve
The nerve
To ask for more for more to give away"

This kingdom of darkness
Trying to control these shaking hands
Confront the sun that has burned our skin with seven screams
Like question made awake our own sun, the sun of greatness
The sun of the cursed

Burning heart, immortal way to our midnight lunacy
From the ashes of the scum came true love
Oh sacred moon!!!
We spit our names not like servants
Just to remember what we are
'Cause before that gods, before that humans
We were, we are, we will be forever!

Burning anthem for the forgotten abyss of crimson irony
Honor to the ashes of our warriors
Entry point for breathless desire
Confront yourself testing the true conception, brotherhood!
Confront to our glorious path you messenger of light
'Cause we'll be forever!
In ancient times so pure, pestilent remains in today's reflections
'Cause we'll be forever!

Test our value shadow maker creator of ancient disease
Confront us in the mirror of eternal circumstances
Hell gate confront the light
Opening the doors of chaos
To the flesh to weakness to my hand
Awake our sun, the sun of new breathe, the sun of the cursed -
Awake our sun, the sun of new breathe, the sun of the cursed -

Always such a state doing ket with your best friends

Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone
Take another drag
Hope we never grow old

We're waiting at schipol, an airport which is nice
Build a small scale model, inside schipol airport
A commemoration of all the reasons why
Build it out of paper, build it out of plastic
Tiny little airplanes, don't think that they will fly
Triple finger knitting, red and yellow mittens
Lots of errant britons, we get down to knitting
Rubbish small scale model, lacking any detail
Forgot to add the runway, forgot to add the sky
Where is all the sushi, where are all the giftshops
Where is schipol airport, people cannot buy
Lovely schipol airport, reducеd to wool and paper
No one will want to go therе, genoa will thrive
Tiny little schipol, made of wool and paper
Replaces proper schipol and dutch politicians are held to account"

Send a man round where you stay at

I've still got ones in the cage trapped
I was on the seventeenth floor on my face flat
Now I'm in the Gardens with a bag full of straight cash
Patek with the rubber strap, more than your gold watch
Fill up a duffle bag, shut down the whole block
Still in the gutter akh, can't turn my phone off
Never done the trap to run a stack to a broke fuck
Ran through like a hundred carats already, hammers and jezzies
I need lobsters and some spaghetti
I put my hands on him, he didn't hand me my readies
Girls say I'm handsome, I had a handful of Presi's
My Roley Anniversary, pattern like Burberry
The plug got birds for me, my hitter gonna burst for free
Tryna turn a leaf, my CV extensive
Lifestyle expensive but I need burners cheap
I don't do AC's, I don't do A3's
I'm known in the AD's, got bored of the AP's
Haters still mad at me, VVS clarity
Round up the cavalry, I'm buss down casually
Rapping about sports cars but you don't drive any
Team full of all-stars like Kenny
In the hood I'll burn a bridge for a ice bezzy
All the work I flipped made my life messy
Fiend hopped in my whip, said the Benz crazy
I won't stop till I'm rich, old friends hate me
When you water like this you need your skeng daily
If I pay cash for five I'm getting ten maybe
Ends snaky, full of trench babies
I just flicked my wrist and it went brazy
Firing up, let me get some rap money, try my luck
Three mixtapes in 2020, am I live enough?
You ain't got bars like me
Clothes, hoes, rose gold, cars like me
Your boy got clapped and your team didn't slide
You was on the track screaming ""R.I.P.""
Coke boy, born in the crack era
Friends turned to foes, I need my strap nearer
You can still get a square from man

Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on a farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

Wretched are he who sees the word
Holiness so well rehearsed
Dollars signs in the faithful eyes
And a saint's Sunday disguise
You're just a faker
No miracle maker
Holy behavior
Won't make you a savior

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on a farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water

The water
The water
The water

Money made messiahs
You're televised to tell your lies
Not another a martyr
You're dead in the water

If we want a martyr
We'll come and find you
Come and find you
Done before you started
You're dead in the water
Walk on a farther out to sea
You're done before you started
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water
You're dead in the water"
9166,"The Story of the Three Hunters

Be the work good or bad, we cannot tell what may be said of it, nor how far its result may spread.
Tibetan Proverb.

ONCE upon a time, when the world was young and men loved and hated as they do now, in a mountain village there lived three brothers and they were hunters. Each of the brothers had married a wife, and they had one sister who lived with them all. One day they went out to hunt and brought in a deer. When they had all the meat they wanted to eat they gave a leg bone to the sister, who cracked it, took out the marrow and toasted it, so that it looked very good. As she sat eating this delicacy, the wives of the two elder brothers became very angry, just why it would be difficult to say. They were so angry that they decided they would plan some way to kill the sister. They said, ""The brothers think so much of her that they won't consider us at all, so we must get her out of the way.""

Again the brothers all went out for a hunt, and the women decided now was the time. The wife of the younger brother would have nothing to do with it and told them it was the wrong thing to do, because the sister had had only her share of the meat. But the wives of the two older brothers decided to kill her anyway. When the brothers were coming home they stopped on the way to rest and a little bird in a tree kept singing and singing the same tune over and over. Finally one of them said, ""That bird seems to want to say something to us, I'm going to see if it does, for it sounds like my sister."" He went up to the tree where the little bird sat and said, ""If you are my sister, hop up on my hand."" The little bird hopped on his hand and they all began to cry, because they knew their sister was dead. They went on home and found the three wives, but the sister was gone. They said nothing about her being away, but later they found the younger wife crying and she wouldn't tell why. They told her they knew why, as they had seen the sister, and her soul had gone into a bird. So the young wife told them the story, and they were so angry that they killed the two big wives and had the third in partnership."

Take advantage of our good will

My knees started to break
When we locked eyes my heart broke into two

4819,"[Verse 1: Skeptik]
Can the same object exist in two places?
I’ve seen plenty people rocking two faces
Identical concepts erased ‘em, replaced with
New moving parts and shipped to an oasis
Now they’re both afloat but there’s no hope
No point to row, there’s nowhere to go
But what if someone in the know showeth no current or a go with the flow?
Take this ship apart, rebuild it again
Fix the old bits when they break and bend
Salt from the sеas, the salt from beneath
Liеs through the teeth are often believed
Keep the same shape, just switch out the frame
Shit’s not the same
Let’s not shift the blame
Nowhere to shift it
Lost a random misfit by virtue of existence, materialistic

[Chorus]
How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?
How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

The way it shifts
Day to day

Every cell in my body new
Got new work, got new hobbies too
Different shit that I’m vibing to
Different shit that I’m tryna do
I’m the sum of my parts, stomach the heart
Brain in my skull in the dark
None of it there from the start
All of it gets replaced so where do I start?
A name is a label enabled to make any mark
In this argument take it apart
My memory’s just a one man game of telephone, it’s like art
Identity’s on shaky ground
Don’t think about it, don’t play around
And if you start that up, don’t make a sound
You ain’t John Locke or Descartes
You don’t get paid to go wrestle with these questions
They for professionals
We can’t rename every vessel on the dock before they embark
Does Marx or Jean-Paul Sartre get any closer? They supposed to be smart
Maybe it’s meaningless, we just impose plots and character arcs
[Chorus]
How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

How many things have to change?
Now I’m not the same as my name
Isn’t identity strange, the way it shifts day to day?

The way it shifts day to day
The way it shifts
Day to day

[Verse 3: Illogic]
Every time we look in the mirror, do we see who we are or who they made us?
Blinded destiny, impressions be the currency used to abuse and enslave us
I’ve been watching how the outlet showcase the loss for clips
And we fall in the trap, just bored, we react to the wack while enduring the bliss
Never take for granted the advantage you have to not listen to what they’re feeding you
There is choice involved, don’t panic, but reflection is referenced by what’s in your feeding tube
So who you gonna be today?
What mask are you gonna rock?
It’s okay to show your face, stand behind that private stock
I take a drag from my flask and laugh
It’s just a blast from the past enhance
I can give myself a chance
Best lay the other plans
I’ma stand, be a man, I am who I am
We dance for the crowds, we're allowed to
Never understood where to find you
It’s never been a jigsaw, read flaws
It’ll change what you amount to
They’ll never doubt you again with the pen, take a spin, my friend
It’s not the end"

While I step to the stage in a daze, ready, release
Settin’ loose the soul, hands gripped tight on the microphone
Whether it's right or wrong, or ready to get it on, gone
Into the innermost chamber of love
The music's a drug, it's keepin’ my heart from gettin’ numb
Livin’, walkin’, and talkin’.  Singin, hopin’ that Lord will it
Children under the sun, dance ‘til the sky spinnin’
Listen or know—never.  Tougher than good leather

Together, tight-knit to the sweater

Of wisdom to the globe, piercing earlobes
With jewels real heavy, yet steady when you rock it
Love for my b-girl, I'm comin’ out the pocket
Captivated by life, created on paper
I bomb with the off-on that's sworn to escape the
Narrow gates of hate that conquer man's nature
Man in the mirror still shy ‘til I face ya
Head high, hold ground, and speech is my major
Supreme rock graduate, got pens to stab you with
Poetic sketches of pain that rain, thoughts immaculate
I chronicle my life for toll
I grasp my path, this pen I scroll
See, only God knows what the future hold
But still, I take cover ‘cause this world is cold
This world is cold

I grasp my path, this pen I scroll
See only God knows what the future hold
Man I take cover but this world is cold
Yo, this world is cold

Forfeit my injured soul, this affliction I respire!
Heal this restless spirit – that bestowed naught
Heal this heart that approached the world, as I relegate – I consign!
Heal my heart, my weeping soul...
I consign this putrid flesh

Nothing here, nobody there...
Erroneous illness shouting
The outcry reviles this tattered soil...
Drowning the world in filth and distortion

Forfeit my injured soul, this affliction I respire!
Heal this restless spirit – that bestowed naught
Heal this heart that approached the world, as I relegate – I consign!
Heal my heart, my weeping soul...
I consign this putrid flesh
I’ll leave my conscience to die
A barrenness of dreams and anticipation;
Life and hope shrivel into the void

Heal this heart that approached the world, as I relegate – I consign!
Heal my heart, my weeping soul...
I consign this putrid flesh

In this pantheon of sorrow
We are everything, yet nothing!
And as long we’re breathing
The burden devoid of conclusion!

Unaided I slither – ravaged, silent and alone
I smoulder in anxious strife; I decline these exhausted remnants of decay
The world is coming to an end; a vast ocean of disease...
All hope is lost... or perhaps this is the cradle of salvation

I must tranquil these turbulent waters
No more expressions shall leave my trait...
No further words shall be spoken
This illness they conceived broke my tired wings"

Early morning take flight, late nights you moving
You never complain you say someone’s gotta do it
Baby you're a dream, you deserve a good woman
Someone to compliment the effort that you put in
Someone to add to your vision, not blur it
Every time you call I will be there in a hurry
Every moment spent with you is so valuable
You're my man I want everyone to know it

But everyting cool when they check me
Because I'm so cool and deadly
See, I had to realise slowly

But I am so not phoney
They try to disrespect me

See them online, they're vexing
They see the shirt I'm flexing
They see my spliff get larger
They see the girl I'm sexing
I'm a Nigerian eagle
In London smoking illegal
Nah, we are so not equal
Them man are cloning people
Anything I do, they bite
How do you sleep at night?
Is it codeine and Sprite?
I switch up the steez on guys
I stand up in the rain, I'm dancing
Then I look at the game, start laughing
It's not a joke, though, got the fakes in a chokehold
I'd love to see them gasping

Greaze!

[Verse 2]
I declined some amazing dinners
And I'm still blazing Rizlas
I wanted to make some changes
I was not taking pictures
Now look at the labels dying
Nobody else is signing
We know the truth they're hiding
See, the plaques on my wall just shining
And I've already seen my death
We were the last ones left
I saw the whole hood get gassed
I had to hold my breath
I was a young black yout
The teacher took my zoots
They tried to show man Roots
They tried to send man loops
Now you have to respect it
I've been around the world, I'm tried and tested
Getting back money that I invested
Don't know about me? Get connected
No, I don't do that conscious rap, but
Man still know about Wretch and Kendrick
Top five niggas, don't get offended
Murdered the beat, no, it ain't attempted
I meant it
And I'm still top three selected
They never showed me the guest list
Nah, we just walked in the exit
Just came back from the Ivors
And look at what we collected
The MBE got rejected
I'm not tryna be accepted
[Chorus]
They try to disrespect me
When they're online especially
But everyting cool when they check me

6724,"Verse 1 (Ekcelent):
I stand here on my own, like a soldier on the battlefield
I was exiled, I’m denounced and misunderstood
Not taking any sides, doesn’t matter who you vote for
Blue, or red, I’m a deceived voter

You’ve driven me away on the outskirts, from the distance
I’m looking at the mess you left behind, farewell
You have painted a picture, and that’s a fact
Fabricated the evidence, just like in Syria or Iraq

That’s why I’m staying in the back and learning to survive
In your web of lies, I would rather not live
I have my own world, truth is my credit
Not the private data, Mark Zuccerberg’s a scoundrel

You got exactly what you wanted here
I won’t be imprisoned in your cell
My codex is truth, I don’t believe you anymore
I’m relying on myself, I am my own commander
Verse 2 (Realita):
I know the truth and I want the change - that’s why I’m the threat
Truth holds tremendous value, the hunt begins
On those, who know it, they wanna hit them like a home run
We are outcasts on the brink, the unaccepted kind

I never liked authorities ever since I was a kid
Because I knew very well that they weren’t right
Prescribed opinions directly to the heads
Those who didn’t accept them, have become rebels

The system has branded us as extremists
They’re just afraid of truth and that’s why they say it
Ever since I was a little kid, reality hit me hard
I knew very well that the karma will turn around

Wasn’t waiting on a miracle
I’m swimming against the stream, as was once Labrak
Path with the masses in not the right one, they thought I was crazy
Humanity is blind, just a step into the void

If you wanna behave how they tell you
You will end up there real quick
But if that nonsense bothers you too
You’re like me, let’s call ourselves brothers
Verse 3 (Ekcelent):
I’m an outcast, they laugh at me because I know more than them
I’m a convict, at least that’s what the media say
Modern Odyssey, my will made from Iridium
Modern technology is like a Trojan horse

Freedom of speech dies every day
Political correctness is like a shadow
They wanna ban us from speaking out, ban us from having guns, to kneel
Brave New World, like Boy Wonder said it

Humanity is on a brink of a new era, new age
Beating on its own chest, being proud of its achievements
The more things have changed, the more they stayed the same
In a country where the people are just slaves

Of foreign corporations, the World Bank
If a country won’t submit, they will send the tanks in
Free like the Beacon, Slovak like Militia
I am the citizen of Earth, I’m but a truth seeker"

A rock n' roll band
I couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm doin' everything I can
I thought I had it made
Strangers drop in
And pretend they're friends
People I don't even know
I want you, I need you
It's so hard to tell
And what you're really feelin'
Won't show

Don't abuse me
Now you listen to what I say
If you're tryin' to use me
Why don't you just go away

You took me around
An' you showed me the town
I thought you were kind of nice
But if someone stepped in
With more to show
You'd drop me without thinkin' twice
You tie yourself to my apron strings
Thinkin' your friends will be impressed
You get your way by bribin' me
Tellin' me I'm the best
Don't abuse me
Now you listen to what I say
If you're tryin' to use me
Why don't you just go away

Who can I trust an' where can I go
To find someone who truly wants me
Take me for what I am
That's the way it's gotta be

Tellin' everybody you're mine
But we both know deep down inside
You're just diggin' for every dime"

Crawled right in and buried myself deep within
'Cause now I've got new socks
And I'm holding myself in
When I'm told it does begin
To feel like something all to often
So I seem to forget
I seem to hold my breath
To feel the thumping in my chest (Oo, hoo, Ooo)

By now it seems like it might have happened to me
Everybody here looking at me weird
So I wondered

Looking for something that might have mattered to me
Everything here looks to me to be
All in order

All in order it seems to be
'Til cautiously I go

Around the corner, where nothing will grow without a
Kind of water that they don't know about
The plants think the animals are ruining everything

I'm still hopin' that someone could tell me
I sit here prayin' that somebody knows
I keep on wishin' that someone could tell me

5937,"Transfixion, a sickle to the neck
Disfigured by the malady of man:
Time, prevailing
A cross to bear; our end

Finite, our fascination
With death, to behold
Our lives in consecration
We dwell, in the halls of the night

Transcending the path
With our crosses to bear
Transcending the path

Finite, our fascination
With death, to behold
Our lives in consecration
We dwell, in the halls of the night

Opened wide unto the core of our being
Poisoned minds, in the gyre turning
Unlatched inside, the gate is swinging
The pain subsides but the fire's still burning

A cross to bear

Perpetual
This sallow affair
Interminable

Intertwined and locked in despair
Obsessed with death, the affliction we share
Gashing out the jaws, the visceral sound
The heed the call
The call from the underground

Consciousness
Suspended in stone
The blackness
Calling us home

We are but sirens with our crosses to bear
And the stones to cast out into the air
A faction bound by possession
A faction bound by aggression

Our cross to bear
Our cross to bear
Weight, the burden
A cross to bear"

Fuck yo face up
We making money but trust me it ain't never made us

Everyday and I grind for the foundation
Going hard everyday cause

Until money's mined in

Till i find it
I keep one eye on the task
On some private eye shit
And the other on life
Sleep is for when I'm dead
Heard em say life's a bitch and then you die
I'd rather make her rich and let her ride
Till the wheel fall off, fuck getting by
We turning up, let it rip, hands to the sky

Die trying is the least
I'm fresh to death head to feet
Obstacles land a my feet
Doubters your head is my feast
I got my head on the cheese
We up like a springboard
And the sky is the peak
See money's all I'm trying see

Increase my
Networth by atleast 5
Digits cause I need 9
Figures pass the trees my
Money stays on the mind

She saw at me at a bar, at Empassant
I moved like a pawn who's chasing a swan
Who's singing a song, a real bad song
I feel it each day but I do it my way
And I turn on the radio, and I hear the voice of Tammy Faye
She says: ""Reach out, reach out, friend, for my sake""
When my life don't seem so sweet
Imagine a baby bleeder on the toilet seat
And realizing that your time is slow
Imagine a soldier in Iraq getting his head blown off
If in life it seems you can only fail
Imagine a poor boy whose getting raped in a prison cell
And you can have your cake, and you can eat it too
Pushing right into there that's Jericho
Thank God either way
The Lord and Savior and live it each day
When life starts to seem so sad
Just remember it ain't so bad
So pray to the Lord that they may survive
Cause we're only here for a little while"

I sat at the table
And it was clear

I’m her Knight of Cups

And she cuts off my head
She cuts off my head
So just my heart is left

I’ve seen a whole lot
But God damn, those eyes
And when she sings
My doubts capsize

Off with my head
Off with my head
So just my heart is left"

Though I never laid a hand on you
My eyes adored ya

You couldn't see how I adored ya
So close, so close and yet so far

Carried your books from school
Playin' ""make-believe you're married to me""
You were fifth-grade, I was sixth
When we came to be
Walkin' home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay
Till we grew into the me and you
Went our separate ways

(Chorus)
Headed for city lights
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame
I worked my fingers to the bone
Made myself a name
Funny I seemed to find
That no matter how the years unwind
Still I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss
And the love I left behind

(My eyes adored ya)
All my life I will remember
(Though I never laid a hand on you)
How warm and tender we were way back then, whoa, whoa, baby
(Like a million miles away from me
You couldn't see how I adored ya)
Oh, the feeling, sad regrets
(So close, so close and yet so far)
I know I won't ever forget ya, my childhood friend

She said baby please just leave me bleeding

There's no way you can help me
Out of the spiraling void
Descending into the well

I'm losing the sky, I'm losing my voice
Can't see the light, down here there's only
Black Noise
My senses disappear
I can not see or hear
There's no escape to the light
Locked in a cage of fear
There are no ladders here
And all reality dies
I wake at the darkened hours
There is no end to this game
They've taken the sun and flowers
And left me with only pain
Descending into the well
Deeper and deeper I wall into hell
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my voice
Can't see the light, down here there's only
Black noise
And now, just for a moment
I return and see
The clarity in what you gave of the world
And I feel
Something new
But now it's taking me back down
And so i make a final bow
To end the rein of
Black noise

Well, it's another Halloween here in the fabulous Forties. Everything is better than ever now. And we've got some amazing new wonders around the house to prove it. For instance, out refrigerator hold more food than ice cubes. And thanks to our new automatic dishwasher, I don't have to dry the dishes anymore after supper. Give's Rover and I more time to enjoy out evening stroll together.

(Rover barks.)

[Father]
Later boy. (to Audience) Oh, and here's something else that's new. I just heard a new term today on the radio. Fellow says, we've got something now called the 'rat race.' Did you ever hear that one? It sure describes my life. I'm involved with something now called commuting. I drive into the city for work all day, and then turn right around and drive all the way back. And the highway is crowded with other rats doing the same thing!
[Mother]
That's what they call progress dear.

[Father]
Ha ha ha ha. I guess she's right. But we do have television. When it works. Gives you something to do after you get home. I kind of like it, you know? A guy named John Cameron Swayze gives us all the news and then they have all this singing and dancing. A lot of fluff, but it's fun. You know, I predict that day that millions of people will learn Latin and Greek sitting in front of their TV sets.

(We see Grandma and Grandpa watching TV.)

[Grandma]
Are you awake dear?

(Grandpa snores. Grandma changes to channel to a boxing match.)

[Grandma]
(to the TV) Give him a left, you big lug!

Ah yes, a new age of electronic civilization is upon us!

Hey dad, what do you think of my jack-o-lantern?

Oh! Boy, is that scary!

That's 'cause I used my beautiful sister Patty's picture for a model!
Ha ha ha.

Down Rover. Jim, Rover appreciates your joke.

[Mother]
Now... you're always kidding poor Patty. She's certainly prettier than
either of you.

You hear that? My daughter Patty is using that old exercise machine she rescued from the attic. It was all the rage in the Twenties. Grandma of course had to have one. Didn't work then, doesn't work now. Consistent at least. Makes a lot of noise and blows fuses.

Oh Patty, are you going to the Halloween party tonight?

Oh yes. And I'm hoping to lose a couple more inches by then. I'm going with that dreamboat, Wilfred.

[Babs]
Wilfred?! What a slug!

[Daughter]
He's coming as the headless horseman.
[Babs]
It fits.

[Daughter]
Come on Babs! That clodhopper Howard you're going with is no Crackerjack prize!

[Father]
Oh poor Howard. I wonder what they said about me when I was dating Sarah.

(The cuckoo clock rings. Rover barks.)

[Father]
You're lucky Rover. You don't have to date. Well, we're caught up in the do it yourself craze these days. We're remodeling our basement as something called a rumpus room. And we're looking forward to a few rumpuses I'll tell you, as long as they don't get out of hand.

(Mother is seen applying wallpaper to the walls.)

[Mother]
John, this papering is getting out of hand. I could use a little help.

[Father]
Now Sarah, didn't I set up that clever automatic paint stirring machine for you?

[Mother]
Yes John, you're a genius. Of course this will ruin my food mixer, not that you'd care.

[Father]
Oh good old Sarah. Always the last laugh.

(Mother shrieks.)

[Father]
What happened Sarah?!

[Mother]
Oh you and your progress! That paint mixer of yours just sloshed paint across my rump...er--rumpus room.

[Father]
How do you like that? I always say, if you're going to be married, marry a girl with a sense of humor. Well, it's time to move on. Let's cheer up Sarah by singing our song. Come-on. Everybody!

[Father & Chorus]
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow,
Shining at the end of every day.
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow,
And tomorrow is just a dream away.
Man has a dream and that's the start.
He follows his dream in mind and heart
And when it becomes a reality,
It's a dream come true for you and me.
So there's a great big beautiful tomorrow,
Shining at the end of every day.
There's a great big beautiful tomorrow,
Just a dream away."

4344,"Taken away from under the boughs
Far from the sheltering glens
Imprisoned by wizards to sing for a serpent
In the guise of a man

They come with teeth and tusks and talons
They come with horns and hooves and claws
A wailing cry is heard deep within the forest
A bestial host heeds the king stag's call

Watch them come from lands all around
To hear the maiden in white
Sing her songs of sorrow and love
In the hall of the king tonight
She was stolen from under the boughs
Away from the sheltering glens
Imprisoned by wizards to sing for a serpent
In the guise of a man

In a wood untouched by axes
Creatures dwell unseen by men
Songs are sung by a virgin princess
Heard but once and never again
They come with teeth and tusks and talons
They come with horns and hooves and claws
A wailing cry is heard deep within the forest
The bestial host heeds the king stag's call

Watch them come from lands all around
To hear the maiden in white
Sings her songs of sorrow and love
In the hall of the king tonight
Soon the herald shall sound the alarm
As the faery queen's armies draw near
And the maiden shall cease her lament
As the wicked men cry out in fear

In a wood untouched by axes
Creatures dwelt unseen by men
Songs were sung by a virgin princess
Heard but once and never again"

Anybody give a shit?
Anyone who's suffering?

A lotta bit depressive

Had to stick and move, now I'm moving (On)
How to be spell, how you do it (Gone)

I haven't gone too far
I miss the way we were back then
How we laughed
I can feel you in my heart

There's a world in your eyes I can see it getting brighter
All the hours that we turned into days
We were young seemed like life would go on last forever
All I had was you by my side

Some day you will answer
Remember how we were
When all our hopes and dreams
Floated in the air
I feel it in my heart
I can feel you in my heart

That's the way that it was in the past you remember
When we ran through the wind and the rain
We were young seemed like life would go on last forever"
599,"Retribution, just solution, there's no other way
Haunted by your actions of which you have yet to pay
Caustic bursts of filth that just spew out of that mouth
Bone splitting cold now that you have been locked out

Egotism, disillusioned, can you see the end
Seditious to your family and seditious to your friends
Tears of joy were shed on the day that you were born
On the day you'll die there will be no one there to mourn

And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn

Childhood choices, adult divorces, you have paved your way
Strike another lady lover, see how long she'll stay
Embezzle money, coward, phony, you have brought this hate
Brought this hate

Abomination, deviation, start another war
Brothers stay and fight as you flee out the back door
Isolation, desolation, mercy I will lack
Cherishing the day I lay you flat out on your back
Flat out on your back

[Solo]

And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn

Childhood choices, adult divorces, you have paved your way
Strike another lady lover, see how long she'll stay
Embezzle money, fucking phony, you have brought this hate"

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Every day i tried to tell you

My soul´s still hungry...

I’ll take your forevermore
Bringer of Agony... Die by the Demon’s Claw

Frozen memories of what they did to me are ripping me from inside
Am I born to kill???

Tell her don't compromise
Don't meet in the middle
And I don't mind if she got
Some meat in her middle
Tell her don't worry yourself
Shape and size don't determine health, and
Your extra insulation's
Not gonna cause any dick deflation

Takes a lot more than a pound or two
For me to stop hanging around with you
And if you don't likе your looks
Let me set you a challеnge:
Find a woman who doesn't get shook when she stares in the mirror
Or mutter a prayer to be thicker or thinner
Your body doesn't define you
But I got love for whoever designed you

That was a genius move
Giving you a back the size of your boobs
And if you wanna change that's cool
But if you wanna change promise me it's only for you
'Cause I wouldn't make any changes
Nah, I wouldn't make any edits
Anyone tells you you ain't my type
Just slap 'em and tell 'em I said this

How i stumbled into you in december
When i was feeling out of place
You put a smile upon my face
And with no warning, no escape
I touched your lips again, again and again
Though i never knew your name
I feel no regret, no shame
Cause that mortal kiss
Felt like one i'd hate to miss
The few words i heard you say
Seemed profound in every way
And now all that remains
Is the hope that i will see you once again
Your touch was gentle, your voice was so tender
But you walked away in all your splendour
I didn't hear you say goodbye
And i asked with no reply
For your number, for your address
So i found myself in limbo when you left"

7171,"Greetings my name is Charma Im somewhat of a speculation
I am from a far and Earth was set for the Destination
Please don't try and spit this flows not trackable so no tracing
Please do not try this at home this power is not a play thing

So deadly that you would have thought this power came from Satan
You should of known its written that this Charm is from your graceness
My poetry stems from that flower in the Pavement
And Im gettin better every hour in the making

Demons try to temp me and place me in harms way
Jesus keep me safe and at bay this is Charms fate
Fake friends they want to race and erase me its all hate
When I just know that the world will embrace me its called faith

And Im well aware of exactly what Im capable of
The last thing Im worried bout is how Im makin a buzz
Who goes to church anymore we think we graceful enough
Nowadays around the world it feels like Satans the Judge

And you can't make it without haters feel like hatings a must
My generation tryna make it filed with hate growing up
And we can make you sick man
Emo kids with pale skin cuts under their wristbands
Shit man

All these snakes and don't get bit damn
While we play tug of war up in the quick sand

Its a dog eat dog world no pedigree
And who ever is ahead of me is looking like a shred of meat

In this religulous world its hard to find a friend
Feeling like the only Christian stuck inside a Lions Den
Redirect the flames they throwing like a fuckin fire bend
And Ima love all my haters like my Messiah said

And that real power
Its called will power
And we gon scrap the sky like the Willis Steel Towers

Michael Jackson said beat it and prayed you guys ignore
The violence the streets will feed us you live and die with swords
Janelle Monea told me freedom is what we fighting for
Its a cold war better know what your fighting for
In this cold war all we is are some dinosaurs

Soon to freeze over
We need Jehova
And if the flood coming
Best keep your Jeans roll up
I just pray im here to see my seeds grow up
And I just pray im here to see the League blow up

True power the answer is something felt
Take a look in the mirror can you master you own self
Disregarded this disease like cancer on some shelf
Told them not to sleep on me now im hazard to they health
The more heat that I release the faster the fakes melt
Born to be a beast but being a bastard was great help

Trust me
Im feelin lucky
Im Charma and nothing but thee
Got the power elephant from Uganda couldn't even crush me
Titus late gorilla king of Rawanda is who I must be

Beating on my chest
Preaching out my testimony

My bibles my strap continue to pray
For the decade

Rap religion is back this is the crusades

So what do you say
Mama warned me of Devils like Bobby Buche
Never too late
To give him the glory this is a new day
Also the calm of the storm

As Charma spits his revolution this the art of the war
Be careful which side that you choosing cause its starting to pour
Look up in the sky I can see them vultures starting to swarm

I see them prowlers
Devours
The enemy will steal the gifts god gave to empower us and leave us defenseless

We feel heavens so far away
But Jesus burns inside my heart and my tongue when I speak his name so.."

My visions clear, despite this fear
With or without heart, I'll embrace this hell
Destiny awaits, So let's go
I won't be stopped

Side by side we fight
Side by side we die
Forever together we'll fight for our lives
Everything is falling apart
Side by side we strive
Side by side we rise
So never stop dreaming or else all is lost
Hold the lines and we will prevail

Adversity is my new fucking passion
I won't be denied

No matter how hard I fall
I'll get up with a fucking smile
And once again
Strive to seal my faith, over and over again
And again #4
Side by side we fight
Side by side we die
Forever together we'll fight for our lives
Everything is falling apart
Side by side we strive
Side by side we rise

Hold the lines and we will prevail

Adversity is my new fucking passion

653,"Hold it tight 'til it's quiet
Hold it still 'til you don't cry about it
Shove this pillow against my throat
Cariño, you know how badly this will go, don't you?

Time is tight, it goes tick by tock
So talk to me
The clock is wound too tight to
Demand your company
Hey, spray paint the black trash gold
Tell me something quick before this gets too old, right?

Hard to start rolls too slow
I know exactly where you do not want me to go
The Colorado River's just three hundred miles away
From Utah, where the Badlands can't be blamed

Here I am in the desert alone again
There's no one here except my thoughts
And the man in the back of the truck bed
I know, I know, I know I should have gone and bought a map
But I guess out here it doesn't matter
What happens now
Hold the lighter a little lighter now
Until it plumes and the campfire has burned out
Denver's not so far from New Mexico
Still I know this is farther than you wanted to go, right?

Here I am in the desert alone again
There's no one here except my thoughts
And the man in the back of the truck bed
I know, I know, I know I should have gone and bought a map
But I guess out here it doesn't matter
What happens now

Hit hands harder 'til the lightning claps out
Thunder rolls under a single dark cloud now
We drive this road here for hundreds of hours
I swallow the road whole so my thoughts are all, um, devoured

I didn't have to fly but I'm here in the terminal tonight!
You're texting me back just to say, ""Hi""
You want to get dinner, but you left me there to die
Are you kidding me? I've got to go, I've got to go, I've got to go
Tonight"

Cuz I knew someday I’d have to let you go
I'm supposed to raise you to have the strength to leave the nest
But the day that you leave this home my heart will leave my chest
Just know I’ll always be here every time you need to rest
Back into my arms again

In my heart I’ll always hold you cuz you’re still my baby doll
My darling, I’ll protect you from it all
You’ve been learning how to walk away since we taught you how to crawl
But someday I'll be holding hands with the shadows in these walls
Just know I’ll always be here every time that you fall
Back into my arms again

The last time that I held you I couldn’t catch my breath
I knew that it was time to let you go
I gave you your roots so I had to give you wings
But watching you fly away is a heartbreaking thing
This old house is way too quiet, I miss hearing you sing
Come back into arms again
I’m not the kind of person who’s good with goodbyes
So I’ll just save you a seat at the table again tonight
I made your favorite recipe but it just wasn’t the same
If I could you know that I would do it all again
I choose to believe that good things never end
Come back into my arms again"
661,"The best dream I ever had
Floating on the liars blood
I came to the throne
And my reign was made of glass
And mirrors that reflected souls
Built upon the tomb of falsehood
Be warned
Henceforth
Everyone will pay for lies
With his own life
Less is more
Never mind what people say
Precious words
Silence is golden
In this masked world
Double cross empire
Have I any hope?
And the crown was my third eye
Shining like the morning star
Blinded enemies
My sharp tongue against their swords
Mirrors that reflected souls
Built upon the grave of honesty"
4331,"I remember you sitting there alone
Lost in a sea of something you couldn't call your own
The fault of little things we lost long before
So tired to even reach out, reach out for the door
We were so naive, we were so naive, we were so naive, we never wanted this
Close your eyes for a field of peace that only we will know, we'll know
Don't you sigh for we'll be the ones to come out, come out golden
I remember just how closed-in you felt
Well, today is a new day and a new hand has been dealt
Our past may have pardon but there's peace for us at last
We're in the arms of something bigger than our past
We were so naive, we were so naive, we were so naive, we never wanted this
Close your eyes for a field of peace that only we will know, we'll know
Don't you sigh for we'll be the ones to come out golden, you'll know
Close your eyes for a field of peace that only we will know, we'll know
Don't you sigh for we'll be the ones to come out golden, you'll know"
9605,"I'm the one who you said wouldn't make it
You said I was supposed to be out

Now I know you simply can't accept it
‘Cause I'm the one they're talking about

What goes around comes all the way back around
What goes around comes back around

I often stepped into the muddy water
I often went astray

I made mistakes, I made some people cry
But I never let my faith die

I know how many times I let down my love
I got to know it way too late

You say I want to punch above my weight
I'll get it right this time
I’m doing fine and I’m on the run
I’m feeling shivers going down the spine

A fresh start's all I need as I'm gargling bleach
Will this get my chakras all clean?
Hope so, soap, soap, my love could use a lather
Morals mixed with mud need a scrub
Blow away my bones with a bath bomb
Sentence me to sop in the suds
Feel like I need to shower for eternity
Society so dirty, someone get me clean internally
Wash me in detergent 'til it's burning me
Water boilin', joining her in serving me the third degree
She's right, I mean, I'm surely better than her last man
Probably better than her next man too
But these taunting tainted tracks I've marched,
Left the bottoms of my feet so black like tar

Tar in my lungs, soap

Scrub me from the inside out
Brush me from the inside out

I feel stained from the smoke
Think my brain need a bathtub
Think my veins need to soak
Lemme drain all the bad blood
Let these bars clean (no soap)
Let your heart bleed (no thanks)
Secrets haunt me (no ghost)
Lemme come clean (no chance)
We stay out late
But when we fill up, we don't fill up like a gas tank
We fill up like an ashtray
She's real and blunt, she cut up me up
Feel like she spilled my guts on the park bench
Pardon me darlin', I guess I left that part of me
Sparta imparted in the Garden State, still charming
But darkened is being hardened involved in evolving Darwin
Spark restart it, get this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving artists, eat this soap by the carton
Just for all you starving-

We've been fighting like cat and dog now here's what we've go to do
This life in the city is killing the love that we one knew
We could be happy in the country

We would spend so many lovely days
We'd have chickens and cows and corn and whatever it is farmers raise
At breakfast each morning we'd fry up our own hand-picked eggs
We could be happy in the country

So let's pack our bags up together
And we'll be in the clear forever

We'll just sit right back and watch while our crops grow
While we listen to gals like Kitty Wells on country radio
Weekends we's two-step at some cowboy bar just down the road
We could be happy in the country

I know that the local folks will make us feel right at home
We'll have homemade whiskey and ramble down country roads
And I would learn to ride on the rodeo
I'd have shiny boots and a cowboy hat so that nobody'd ever know
That we'd once been city folks that owned sporty cars and fancy homes
If we could just be in the country"

I'm a Jehovah's Witness with no arms

I'm Rafiki in a dashiki
Sex simba, I mufasa
Brother lion to the king he a coon I'ma Ta Ta
Scar him, swallow slugs like Pumba
When I'm stressed out I do a woosah
I'll flip a dub to a bird like the Wu sign
Them little piggies killed my dad out in Tucson
They ain't know that nigga's son was a wolf God
I burst shotties
Bullet holes O.D. in the middle of your body like the word body
This a purge party
I'ma bring the can in like its BYOB but I thirst hardly
Ima burn Marley Over your body
Puff, drop ash on tee Like Irv Gotti
Ink murder like cephalopod poison
My voice is just weaponized noises, Batta
I was born on July 21st
If I shoot you and you live you a cancer survivor
I'll burn a Mac in your back
Like the dead black comedian's ambulance driver
I screw ratchet hoes for the nut
And then bolt to twist up please hand me the pliers
You got a sack? I'ma make you all red
Put a cap to your head like Santa's attire
The Devil's just God in a ski mask
Leave you stiff for the base like freeze tag
Red dots when I squeeze mags
Batta turn a pale face to a fucking Japanese flag
That shit sound Mike Tyson on a speed bag
Bbbrbrbrbbrbrbbrbrbrb you can keep that
Shots rectum, lick lick they eat ass
Your red blood looks so pretty on green grass

I send shots across heads like lent time
My Trigger is a clitoris I hit a G spot
Anytime my finger get to flicking it's a sex crime
I'm circumcised
But I'm 'bout to have my foreskin re-attached so I can fit the work inside
Or I put a zipper on my scrotum
The cops come I fill it up with coka
I'll take a hit of acid to the face like a misbehaved Arab woman
Crush a couple qualudes in a pack of puddin
I wait til she go to sleep then I smash her puss in
Hit it so good she wake up she glad she took it
Cops blasting bullets
They can give black man a red neck, nigga that's an afro mullet
My plug is like a couch cuz he has the kush in
But he don't let me in the kitchen when that crack is cooking
I want a Bugatti like Mickey Ward's fans
My wrist game so strong like I got 4 hands
I'll restructure the floor plan of the Lord's land
If I have to waste another day as a poor man
Bitch I'm too lit
I'ma dilate my nostrils and hit this 8 ball like a pool stick
Sniff sniff snort ooh sniff
Whip whip whip, I need a new wrist
The deuce spit at you dudes with loose lips
Then I jet with a goon dough like Bruce did
Fuck a Consequence no Q-Tip
Young X boomer to your back I'm a new pit
I'm a stoner like a caveman
I can hold a blunt and light it with the same hand
I can break down glass and make sand
I can see the words in the numbers like Rain Man
When you pray you end it with an amen
When God pray he end it an A-Cam
I can stare straight at the sun with no rayban
All that bull shit in the Bible's a straight scam
Generate, Operate, Destroy
My job description on this planet I'm employ
If Eve ate the apple I'm a fucking android
Satan whispered in my ear when I was just a little boy
Told me step out from the silence get adjusted to the noise

Gods grab guns when they're annoyed"

Reckzy made a man jump like hurdle
Backed it, tryna reach man's internals
Said he roll with the bwap bwap (Vah, vah, vah)
They ain't ever put their hands on a thermal
She said you won't find a girl like me again (Mmm)
That's the whole point, duh (Bitch)
I need more stack, you a snack
But I'm more into the racks though
They marathon like Man TV
Think I ain't on they're [?] Diablo
Three of them man were shanked like jambo
He dashed off when he sighted the rambo

She keeps saying it's giving
What's it giving?
I don't understand these TikTok women (What's it giving?)
Said he's a bad man, it's not giving
Rap 'bout drills, you ain't do no drillings
(Fast gas killing my people)
Bronem got the fast gas, now she's giving (Brain)
(What's she giving? Brain) (What's it giving?)
Likely a ching if I step with a-
She keeps saying it's giving

I don't understand these TikTok women (What's it giving?)

You've exhausted every part of me

'cause you wanted every woman in one
So on Monday I give everything'
On Tuesday you want more
On Wednesday I obey so you won't walk out of the door
On Thursday I accommodate
Fridays I compromise
In weekends I just do it over twice
Cause I want to stay together forever
When will it be enough
I should just let you go, but I'm addicted to your love
But loving you is no more fun
I'm every woman in one
Every woman in one
Your 'every woman in one'
You've got me wrapped around your finger
So you know I'm gonna linger
As much as I'd love for you to stick with me
I'm not going to lose my dignity
I changed so you would want me
For love I just gave in
But much to my despise, you criticize my everything
I'm making my own money, I'm smart, I make you laugh
But it's no longer funny living life on your behalf
Forever, forever, no... never!
I'm walking a thin line, but still I want you to be mine
I'm every woman in one
Every woman in one
Every woman in one

Suspicious actions that you think nobody sees
I'm having fun
Watching my friends fall in love
You can't deny it, can't deny with a straight face
You try to hide it while you're driving to his place
I can't help but blush
Watching my friends fall in love

Not stealing your moment

That something has changed and I can't look away

Why don't you ask the man on the moon?
For one reason why it couldn't be true
And the hurricane eyes see light in the blue
And it could crash, it could burn
And he could leave, leave you hurt
Drag it out, or with her, not once
But I think it's fun
Watching my friends fall in love

You keep it quiet, don't get too far in advance
At 3 a.m. I catch you gripping honest hands
And do [?] he says ""Do you wanna dance?""

Around 1986 a new trend emerged called ""androgyny"". ""Ge-ge-ge-gender benders"", as they were also called, stretched the perceptions of what it meant to be male or female

Hemurfadite...hemurfadite...hemurfadite, hemurfadite

“Everything is just an impression”

And the response is obvious enough
But the point is a useful one
If you take it for what it’s worth
The soul of man does violence to itself first
When it does its best to become an abscess
A kind of detached growth from the world

To be vexed by anything that happens
Is a kind of secession from Nature
Which comprises the nature of all things

To be vexed by anything that happens
Is a kind of secession from Nature
And it comprises the nature of all things

The soul of man does violence to itself
When it turns its back on another
Or sets out
To do harm
As the souls of the angry do
When overpowered by pleasure or pain
When it puts on a mask
And does or says anything insincerely and untruly
When it allows its action
And impulse to be
Without a purpose
To be random and disconnected
Even the smallest things ought to be directed
Towards a goal

And a journey far from home
After fame is oblivion
What can guide us?
Only philosophy
Which means keeping the demon in man
Free from violence and unharmed
Superior to pleasure and pain
Doing nothing without purpose
No hypocricy
Randomly or dishonestly
Not dependent on any man
Doing or not doing anything
Accept what’s happening
Accept what’s happening (faded)
And all thats allotted as coming from thence
And above all that it accept death
In a cheerful spirit
In a cheerful spirit
And as nothing but the dissolution of that from what it is made
If it doesn’t hurt the individual elements to change
Continually into each other, why are people afraid?
Of all of them changing
Separating
Its according to nature
And nothings evil that’s according to nature
Nothings evil that’s according to nature

The body and its parts are a river
The soul is a dream and mist

Our love will surely end

Don't you know that our love, yeah, yeah
Is in double jeopardy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, tell me, tell me, baby

[Chorus]

Lay with you
Stay with you
Pray with you
Play with you
I wish you'd
Play with my hair

If they can't get you
If they miss you
If they diss you
Well that's they issue
I just wish you'd
Play with my hair

[Verse 1]

Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Lay up when life'll wear you down
Imma hit the text like ""Where you now?""
If you let me in I'll wear you out
If you let me in I'll wear you out
If I'm in the box I'm there for rounds
Flex on your friends. I'll cancel my plans
It's morning and I ain't prepared to bounce
Play with my locs you'll get me open
In the same boat and your ocean soaking
Toking dope? I never was a smoker nope
But now your floating got me wanna okey doke it
I'll hit that after I hit that
Ignore invites to that kickback
If you sore then I can assist that
Rub your sore thighs and that six pack
Yeah I'm a chunky guy and you dig that
Rub belly I'm a lucky Buddha
It ain't nothing to you
You don't complicate it
No relationship but when we fuck we boo'd up
She could teach me shit I never substitute her
The moment I'm needed I'm there
Forbidden fruit with my tongue in her pear
Head on your chest while you play in my hair
[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Minutes hours days I could lay
I could stay here
Put your phone on silent it could vibrate
And we can't hear
Fingers in my hair I don't care if I got shit to do
I ain't been around. Outta town I been missing you

Minutes hours days you could lay
You could stay here
Put My phone on silent it could vibrate
And we can't hear
Fingers in your hair you don't care if you got shit to do
I ain't been around. Outta town I been missing you

Mop the sweat from my successful brow
If they could only see my face
Taste the riches in my hiding place

If they could only catch me up
Drink the dregs from my gold plated cup
If they could only watch me grow
Catch the trickle from my overflow

Heartbreaker – counting coins in the bedroom
Breadmaker – running lives through my fingers

If they could only pick my brain
Find the licks that drive the chicks insane
If they could only get the knack
Of putting fillings back into the crack

In the pieces of time they give to me
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/pete-brown-piblokto/thousands-on-a-raft/if-they-could-only-see-me-now-parts-i-ii.html]
I'm sitting on the shelf
In the corners of sky they let me be
Knowing I’m by myself
In the corners of time they let me be
Knowing I'm all alone
In the pieces of sky they give to me
Know that I'm on my own

O when the wagons frown the laughter drowns
That’s when I find time
O when the lights are low I have to show
That time is all mine

In the corners of time they let me be
Knowing I'm all alone
In the pieces of sky they give to me
Knowing I'm on my own
…Knowing I'm on my own"
2855,"Set fire, set fire to home
Burn in your chair
Let fall, let fall your Rome
Limight your cares

Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
Wither and die
As another day breaks from the light

You've rewired, rewired your code
Spirit betrayed
Now you drown
Just to stay afloat

Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
Wither and die
As another day breaks from the light
How do you see your self
On your one way ride?
How do you breathe in half light?
So wrapped up in your self-administered prize

Watch another chance to make things right
Crumble and fall by the wayside
Another chance to set things straight
You'll sink but you'll rise
It's alright, reach for the knife"

6401,"I know I've never dreamed the way I dream
But every night I'm haunted by your face
I used to spend my nights in peaceful dark
And now I wander blind from place to place

My love, I'm haunted by the dream of you
I find you in my mind
And though I know our summer days are through
I miss them all the time

I never used to dream of sweet romance
No love song ever reached my sleeping ear
The morning never swooned or sighed or danced
But now I find at dawn that you are here

My love, I'm haunted by the dream of you
If daydreams weren't enough
And though I know our summer days are through
I think I fell in love

My love, I wander through the night for you
As the stars and planets sing
And though I know our summer days are through
I'm living in my dreams"

Just stash the loot with crash bandicoot and half a suit

I’m part of a rager

Make the cracks in the blinds glow

Dug into my hip bones

I'm measuring out the time
The moments between the notes
I am the program
The method learned by rote
That catches in your throat
The lines of which you spoke:
Aware – I know it's there

When we combine
The machine and the mind
Another tool to optimise
Who's in control
And do you notice
The feelings that you process?
Or have you felt them before?

We're living in the samе times
Delivering thе same lines
And everyone's the same now
We're living through the breakdown
How much of you is you?
Regardless of truth
Do you own the words you use?
I am the caveman: refuse to know
My blistered body is in control

We're living in the same times
Delivering the same lines
And everyone's the same now
We're living through the breakdown

How deep can it be?
We'll never be the same now
And you can trust your body
But can you trust your mind?"

His swag and gear guarded by a faithful heeler dog
He wore a shirt that would blind ya and a rumpled ringer's hat
This old man was country, he left no doubt of that
There was legend in the lines of his weather beaten face
Those eyes had seen a lot of changes Aussie race
The passing of the horseman, the death of an ace
Seems to me he doubted, that we turned a better page
He sat there hillbilly pickin' on a cracked and battered Gibson
And the songs that he sang were all his
Every song told a story and the more I'd listen
The more I realized this is where country is
Well he sang of mobs of cattle moving down the Birdsville track
And the camels carting wool in the early days outback
He sang of wild eyed scrubbers ridin' flat out in the night
Tryin' to ring the mob, 'cause lightning's quick to fright
And he sang loudly and proudly of our pioneering ladies and
I suspect that one such lass was his
Home in this early frontier country,was lonely dirt floor Humphrey
No doubt about it, this man knows where country is
His songs told how they did it and I felt a sense of shame
And I wondered if the battler would ever be again
His pride for his country rang true in every song
And I wondered, if the chips were down, I would be as strong
He sat there hillbilly pickin' on a cracked and battered Gibson
And the songs that he sang were all his
Every song told a story and the more I'd listen
The more I realized this is where country is

It is so that my transgressions have borne a withered fruit
The sun has scorched the rising plants; alas, they have no root
The bleached bones of animals bound by leather strips
Dance through the air with laughter as I wield this wicked whip

[Verse 2]
As you did warn me, carpenter, this world has weakened my heart
So easily I disparage, self-seeking the work of my art
And there you've come to me at the moment I bathe in my sorrow
So in love with myself, sought after avoiding tomorrow
Where do you find the love to offer he who betrays you?
And offer to wash my feet as I offer to disobey you?
Your beauty does bereave me, and how my words do fail
So faithfully and dutifully I award you with betrayal

[Verse 3]
The weak and the downtrodden fall on broken legs
As I walk past, a smile I cast, fervor in my stead
My bones, like plastic, do buckle backward now
I lay in this field by Judas, anticipate the plow
I cannot be forgiven, my wages will be paid
For those more lovely and admirable is least among the saved
And where would I fit, Jesus? What place is left for me?
The price of atonement is more than I've found to offer as my plea
[Verse 4]
Jesus, my heart is all I have to give to you
So weak and so unworthy, this simply will not do
No alabaster jar, no diamond in the rough
For your body that was broken, how can this be enough?
By me you were abandoned, by me you were betrayed
Yet in your arms and in your heart forever I have stayed
Your glory illuminates my life, no darkness will descend
For you've loved me forever and your love will never end"

Hypnotic stare, you're drawn away

Fleeing to crypts at dawn
The terror for now will end

Arising from infernal tombs
And draining you of blood
Insatiable appetite not fulfilled
The count's feeding ritual undone
To keep warm blood on his lips
For centuries to come
Not to let the dead souls rest
A blood drained corpse when he's done

Returning to the coffin
Sanctuary from the light
Drifting to a peaceful sleep
Waiting for the dark of night
Looking to the sunset
As light now slips away
Spreading wings of horror
Locking jaws of death

Arising from infernal tombs
And draining you of blood
Insatiable appetite not fulfilled
The count's feeding ritual undone
To keep warm blood on his lips
For centuries to come
Not to let the dead souls rest
A blood drained corpse when he's done

Feeding on the minds of man
And lifeblood flowing through your veins
Stalking you with burning eyes
Then ripping out your brains
The bewitching hour midnight
Gives life to phantom form
Taking human souls
Beware you've been warned

(Coro:)
Arising from infernal tombs
And draining you of blood
Insatiable appetite not fulfilled
The count's feeding ritual undone
To keep warm blood on his lips
For centuries to come
Not to let the dead souls rest
A blood drained corpse when he's done

Each stone takes my world away
You tore down my dreamhouse

A ghost with ever changing name

Is it just a dream
Am I to believe
That it’s not for me
It’s the only thing
Been so close to see
What seemed so easily
The most perfect thing
Was not meant for me

How am I supposed to see you now
As just another face deep in the crowd
How could we connect so deep, so deep
And not drown
You are now another failed attempt
At me trying to see what could be next
How do I get everything back
That I put out

Is it currency
What can it bе
I can set the scene
Taste your everything
Give you all of me
Yet and still you leave

To who I was when I first heard from you
Isn’t that what made you approach me
In the first place
Tell me what’s so different, then from now
Don’t you like the way I hold you down
Or maybe you just can’t seem to let go
Of a bad space

Like I love you, like I love you

Do you want to watch a scary movie?
And maybe lay on the ground right next to me
Why do you act like you barely knew me?
When we spent one night in ecstasy
You got me so lost in my mind
I don’t know how much I can survive
I know that my timing is poor
So I’m willing to wait for
Tomorrow

(Verse)
I thought that you’d come back someday
And I kept asking when, you said maybe today
But today passed us by
Everyday of July
And I’d follow up and get no reply
Then the summer time ended and the thrill went away
And I’d miss you sometimes but had nothing to say
Then you’d say that you missed me
And I’d keep on listening
Cause I lost all my self control
You’ve done this to me all before
Are you playing a game?
Am I points just to score?
Or are you as confused as me?
Cause the way I see it, I just don’t
Understand
How things have came to be
I don’t feel like I’m even me
I know that you are what I need
But you’re past that

And I could have loved you
And you could have loved me
And I know I want to
So why don’t you stay with me

I’ll hold out a line
You’re my favorite time
I gave my whole heart but got no peace of mind

I’ll get off of work late at night
And I’ll sit in my car cause I’m too tired to drive
Then I’ll listen to Blonde
Putting on Pink + White
Missing summers that I used to like
Then I’d get half way through
And the beat change will hit
And I’d tell myself 11 is a good time to split
Then I’ll go over 15 on a 45 road
Even though I got no where to go
And when I pull up at home
I’ll sit in my driveway singing ‘bout Self Control
Then I’ll finish with Nikes
Laying back in my car seat
Wonder if you’ll ever want more
We got some secrets to hold
And I loved holding you when the studio was cold
Now I wish I went farther
I wish I did more
Cause ever single doubt you had in mind
Made you unsure
(Pre-Chorus)
And I could have loved you
And you could have loved me
And I know I want to
So why don’t you stay with me

Sometime tomorrow
I’ll hold out a line
You’re my favorite time
I gave my whole heart but got no peace of

Mind ain’t right when mouth is shut
You lost the time, I lost my trust
You wouldn’t let me love you but
I still wanted to
So what am I to do?

And you could have loved me
And I know I want to
So why don’t you stay with me

For a good time we chill by the mall
I tell her tales, some small some tall
Why, how you got peanuts, pecans
I wipe her cheek, she grabs my hand
I have a curfew, she says to me
I'll take you home, look hon, you'll see

Fullmoon in my eyes retlecting the death

Twisted trees clawing at the skies
Creatures of the night
Frozen winds trough the time
Whispers my name

Fly on my wings through
The darkest of night
Feel the pain and try to die
Never see the light before
Lost sour sense of a dying world
The black night before me
I stand socluded there
A godless portal to hell

I could see the gate
Rise before me
I entered the reign of death

Shadows appears in front of me
Painfull harmony

Through the winds into the night
I'll proclaim my life
Once again a voice calls to me
A shadow crawled along my side
Eyes of the night gaze at me
Dancing souls of minkind

Fullmoon in my eyes reflecting the light

Open to a bear, been bearing my soul

So we play pretense, each pretend adults

Though I have, in the foregoing chapters, shown how, from simple ideas taken in by sensation, the mind comes to extend itself even to infinity; which, however it may of all others seem most remote from any sensible perception, yet at last hath nothing in it but what is made out of simple ideas: received into the mind by the senses, and afterwards there put together, by the faculty the mind has to repeat its own ideas;— Though, I say, these might be instances enough of simple modes of the simple ideas of sensation, and suffice to show how the mind comes by them, yet I shall, for method’s sake, though briefly, give an account of some few more, and then proceed to more complex ideas.

2. Simple modes of motion. To slide, roll, tumble, walk, creep, run, dance, leap, skip, and abundance of others that might be named, are words which are no sooner heard but every one who understands English has presently in his mind distinct ideas, which are all but the different modifications of motion. Modes of motion answer those of extension; swift and slow are two different ideas of motion, the measures whereof are made of the distances of time and space put together; so they are complex ideas, comprehending time and space with motion.

3. Modes of sounds. The like variety have we in sounds. Every articulate word is a different modification of sound; by which we see that, from the sense of hearing, by such modifications, the mind may be furnished with distinct ideas, to almost an infinite number. Sounds also, besides the distinct cries of birds and beasts, are modified by diversity of notes of different length put together, which make that complex idea called a tune, which a musician may have in his mind when he hears or makes no sound at all, by reflecting on the ideas of those sounds, so put together silently in his own fancy.

4. Modes of colours. Those of colours are also very various: some we take notice of as the different degrees, or as they were termed shades, of the same colour. But since we very seldom make assemblages of colours, either for use or delight, but figure is taken in also, and has its part in it, as in painting, weaving, needleworks, &c.; those which are taken notice of do most commonly belong to mixed modes, as being made up of ideas of divers kinds, viz. figure and colour, such as beauty, rainbow, &c.

5. Modes of tastes. All compounded tastes and smells are also modes, made up of the simple ideas of those senses. But they, being such as generally we have no names for, are less taken notice of, and cannot be set down in writing; and therefore must be left without enumeration to the thoughts and experience of my reader.

6. Some simple modes have no names. In general it may be observed, that those simple modes which are considered but as different degrees of the same simple idea, though they are in themselves many of them very distinct ideas, yet have ordinarily no distinct names, nor are much taken notice of, as distinct ideas, where the difference is but very small between them. Whether men have neglected these modes, and given no names to them, as wanting measures nicely to distinguish them; or because, when they were so distinguished, that knowledge would not be of general or necessary use, I leave it to the thoughts of others. It is sufficient to my purpose to show, that all our simple ideas come to our minds only by sensation and reflection; and that when the mind has them, it can variously repeat and compound them, and so make new complex ideas. But, though white, red, or sweet, &c. have not been modified, or made into complex ideas, by several combinations, so as to be named, and thereby ranked into species; yet some others of the simple ideas, viz. those of unity, duration, and motion, &c., above instanced in, as also power and thinking, have been thus modified to a great variety of complex ideas, with names belonging to them.

7. Why some modes have, and others have not, names. The reason whereof, I suppose, has been this,— That the great concernment of men being with men one amongst another, the knowledge of men, and their actions, and the signifying of them to one another, was most necessary; and therefore they made ideas of actions very nicely modified, and gave those complex ideas names, that they might the more easily record and discourse of those things they were daily conversant in, without long ambages and circumlocutions; and that the things they were continually to give and receive information about might be the easier and quicker understood. That this is so, and that men in framing different complex ideas, and giving them names, have been much governed by the end of speech in general, (which is a very short and expedite way of conveying their thoughts one to another), is evident in the names which in several arts have been found out, and applied to several complex ideas of modified actions, belonging to their several trades, for dispatch sake, in their direction or discourses about them. Which ideas are not generally framed in the minds of men not conversant about these operations. And thence the words that stand for them, by the greatest part of men of the same language, are not understood: v.g. coltshire, drilling, filtration, cohobation, are words standing for certain complex ideas, which being seldom in the minds of any but those few whose particular employments do at every turn suggest them to their thoughts, those names of them are not generally understood but by smiths and chymists; who, having framed the complex ideas which these words stand for, and having given names to them, or received them from others, upon hearing of these names in communication, readily conceive those ideas in their minds;— as by cohobation all the simple ideas of distilling, and the pouring the liquor distilled from anything back upon the remaining matter, and distilling it again. Thus we see that there are great varieties of simple ideas, as of tastes and smells, which have no names; and of modes many more; which either not having been generally enough observed, or else not being of any great use to be taken notice of in the affairs and converse of men, they have not had names given to them, and so pass not for species. This we shall have occasion hereafter to consider more at large, when we come to speak of words."

It's just those losers and winners in some ultimate game
And there's no point playing if you're not gonna win
'Cause winning's a sacrament and losing's a sin

And I'm feeling so tired
And I'm wasted and wired
And I've got the American blues
And the mountains' majesty and the fruited plain
They're all just waving goodbye like amber fields of grain
Profit and loss is the line in the sand
A dog under the table
Teeth firmly sunk in hand
Between a rock and a hard place
Well there's nothing to choose
And I'm feeling so tired
And I'm wasted and wired
And I've got the American blues
We're as different from them as day and night
It's as plain as the nose on your face
And we run in the shadow of the power and the might
Of them that's running the human race
They rule their own, keep them close to the bone
In an isolation of fear
Under the heel, while they make the deals
The false prophets and profiteers
'Cause the world's a sound bite on the six o'clock new
And I'm feeling so tired

And I've got the American blues"

9386,"Enter GOWER
GOWER
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
Into an honest house, our story says.
She sings like one immortal, and she dances
As goddess-like to her admired lays;
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
That even her art sisters the natural roses;
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
And to her father turn our thoughts again,
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
In your supposing once more put your sight
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
Where what is done in action, more, if might,
Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
Exit

SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close
pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES
within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying
beside the Tyrian vessel.

Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS

Tyrian Sailor
[To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?
he can resolve you.
O, here he is.
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?

HELICANUS
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.

Tyrian Sailor
Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.

Enter two or three Gentlemen

First Gentleman
Doth your lordship call?
HELICANUS
Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
I pray ye, greet them fairly.

The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge

Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors

Tyrian Sailor
Sir,
This is the man that can, in aught you would,
Resolve you.

LYSIMACHUS
Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!

HELICANUS
And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
And die as I would do.

LYSIMACHUS
You wish me well.
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
I made to it, to know of whence you are.
HELICANUS
First, what is your place?

LYSIMACHUS
I am the governor of this place you lie before.

HELICANUS
Sir,
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
A man who for this three months hath not spoken
To any one, nor taken sustenance
But to prorogue his grief.

LYSIMACHUS
Upon what ground is his distemperature?

HELICANUS
'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
But the main grief springs from the loss
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

LYSIMACHUS
May we not see him?

HELICANUS
You may;
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.

LYSIMACHUS
Yet let me obtain my wish.

HELICANUS
Behold him.

PERICLES discovered

This was a goodly person,
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
Drove him to this.

LYSIMACHUS
Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
Hail, royal sir!

HELICANUS
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.

First Lord
Sir,
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
Would win some words of him.

LYSIMACHUS
'Tis well bethought.
She questionless with her sweet harmony
And other chosen attractions, would allure,
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
Which now are midway stopp'd:
She is all happy as the fairest of all,
And, with her fellow maids is now upon
The leafy shelter that abuts against
The island's side.

Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS

HELICANUS
Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
That for our gold we may provision have,
Wherein we are not destitute for want,
But weary for the staleness.

LYSIMACHUS
O, sir, a courtesy
Which if we should deny, the most just gods
For every graff would send a caterpillar,
And so afflict our province. Yet once more
Let me entreat to know at large the cause
Of your king's sorrow.

HELICANUS
Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
But, see, I am prevented.

Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady

LYSIMACHUS
O, here is
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
Is't not a goodly presence?

HELICANUS
She's a gallant lady.

LYSIMACHUS
She's such a one, that, were I well assured
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
As thy desires can wish.

MARINA
Sir, I will use
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
That none but I and my companion maid
Be suffer'd to come near him.

LYSIMACHUS
Come, let us leave her;
And the gods make her prosperous!

MARINA sings

LYSIMACHUS
Mark'd he your music?

MARINA
No, nor look'd on us.

LYSIMACHUS
See, she will speak to him.

MARINA
Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.

PERICLES
Hum, ha!

MARINA
I am a maid,
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
My derivation was from ancestors
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
But time hath rooted out my parentage,
And to the world and awkward casualties
Bound me in servitude.

Aside

I will desist;
But there is something glows upon my cheek,
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'

PERICLES
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?

MARINA
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
You would not do me violence.

PERICLES
I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
You are like something that--What country-woman?
Here of these shores?

MARINA
No, nor of any shores:
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
No other than I appear.

PERICLES
I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?

MARINA
Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
You may discern the place.

PERICLES
Where were you bred?
And how achieved you these endowments, which
You make more rich to owe?

MARINA
If I should tell my history, it would seem
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.

PERICLES
Prithee, speak:
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
believe thee,
And make my senses credit thy relation
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
From good descending?

MARINA
So indeed I did.

PERICLES
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
If both were open'd.

MARINA
Some such thing
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
Did warrant me was likely.

PERICLES
Tell thy story;
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.

MARINA
My name is Marina.

PERICLES
O, I am mock'd,
And thou by some incensed god sent hither
To make the world to laugh at me.

MARINA
Patience, good sir,
Or here I'll cease.

PERICLES
Nay, I'll be patient.
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
To call thyself Marina.

MARINA
The name
Was given me by one that had some power,
My father, and a king.

PERICLES
How! a king's daughter?
And call'd Marina?

MARINA
You said you would believe me;
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
I will end here.

PERICLES
But are you flesh and blood?
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
And wherefore call'd Marina?

MARINA
Call'd Marina
For I was born at sea.

PERICLES
At sea! what mother?

MARINA
My mother was the daughter of a king;
Who died the minute I was born,
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
Deliver'd weeping.

PERICLES
O, stop there a little!

Aside

This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
And never interrupt you.

MARINA
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.

PERICLES
I will believe you by the syllable
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?

MARINA
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
It may be,
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
I am the daughter to King Pericles,
If good King Pericles be.

PERICLES
Ho, Helicanus!

HELICANUS
Calls my lord?

PERICLES
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
What this maid is, or what is like to be,
That thus hath made me weep?

HELICANUS
I know not; but
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
Speaks nobly of her.

LYSIMACHUS
She would never tell
Her parentage; being demanded that,
She would sit still and weep.

PERICLES
O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
Though doubts did ever sleep.

MARINA
First, sir, I pray,
What is your title?

PERICLES
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
Thou hast been godlike perfect,
The heir of kingdoms and another like
To Pericles thy father.

MARINA
Is it no more to be your daughter than
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
Thaisa was my mother, who did end
The minute I began.

PERICLES
Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
She is thy very princess. Who is this?

HELICANUS
Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
Did come to see you.

PERICLES
I embrace you.
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?

HELICANUS
My lord, I hear none.

PERICLES
None!
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.

LYSIMACHUS
It is not good to cross him; give him way.

PERICLES
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?

LYSIMACHUS
My lord, I hear.

Music

PERICLES
Most heavenly music!
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.

Sleeps

LYSIMACHUS
A pillow for his head:
So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
If this but answer to my just belief,
I'll well remember you.

Exeunt all but PERICLES

DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision

DIANA
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
There, when my maiden priests are met together,
Before the people all,
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
And give them repetition to the life.
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
Awake, and tell thy dream.

Disappears

PERICLES
Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
I will obey thee. Helicanus!

Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA

HELICANUS
Sir?

PERICLES
My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
For other service first: toward Ephesus
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.

To LYSIMACHUS

Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
And give you gold for such provision
As our intents will need?

LYSIMACHUS
Sir,
With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
I have another suit.

Who died and made you king, your kingdom's coming down
You don't walk the way you used to do

You don't act like
Kings are strong, queens they long for
Kings are strong, queens they long for the kingdom

And blow your kingdom down
'Cause you don't strut the way you're supposed to
You don't reign like
Kings are strong, queens they long for
Kings are strong, queens they long for the kingdom"

Endlessly through a thousand eyes
I wanna hear you say you miss me
Only when you kiss me
I wanna feel you close to me
Once again but only in my dreams
Visions running through my mind
I know it'll happen once in my life

And it’s such a mystery

Now i'm here alone again
Thinking about my dreamland
Endlessly waiting for the day
That i can be in the pictures

In the pictures

Angels singing in the night
Sending love through the moonlight
And they kiss you on the head
Leaving red roses by your bed
In the deck i'd be the fool
Envying the lovers
Sun star moon
Color visions in my mind
I wanna feel the art once in my life
Feel it once in my life

No i’m here alone again
Thinking about my dreamland
Endlessly waiting for the day
That i can be in the pictures

Now you see me
Rivers falling from my mouth
You talk too much
Just listen to the waves

Now i'm here alone again
Thinking about my dreamland
Endlessly waiting for the day
That i can be in the pictures"
8587,"I was a log in the waves
Last time you saw me
End over end I was thrown
I endlessly groaned
""Hold my hand, won't someone come surf me?""
And of course no one came

You stood and watched the wash of water
Wedge me hopelessly into the sea wall
And there I stayed and quickly decayed
Then we all swapped molecules

Now with the wave of my hand
I command you to see me
I'm more like a mountain this time
Unmoving alpine decked in fog
I'm concealed in snow clouds

You're the farmer below
And if you've seen my face once
Then through twelve cloudy months
You will know I am there behind curtains
You'll know mountain light
Through thickness of night
See me"

At this party, they say I’m the man of the hour
You guys look more excited than me but don’t you leave me early
Oh I hate being alone and of course, I hate being loud also
Y’all gonna have a good time without me but don’t forget to call mе before you leavе
I’m full of doubts at every moment
When I put my ear on the door because I couldn’t stand a moment
Why would you talk about my future without me?
Chit-chat, why would you tryna understand my past?

You and your holy halo started burning eventually just froze
Sewn into the carpet just trying to thaw out whatever I know
The thermostat it won't go higher not that you or I know

I was drinking heavily
I burst into your bedroom belligerently
Asked her if she's done a thing like stepping out and making a scene
So foolishly I was apathetic so I blamed your family and never mended it

Shitty brakes and balding tires we're out around on the road
You and my little sister, flashy frequent scariest snow
And we return just fine
I started to crack your analytical code
By the time you're convinced, I know

When I was drinking heavily
I burst into your bedroom confusingly
Yelled about a bunch of things
That if you looked you'd never see for our eternities
And I blamed you for not being
Someone you could not be, someone you'll never be
Now I see everything and everyone you see
Killing time alone inside a stripped and nakedest home
Couldn't catch my brain up with the sights and fear that I saw
Fell into the doorway just hoping you had left the guitars
It's way too late for calling anyways I guess I'll doze off

It's way too late for calling anyways I guess I'll doze off
It's way too late for calling anyways I guess I'll doze off
It's way too late for calling anyways I guess I'll doze off
It's way too late for calling anyways I guess I'll doze off

I've been drinking carefully
I creep into our bedroom and watch you sleep

As if there's something worse, to have weaned away your worth, when I was so absurd
Well is there something worse?"

Cause they too soft to hear the truth

I dissed alex poet, or should i call him a fake

Now i got another sucker that i gotta stake

Mrs anarchy, i should slap yo face, like i did with the poet with no delay

You can scream fight and yell but you won't win today

Your lovelife is a wreck, and wishing for the worse

I hope you two break up, and i hopе you two dont work

Wishin the worse for your friends and family no wondеr your life is as bad as it can be
Off your meds more like of your psychedelics, your twitching and flinching, likw somethings tryin to get ys

Oh no now your scared fear fear fear, you have social anxiety and a fear of talkin to ya peers

Now your hiding cause your anxiety is at its peak, breath breath that's whats everyone is sayin
Your scared of your own mind know wonder why your so anxious

Yo you say all this stuff claiming your life is bad, but all i hear is nag nag nag

You see i really don't care and i never will your stories match up with the poet
Yall steal each others work you copy cat and you know it

You ain't a ghost you just ain't a interesting person people dont like you causd you so annoying

People see you in disgust when they walk by they know what youve been up to so dont try to lie

As you see i really dont care no not a little bit

Because i just dissed you and your friend alex poet

Yo poet poet poet i ain't finished, you thought i was done but im just beginning

You call yourself a poet but your drunk drinkin moet

I really dont care no not a little bit so you better step of before you get some more of this"

Reason with the clouds
Hope they pass you by again

I don’t know what you need
But I’ll try my best to be
Like a movie, you watch to hide away
With everything you hate
I think you’re doing great
And I want to be there all along the way

I got a message for myself
And don't you know I got a different point of view
Diving in the deep blue sky
See, I found myself sittin' there when I was getting high

[Chorus]
I'm on a permanent vacation to the soul
And I don't feel like workin' my
Fingers to the bone
And I fly like the bird
Above all of the bullshit
And I'm looking down on myself
To start all of the good shit
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way
And I know, I know, I know it's coming my way
[Instrumental Outro]"
1298,"[Verse]
You're special to me
Don't know what I would do without you
You're everything to me
I feel alive when you are with me
You're all that I need
The only time that I've felt this way
Lost in my mind, I swear
Thoughts only clear when they're about you
Days go by and nothing compares
To how I feel when I am with you

[Chorus]
Cloudy skies and soothing winds are what carries me
Through the days
When you're not here
The thoughts control me
(x4)

[Interlude]
When you're not here
The thoughts control me

[Chorus]
Cloudy skies and soothing winds are what carriеs me
Through the days
When you'rе not here
The thoughts control me

We came from the far north
Summered in Crimea
Deserted the armed forces
Had to disappear
Made it to the free West
On a chartered flight
So we could se what
We trained to fight

[Chorus]
We were in London
""Let's do it - let's break the law!""
We were in London
Tell it like it is
We were in London
Tell it like it is

[Verse 2]
Looking for hard work
Or credit card fraud
What do you expect from us?
We come from abroad
To get ourselves a new job
On a building-site
They work you so hard
But we trained to fight
[Chorus]
We were in London
""Let's do it - let's break the law!""
We were in London
Tell it like it is
We were in London
""Let's do it - let's break the law!""
We were in London

My father fought in Afghanistan
His widow's pension ain't worth a damn
My mother works and goes home to cry
I want to live before I die

We were in London

You took shik we talked about it and both cried
A month later I witness my nigga volt die
Fuck niggas feelings this situation is Northside
Got so much love for my brothers I’m playing both sides
I'm still mad we let them get in the way
Said somethings behind ya back i should've said in your face
Shit that we did those pussy niggas couldn't relate
You the one who taught me how to cut crack on a plate, remember?
For some reason you know how to make the hood change
Even had me selling yellow for them new jays
Few ways you was responsible for these goon ways
Fuck grades was tryna Find ways to get the crew paid
To the fakes though I love you for that
If you was a person, Shit I'd probably hug you for that
Got hit in the head didn't tell me you was coming with that
And shots at the opps you knew we wasn't fumbling that
Shit, if I don't make it did the best I could, tryin to talk to you the best I could
Can’t fault me for that
Over bitches wasn’t wrong for that
Held straps thank god they never caught me for that
Shit my Mother said you wasn't right for me
Couple times you looked out for me
That’s why I ain't mad at you
Can't be Mad at you
My mother said you wasn't right for me
Couple times you looked out for me

To waste running 'round in the city
But here on the sand I can dream away

There's nothing easier I can do
Than lyin' around doing nothing
It's a turn down day, just a turn 'round day
It's a turn down day and I dig it
Soft summer breeze and the surf rolls in
To laughter of small children playin'
Someone's radio has the news tuned in
But nobody cares what he's sayin'
Don't you know
It's a turn down day, nothin' on my mind
It's a turn down day and I dig it
Things that are waitin' to mess my mind
Will just have to wait 'til tomorrow

Ain't nowhere to go when, it's trouble on the prowl
Move for the sake of not standing still
Who's gonna save us? I guess if God can he will
Taught me to pray but, never trained me to swim
Beast of the nature; leverage can't keep him in
Float with the hopeful, 'til it starts sinkin' in
Maybe we were chosen, to lead the saints in the march in

Every indication tellin' me
We beheld the face of the devil the
Ancient letters have been and spelled it out
On the vellum, this hell is heavenly
In the inundation a revelry
Let the wave of grace envelope me
Well of emancipation, seldom I've felt as selfish
No help I fell out of zealotry
All the messages heeded 'em
Freely left the rest to be with them
My level of obedience is seen in the seasons
Freeze within the reaches of freedom
See the incredulous seekin' him
Speakin' the ineffable, kneelin'
Every seed in the legion cede allegiance
In the final breaths of death they're breathin'
Hush, I ain't never told you to trust in
Nothin' other than
What you can hold, clutch – that's just
Dust under the muslin

Then I rose, lips sealed eyes closed
Stripped these soaked clothes
Every stitch goes, I'mma be revealed
I'mma see the real get exposed
In the wind a wish blows
What kind of men are content to live with those?
I dig rows of holes for seeds
Who I'mma feed with fishes and loaves?
I am perfectly merciless
Versus the purposeless murderous
I am worthy, not worthless – I deserve this
I am worthy, not worthless – I deserve this
Je suis passé avec Dieu
Je suis passé avec Dieu"

Gonna take you somewhere
Leave it all behind
We'll go into the stars

Forget time
In an infinite universe
I know you feel alive
Let it take you away

What dreams are made of
They say
As it's above, so it's below
Ever we seek the hand
That made us
They say everything's
Broken down to dust"

Hey mister
Do you got the time?
See I do too I just wanna make sure I'm
Not going backwards so why don't you listen to my track words
You just might play it in reverse
You don't need no chorus or effects
Or distortion pedal to connect
Its just me going over the edge
Say my name
Say it before I'm  dead

Oh yo yo
Yo yo yo yo
Ughhh
Yo

[Verse 1]
I ain't got 20/20 vision
I ordered new glasses so I could be dissing
And showing my dripping
And maybe you know me and maybe you don't
Either way let my flows carry you like a boat
When me and the homies gloat
About experiences over the summer
My interior discover new kinds of feelings
Who were buried
Uncovered by
Who what when where?
Who cares

Other day I found my Care Bear from when I was younger
And my younger brother
Having a birthday
I remember that age
Every day it's either some crumbs spilt or some Legos built
With my dude
Know that I'm there for you
Just a single message to a single person
When he's older he gon' know what better what's around him
He gon' know that this verse is about him

My flows they be going
And I keep on showing emotions to women I don't even know
And they love me for it
Feel exclusive suppose
And I had something wanted but now its disposed
And I dropped her quicker than she dropped her top
Now my photos be needing a brand new crop
And this crap right now it feel like all I got
JK got the homies and honeys and doobies and sissies
We living the highest life
More than a mile high no matter who what where when
I'm still going and going
And writing and skating
Not biking my bike broke 'bout two years ago
And I can't seem to fix it
Oh well I suppose
Still playing shows
Masks and social distance are required though
(Unnecessary yo)

Yo oh yo
Yo yo yo
Let me
Let me

[Verse 2]
Let me speak my mind
Before the weather hits
Its one more thing you cannot count on
But I'm counting on the time
I need to stop looking at the clock
It distracts from what's in front of my eyes
I might die you never know
I might fly
Never know
Just wait till September 16th
The date coming mark your calendars
I'm breaking up the balance of
The Rap game
Try to bring something new to the table
I'm calling it
Four-five years I'll be shining like a comet
This shining gonna blind you
No Stanley Hotel
Only two hours away and I bet you can tell
There's screws loose
I'm delusion-al-lude from what I'm losing
Or been had lost it's no fooling

Prove me wrong prove me wrong
I bet you can't
Bet your girl know my song
And she know that I can
Be more than what I ever was before
Lay bars on the floor like a cell block C door

A nickname Tre or T or perhaps Tmac
If that name ain't used behind my back
For other rappers
Pretty common suppose
But pops called me that so I wear it before
And now and in the future
My mom named me T saying
""It will suit ya""

I guess I'ma give it some time and develop my rhymes
So I know just what I'm here for
Close the door
I'm opening a new one
Next week from now move on
The sky is no longer blue"

And I miss you babe
In the darkness here all by myself

Again, I would spend them with you

But there never seems to be enough time
To do the things you want to do, once you find them
I've looked around enough to know
That you're the one I want to go through time with

If I had a box just for wishes
And dreams that had never come true
The box would be empty, except for the memory of how
They were answered by you

Had it send shivers down your spine
Had to stop yourself from crying

You looked like you were sleeping
When they wheeled you in
I touched your face and it was so cold where my hands would feel your skin
Your hands still rough cos you worked so hard
Learnt that from you, never hurt no heart
No pain in your face just peace
Don't worry about Mum, Dad I've got this you can sleep
21 grams.. that's how much they say your soul weighs
I wish you could've seen old age
But I thank God that you didn't feel no pain

I don't have to sell my Cadillac that I just paid for

They say they got plenty but they ain't gonna part for no more

My friend says the trouble is this country's too goddamn big
Maybe we should pull it in from the edges a bit
Maybe that way we'll have so far to go
I called Mr. Getty, I even called up Texaco, Texaco

They got plenty left, they got plenty to go

And smoke it till we bleed

And in those days she had grown men kneeling at her feet
She took to an old profession as the source of revenue
Now all she's taking with her is a dress from Saks Fifth Avenue

Life and good pussy two things I get lost in
All my hoes look forward to the D like playing offense
Big faces stack them to a perfect height
Bitches only attracted to a certain type
Man Im urging these labels to get their money straight
Cuz in my particular case im worth the hype
I never lose so how you plan to get a dub off me?
I buy my haters drink the only way they'll get a buzz of me
Getting money and its tax free
My whole team balling we ain't athletes

I can't complain tho shit is on the up and up
Yup but as far as all the rest goes
I can't even call it like I ain't got on my ref clothes
Get money kill rappers blazay blazay
Basically go hard so I can shit on all my ex hoes
The fliest whips get test drove
If I like the shit then I'mma buy the shit
All I rock is designer shit

This is not just a hip-hop gig
It's club, it's pop, it's big, you dig?
No small-time, no small rhyme
I won't fall at all, cause I'm
Supported, nothin is extorted
I know you can hear it but can you afford it?
I bet you caught it, stole it, hold it
Don't you know the law detest such acts?
First you purchase, then pay tax
Not take take free and step
Jail is where your kind is kept
It's like a party, know what I mean?
As a matter of fact call it the club scene

(Dance, I know you got the feeling
I know you got the feeling
Let's dance)
[Special Ed]
I'm Special Ed, this is Kazaam
This is not just a hip-hop jam
We came like a spark to ignite
Explode into a mode like dynamite
Head-on, full blast
Thread on and I'ma get on your ass
Then let you go
And give it to Kazaam, yo

[Kazaam]
I'm Kazaam, and I'm next
Ed gave the tag, here's the suplex
Here's the pin - we win
Do i have to get physical when we're in
A battle, it's supposed to be pleasant
Not the annihilation of a peasant
I'm a lady, know what I mean?
Don't get fed Ed, this is the club scene

Get ill

Yo Ed, just groove it
And nothin movin
Nothin to be proven
Can't nobody take what's yours
[Special Ed]
Yeah, I know cause I'ma break some jaws
And bones ,forget sticks and stones
Don't take no shorts, don't give no loans
Well anyway, how much does a penny weigh?
Take your cheap thought, you don't get any say
So shove it
Yo Kazaam, do you like it?
[Kazaam]
I love it, I adore it
Hit it, I'm with it, I'm all for it
All against, commence to get overthrown
I'm on the microphone
Therefore, near or afar
When I do a show leave the door ajar
Cause the heat I generate boils water
I can burn any rhyme you ever thought of
No sweat, no Keith
No joke, no smile, no teeth
Yo Ed, tell em what I mean
[Special Ed]
Grow up boy, this is the club scene
[Kazaam]
Check it out
Take the record out
Put it on the wheels
Tell me how it feels
What is the texture, is it soft or hard?
If it's soft take it off, then throw it in the yard
Let a crackhead sell it
If it's hard memorize it and spell it
Every last sentence
Attend every show I take your attendance
But don't cut out
Because you might fail and your mother might shout
And scream and get real mean
And go (go) no more of that club scene!

[Verse1]
There’s a heavy glow that lives in me
That most will never know, feel or see
For I have built a home where only I can breathe
But the taste of your poison still lives in my dreams
But how much more of the back and forth
Do we really gotta go through to get back to truth
Because I hear everything that you say but it doesn’t make sense
Now I don’t even know you
And I’m screaming to myself in hopes you’ll hear it
But the more it echoes back, it’s just killing my spirit
How many more restless nights
Will I have to endure through life
Until I find myself in a place of comfort and I’m doing alright
I love you, I hate you, you’re a gift and a threat
I would ask you to stay but there’s no vacancies left
And there’s no vacancies left

[Chorus]
If I’m not looking for love then don’t be knocking at my door
Because I really don’t have room for you here anymore
So fuck your daydreams and the nightmares you cause
See I used to live sober, now I’m drinking a lot
And it’s all in hopes that I’ll make these memories stop
But the only thing that I found was my need to be lost
[Verse 2]
(Can we pretend)
Can we pretend that you were totally honest
(Can we pretend)
Can we pretend that you never broke our promise
(Can we pretend)
Can we pretend that you actually give a shit
Or maybe just acknowledge the fact that I still exist
‘Cuz yeah I see you staring at me with that devilish grin
Oh I know you said you sleeping but you really with him
And now you mad because all your friends, they all so in love
But bitch I gave you all I had and still wasn’t enough
But here’s the thing I don’t want another round in the ring
Not with you, not with them, see I don’t really need anything
I learn to love the one that I was alone with
And ever since I did, my mind’s been flowing
With continuous ammunition of the baggage that I’m holding
And I learn to let it go through a tribe that’s golden
And that’s all that I got
If you think I’m bullshitting well I’m probably not
Because I’m so sick and tired of only hurting myself
Thinking something will change but knowing it never will
And there’s no vacancies left

[Chorus]
If I’m not looking for love then don’t be knocking at my door
Because I really don’t have room for you here anymore
So fuck your daydreams and the nightmares you cause
See I used to live sober, now I’m drinking a lot
And it’s all in hopes that I’ll make these memories stop
But the only thing that I found was my need to be lost

The only thing I found was my need to be lost
Said the only thing I found was my need to be lost
Yeah the only thing I found was my need to be lost
Was my need to be lost, was my need to be lost
Now rise up (rise up), march up out of the dark
Let them know you ain't the one to go and tear up your heart
And if your flame burns out before the end of the night
Let’s ride (let’s ride), until we find that light
Now rise up (rise up), march up out of the dark
Let them know you ain't the one to go and tear up your heart
And if your flame burns out before the end of the night
Let’s ride (let’s ride), until we find that light

Lost diversions in the road
And far off islands in the sea
A house of flowers
A chapter and a verse
A sheet of white where we all shared our dreams

Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul

And the ring has found a bell
To tell the world we're not alone
From the silent sky a plane arrives
I feel like I've been waiting all my life
To welcome you back home

There's a wave coming in to break
The tension as we crash upon the beach
Up ahead a blanket full of stars
A pencil sketch to lie down underneath

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul

And we turn every revolution
Every revolution bringing us symphonies
Take a breath and count our lucky days
Hold me here with every revolution
Pulling together now
There's a brand new life in my soul"

Now im up looking for God

Lost within the moment
Tryna make it till the morning
I've been drinking cause I'm mourning
My neck klinking hear me coming
That's a warning
My hearts melting
Blame it on that global warming
Issa vibe got me singing like chilombo
In the skies man I'm flying like I'm dumbo
What's your sign? Dont be mad cause I dunno
Dollar signs in my eyes man that's so wrong
Mandela in my hand but i got no freedom
Need a seat at the table
Play solange when I get home
Making love playing redbone
Feeling smooth with the silk on
Looking good with the noose on
Pulling through in a Nissan
Smelling good that's ma lotion
Never good with emotion
Verse:
(Tripp Campbell)

I just sip on the potion
Plenty drive like a chauffeur
But you know cause, cause I’ve already told ya
Man I flow like the ocean
Take a trip to coast yah
So I could smoke some poison
Smoke some drink some pop one
Knock it out like a home run
Run it back like a touchdown
I’m On point like Nixon
Like I ball for the lakers
Intune with the vapors
She want D come get some
Break it down like erosion
Iced out I’m frozen


Hook

Grey skies, red wine , take time 
Smoke some, feel fine, don't stop"

Diamonds off the ground, no
They are not on the ground

Come on, get some diamonds
Axie let's find diamonds
Charlie let's find diamonds
Hi guys, let's go find diamonds
Hi guys, let's go find diamonds

Where is this life taking me

Loosing my will to fight
I am running out of breath
Nothing left for me
I've lost all control

I can't stand it anymore
No one even seems to care
Why am i even here
In this blackened night sky

My life lacks direction
No path no control
How did i end up this way
How did it
Come to be
My life fades away
Release me
From this hell
From this blackened night sky

Im taking my life back

Oh Yeah
Oh yeah yeah

Wonder how you deal with damage
From all the emotions you couldn't manage
From all of the trauma you couldn't heal from
Mental blocks you couldn't deal from
All of the walls you couldn't knock down
Ashamed of the thoughts you would jot down
I take offences and shots now
I get defensive and I lock down
Some nights I cry myself to sleep
That's the only I can sleep
Wake up then plan a new release
Winning but the game got me beat
The land suffer when you mislead the sheep
I knew you couldn't throw, but you let me run deep
Silly me

[Hook]
I hope you heal from
All the emotions that you bury
All of the babies you miscarried
All of the pain you couldn't face
Pictures you painted can't be erased
Broken hearts can't be replaced
Look at what you made out mistakes
Grateful don't mean you doing great
Lost yourself but you never lost faith (Yeah)
Let the song play
Asking you to move, like I ain't in my own way
Asking you to move, like you the reason that I'm stuck
Held the n***a down, you the reason that I'm up
Look at all these water in my cup
It still ain't enough
I'm thirsty
Price don't determine if you worthy
I would act a cower till you hurt me
Value don't determine if you worthy (Hmm)
Are you worthy, I think you worthy

If I can give anything to you
I'll put a string on the moon
I put a rope on the sun
Here's a little gift from your son
If I can give anything to you
I'll put a house on the hill
I'd fill your bank up with bills
Gonna take a break you could chill
If I can give anything to you (aye)
I give anything for you (aye)
If I can give anything to you
I'd give everything to you (aye)

[Hook]
I hope you heal from
All the emotions that you bury
All of the babies you miscarried
All of the pain you couldn't face
Pictures you painted can't be erased (Hmm)
Broken hearts can't be replaced
Look at what you made out mistakes
Grateful don't mean you doing great
Lost yourself but you never lost faith (lost faith)"

I'm 17 working on my second tape
The competition stroking my ego, its got me feeling great
Cause all of yo shit, o shit
Nobody really noticed
Cause just like a fight with Sharkiesha you got no hits
I should loan y'all bums a verse or two
I'm so versatile I could make yo style cool
My demeanor make you jealous
They in love with the kid, I'm like my generations Elvis
I got all the attention, I'm a little bit selfish
They say that I'm arrogant but I really can't help it (I can't help it)
You would be too, if you been the man since you was two
And every time the women talking talking the topic is always you
(In a high pitched voice)
Oh my God, did you see Patches today? He's so cute
I know girl and all of his raps are so smooth
(Back in normal pitch)
These bitches love Patches, they recite all my raps
The lights hit on young Patch and its like Jodeci back
Man wassup?

But that’s… that’s where all this.. that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… you know? I mean like

Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through everything..

Pause that, shooting guard, I'm trying to ball Jordan

I had to throw the rays on to get my mind focused
If beauty in the eye of the beholder then the green I'm holding
And I ain't going nowhere while that cement pouring
Put my name in the game while they love you like Raymond
Cause niggas get quick and I ain't talking bout Damon
Pacing, patiently waiting
Make your moves quick, black bottles of that ace and
Greedy paper cuts, I'm mowing on acres
Too high up, top floor elevation
Still hogg shit, RIP Aviation
Bitches catch feelings and I'm gone like a magic trick (poof)
Purple haze in the swishers, that's a magic stick
Pour up magic wine
Stop pump faking, D Wade wanna-bes
Chill bitch hit the trees

2668,"I was drifting
Into dreaming
And I saw something
I hadn't seen before

Two young ladies
I hadn't seen since high school
Holding a piece of me
Inside a plastic jar

And there was a hook attached to it
And they were attached at the hip

I was driving
On vacation
And I saw something
I hadn't seen in years

A man was seizing
On the pavement flailing
And I did nothing
A white dressed woman carried him off
I didn't lift a finger
I didn't stop my car
I just kept on driving
I didn't help that man at all

And I hope he forgives me"

Happiness to me is an ocean tide
Or a sunset fading on a mountain side
Or maybe a big old heaven full of stars up above
When I'm in the arms of the one I love

Happiness is a field of grain
Lifting its face to the falling rain
I can see it in the sunshine
I breathe it in the rain, happiness everywhere
Happiness, happiness
The greatest gift that I posses
I thank the Lord, I've been blessed
With more than my share of happiness

A wise old man told me one time
That happiness is nothing but a frame of mind
I hope when you go to measuring my success
That you don't count my money, count my happiness

Humming a secret canzonetta.
Night beds and lulls us breast to breast
Upon the isle of Margaretta.

Out here where once a cloister stood
Haven to pale and silent nuns,
Where now a love-secluding wood
Grows pagan over ruined stones,

The night incenses us with mint,
Mallow, narcissus and the wind,
Anoints us with a sacrament
Of love: a kiss we cannot end.

What jubilee the reveling crickets
Chirrup in one frenetic drone!
Deep in the grass the glow-worms flicker
Discreetly for themselves alone.

Like a gigantic tinsel veil
Round us lies the celestial arc,
And slowly the Isle of Margaretta
Sets sail with us: a bridal barque."
871,"Abu Hassan Al-Ziyadi And The Khorasan.


Quoth Abú Hassán al-Ziyádi[FN#417]: ""I was once in straitened case and so needy that the grocer, the baker and other tradesmen dunned and importuned me; and my misery became extreme, for I knew of no resource nor what to do. Things being on this wise there came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me, 'At the door is a pilgrim wight, who seeketh admission to thee.' Quoth I, 'Admit him.' So he came in and behold, he was a Khorasání. We exchanged salutations and he said to me, 'Tell me, art thou Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?'; and I replied, 'Yes, what is thy wish?' Quoth he, 'I am a stranger and am minded to make the pilgrimage; but I have with me a great sum of money, which is burdensome to bear: so I wish to deposit these ten thousand dirhams with thee whilst I make my pilgrimage and return. If the caravan march back and thou see me not, then know that I am dead, in which case the money is a gift from me to thee; but if I come back, it shall be mine.' I answered, 'Be it as thou wilt, an thus please Allah Almighty.' So he brought out a leather bag and I said to the servant, 'Fetch the scales;' and when he brought them the man weighed out the money and handed it to me, after which he went his way. Then I called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Three Hundred and Fiftieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi: ""I called the purveyors and paid them my liabilities and spent freely and amply, saying to myself, 'By the time he returns, Allah will have relieved me with one or other of the bounties He hath by Him.' However, on the very next day, the servant came in to me and said, 'Thy friend the Khorasan man is at the door.' 'Admit him,' answered I. So he came in and said to me, 'I had purposed to make the pilgrimage; but news hath reached me of the decease of my father, and I have resolved to return; so give me the monies I deposited with thee yesterday.' When I heard this, I was troubled and perplexed beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wotted not what reply to make him; for, if I denied it, he would put me on my oath, and I should be disgraced in the world to come; whilst, if I told him that I had spent the money, he would make an outcry and dishonour me before men. So I said to him, 'Allah give thee health! This my house is no stronghold nor site of safe custody for this money. When I received thy leather bag, I sent it to one with whom it now is; so do thou return to us to-morrow and take thy money, Inshallah!'[FN#418] So he went away and I passed the night in great concern, because of his return to me; sleep visited me not nor could I close my eyes; so I rose and bade the boy saddle me the she-mule. Answered he, 'O my lord, it is yet but the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to rest.' I returned to my bed, but sleep was forbidden to me and I ceased not to awaken the boy, and he to put me off, till break of day, when he saddled me the mule, and I mounted and rode out, not knowing whither to go. I threw the reins on the mule's shoulders and gave myself up to regrets and melancholy thoughts, whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of Baghdad. Presently, as I went along, behold, I saw a number of people approaching me and turned aside into another path to avoid them; but seeing that I wore a turband in preacher-fashion,[FN#419] they followed me and hastening up to me, said, 'Knowest thou the lodging of Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?' 'I am he,' answered I; and they rejoined, 'Obey the summons of the Commander of the Faithful.' Then they carried me before Al-Maamun, who said to me, 'Who art thou?' Quoth I, 'An associate of the Kazi Abu Yúsuf and a doctor of the law and traditions.' Asked the Caliph, 'By what surname art thou known?'[FN#420] and I answered, 'Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi;' whereupon quoth he, 'Expound to me thy case.' So I recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me, 'Out on thee! The Apostle of Allah (whom Allah bless and assain!) would not let me sleep this night, because of thee; for in early darkness[FN#421] he appeared to me and said, 'Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi.' Whereupon I awoke and, knowing thee not, went to sleep again; but he came to me a second time and said to me, 'Woe to thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi.' I awoke a second time, but knowing thee not I went to sleep again; and he came to me a third time and still I knew thee not and went to sleep again. Then he came to me once more and said, 'Out on thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi!' After that I dared not sleep any more, but watched the rest of the night and aroused my people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee.' Then he gave me one myriad of dirhams, saying, 'This is for the Khorasani,' and other ten thousand, saying, 'Spend freely of this and amend thy case therewith, and set thine affairs in order.' Moreover, he presented me with thirty thousand dirhams, saying, 'Furnish thyself with this, and when the Procession-day[FN#422] is being kept, come thou to me, that I may invest thee with some office.' So I went forth from him with the money and returned home, where I prayed the dawn-prayer; and behold, presently came the Khorasani, so I carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of dirhams, saying, 'Here is thy money.' Quoth he, 'It is not my very money; how cometh this?' So I told him the whole story, and he wept and said, 'By Allah, haddest thou told me the fact at first, I had not pressed thee!; and now, by Allah, I will not accept aught of this money'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the Khorasani to Al-Ziyadi, ""'By Allah, haddest thou told me the fact at first, I had not pressed thee!; and now, by Allah, I will not accept aught of this money and thou art lawfully quit of it.' So saying, he went away and I set my affairs in order and repaired on the Procession-day to Al-Maamun's Gate, where I found him seated. When he saw me present myself he called me to him and, bringing forth to me a paper from under his prayer-carpet, said to me, 'This is a patent, conferring on thee the office of Kazi of the western division of Al-Medinah, the Holy City, from the Bab al-Salám[FN#423] to the furthest limit of the township; and I appoint thee such and such monthly allowances. So fear Allah (to whom be honour and glory!) end be mindful of the solicitude of His Apostle (whom may He bless and keep!) on thine account.' Then the folk marvelled at the Caliph's words and asked me their meaning; whereupon I told them the story from beginning to end and it spread abroad amongst the people."" ""And"" (quoth he who telleth the tale) ""Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi ceased not to be Kazi of Al-Medinah, the Holy City, till he died in the days of Al-Maamun the mercy of Allah be on him!"" And among the tales men tell is one of


Footnotes:



[FN#417] A doctor of law in the reign of Al-Maamun.

[FN#418] Here the exclamation is= D.V.; and it may be assumed generally to have that sense.
[FN#419] Arab. ""Taylasán,"" a turban worn hood-fashion by the ""Khatíb"" or preacher. I have sketched it in my Pilgrimage and described it (iii. 315). Some Orientalists derive Taylasan from Atlas=satin, which is peculiarly inappropriate. The word is apparently barbarous and possibly Persian like Kalansuwah, the Dervish cap. ""Thou son of a Taylasán""=a barbarian. (De Sacy, Chrest. Arab. ii. 269.)

[FN#420] Arab. "" Kinyah"" vulg. ""Kunyat"" = patronymic or matronymic; a name beginning with ""Abu"" (father) or with ""Umm"" (mother). There are so few proper names in Al-Islam that such surnames, which, as will be seen, are of infinite variety, become necessary to distinguish individuals. Of these sobriquets I shall give specimens further on.

[FN#421] ""Whoso seeth me in his sleep, seeth me truly; for Satan cannot assume my semblance,"" said (or is said to have said) Mohammed. Hence the vision is true although it comes in early night and not before dawn. See Lane M. E., chaps. ix.

[FN#422] Arab. ""Al-Maukab ;"" the day when the pilgrims march out of the city; it is a holiday for all, high and low.

[FN#423] ""The Gate of Salutation ;"" at the South-Western corner of the Mosque where Mohammed is buried. (Pilgrimage ii. 60 and plan.) Here ""Visitation"" (Ziyárah) begins."

6931,"You'd think we live in a time of reason
Faith discourages independent thought
It's used as a crutch, or so it seems
A shallow pretense on which is leans

A divine creator of life belittles
The elegant reality of strife
The assault on the senses appeals
For them not to think, not to doubt how they feel

Chorus:
Our faith's in Man
We don't need threats of hell to know what's right
The only reason they don't steal is to please a God that isn't real
That's a warped morality

Thou shall not kill
Unless on command
Don't preach to me
'cause the blood's on your hands
The promised land
The chosen few
They know what to do
They like to say
""how do you know?""
Science won't pray
Knowledge will grow

Tossing frags of vernacular/deep in the city of lavender, accents the clothes that my master wore
Understand that this man a B.O.A.R,head high, back low, that lion roar
Life by the horns no matador riding beats what's that saddle,
Setting fire like Saboteur(damn you spazin boi pls elaborate saboteur?)
Um, EA or Hitchcock, tell ke$ha tiktok wristwatch
Young embodiment of hip hop, holding heavy metal like slipknot but ain't talking clip pop
Stop a horse on its 5th trot,(stop a horse in its 5 trot? dammit when will this shit stop?)

Last night downtown I was drinking the booze
Like it was going out of style
My whole head got light
I lost my eyesight
I haven't been that drunk in a while
Along about 1 I spotted a queen
And I started to make my move
Aw, she was believing every line I was laying
Lord I was just too cool
Well I thought I died and gone to heaven
But lord did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

[Chorus]
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
[Verse 2]
Well I made up my mind
I was never gonna find
Myself in that condition again
But here I sit on the same bar stool
And just look at the shape I'm in
I done spotted me another queen
Sitting at a table alone
So I strolled on over and sat myself down
And asked if I can take her home
When she said yes, I thought I'd been blessed
But boy did I look like a fool
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2

[Chorus]
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10
But at 10 I woke up with a 2
I've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
But lord when I do I lose
I ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
But I sure woke up with a few
Last night I came in at 2 with a 10

Love to say my name, I'm the mermaid girl
Little wet and baby, in the tundra curl

The drums are pumpin'
The groove is lockin' in the rhythm like we want it to be

No time for stallin'
We're really haulin'
We've gotta keep it in the pocket or we'll stagger behind

You never know just when to leave it when you're riffin' in time
Or if the time itself will falter, or of words even rhyme
But we admit, the trick to it is not to think about it
When you're busy bravin' all the notes in the line

This time we mean it
We're gonna swing it
And take you right up to the end before we try to unwind

I've never been the kind of guy who could just normally quit
Never could decide when to rest my pride
And feel all right with just good enough
Thoughts, they gather
Tellin' me to look to find a bright new way
To assemble all the stimulated motives that haunt me
Tryin' a live it, be in the moment, tryin' to sing it alone
Can beckon to me, a feelin' of being bent
So I believe, takin' a leave is the brightest way to stop
All the chatter boxin' going 'round in my brain
So I'm wailin' - movin' and groovin' this part of this song
I hope that my riff's good enough to keep
Better leave it now or go out of my mind
Now I dig you think that perfect's what we should make it
But I've been down that road and I can tell ya how we feel's

The most important thing about it
Whether you're right or whether you might think we're pathetic
A little lighter on the reins will help you loosen up the chains
That are still binding you -
In the past, whenever thoughts I had would try to re-evaluate all that I would do
I'd hesitate, consolidate, and motivate
All the little pearls of doubt that strive to break up every single bit of
Precious joy that flowed from God's soul spark that
Shines within me
That's it in a nut shell
So take advice from this sap, go for feel and leave it alone

Now's the time to sing
Swing is what we bring
Rhythm that's the thing
To really get your spirit movin' higher

Gonna jump and play
Dance the night away
Make you really sway
And let the music take you even higher

E-lla sang this song real special
Come on, come on - we'll sing this special song for you
One more one we'll go
But before we blow
We want you to know
The take is really good enough, we'll keep it!"

I believe in me more then anybody else
That’s why I will always my greatest investment
I’ve seen niggas with low self esteem tryin to sabotage, how I feel about myself, uh
No hard feelings, But you gotta try Better then that
I’m coming for the crown
No hard feelings, But your bars gotta be better then that -
Eyes on the prize like my last name focused
I’ve met niggas thinking they better then me
Reality check, check, check, uh
Don’t make me show you the statistics of your downfall
Because, money is the motive, Not the issue nigga
Be careful how you speaking, I don’t cover incidentals
Rapping over old instrumentals, I had in the vault
No hard feelings, I had to distance myself
Nobody cared about my emotions so my heart got cold
No hard feelings, I had to roll up my sleeves
Just to achieve these, Florida palm trees
I see jealously and tears forming in your eyes
I’ve stopped worrying about people’s opinions on me
So I could, focus on myself more
No hard feelings between you and I
That shit died when I was sophomore
I stopped praying for guidance, When I found my path way
How you expect me stop only half way  16 blessed me, so I could make good on my promises
No hard feelings, this is just how the story go"

Water lilies give me an eyeful

We all wish to be richer
Same blood same creator
Covered in the mud flooded in fud
Against all odds I get the treasure
Listen!
If you're a snitch I'll outwit you
Been rocking a scary scar
Like the Witcher
Trust is earned yet quickly lost
The tables turned but they knew the cost
Nothing new I have known a few
Now they're in my shoes while I'm in Lacoste
Grief garden teeth sharpened
I'm a 🐊 starving
Brief bargain cheap guardian
Watching juveniles snorting
The clock is ticking - making you shook
The song is catchy - apache hook
Scared to death scared to look they shook
Cause there's such a thing as Captain Hook
The stocks are dipping - making you shook
The bong is catchy - apache hook
Scared to death scared to look they shook
Cause there's such a thing as Captain Hook
Grief garden teeth hardened

No one stayed seeing how it played out

Never made it with a lady

Kept me warm when I was cold
Never left me down alone
Gave me your hand there to hold
Even when I Didn't really trust no one
But you're still my number 1
Talking all day, all night long
Told me hold on and stay strong
Got a lot of love but I feel  None
Don't take drugs but I feel numb
Hope I'll get past through this storm
It's something I'll overcome
Scared of what I will become
Light shining right in my dark
Always there you got my back
Special place right in my heart
Keeping things inside just to hide the pain
Checking up on me to see if I'm okay
Hope what we have won't fade away
I just want someone who's there to stay

Still they're tryna say that man's underrated
'Member I was young, I was chasing up payslips
Face it, the other man ain't reaching these paces
Like, like (Like), why do you think they call man Scofield?
They really should let man outta these cages
Might up it, lift it, aim it
Cah man shoot for the stars and let 'em know that we come from far
And just know when I quit this rap ting, the whole fam ain't working no job
There's no cap, man put it on God
Self-employed man bringing his work
When I bring this work, can't talk about boss (Oh my God, oh my God)

Tryna keep my head straight, looking for the path I take
You ever get that feeling in your heart that you can’t escape
Feels like I’m losing it all, I miss the better days
Baby still schooling me on love, can’t wait to graduate
Hatred in peoples veins pouring like a crap lake
Seems like nothing but fakes in my new place, wanna go gang gang
Rappers doing nun but talk about the same thang, ha

Wanna take y’all back home so they can set you straight
Not tryna judge the steps you take, but it’s not hard to tell real from fake
Input no one asked for, feel like leaving it all at stake
Wanna explode but is it worth the mess I’ll make
Keeping it real that’s all I had to say

[Hook]
This is how I get when the week ends, I’m a mess
But you still love me to my weak ends
Guard your heart, I be playing defense
You still love me when the week ends
You still love me when the week ends, when I’m feeling trapped and all the pressure increasing
You still love me when the week ends"

In a world I used to know before, yes I miss you more

Bringing the warmth of new life
And the sound that echoed all around me
That I caught a glimpse of in the night
Oh, but now, now I've lost everything

And the meaning of all that I believed before
Escapes me in this world of none, no thing and no one

Said I belong to the grab society but I got mine

Then I went off to work early one mornin'; that's somethin' that never did suit me
While a-peepin' through the crack, back in my old lady settin' on a some other man's knee
Snatched off her veil wrapped across her head, and he jumped up in cryin'
""You been fightin' your lady, doggone your soul, but I got mine""

Around here tryin' to get some'n' good t'eat all the time
Said ever since then I been livin' high; I been livin' on the chicken and wine
Said I belong to the knockdown society but I got mine

I went uptown to a little crap game, as some other police must say
That man looked at me, never cracked a smile; I couldn't get this fella to laugh
So he throwed the dice out on the floor, and the place got fightin' like nine

Warriors both of course

Broke off his horse's head
Wept for his toy then cried with joy
As his young playmate said:

""Did you think I would leave you crying
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here Jack and don't be crying
I can go just as fast with two

When we grow up we'll both be soldiers
And our horses will not be toys
And I wonder if we'll remember
When we were two little boys""

One wore the blue, the other gray
Cannon roared loud, and in the mad crowd
Wounded and dying lay
Up goes a shout, a horse dashes out
Out from the ranks so blue
Gallops away to where Joe lay

""Did you think I would leave you dying
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon be flying
I can go just as fast with two

Did you say Joe I'm all a-tremble
Perhaps it's the battle's noise
But I think it's that I remember
When we were two little boys"""

Welcome to a world of hate
We're all so glad you've come
Let us know what we might do
To keep you feeling numb

May your stay be long and bitter
Welcome to a world of hate where the greedy men in suits are controlling your fate
May your tortured soul keep bleeding
Until all you love is gone

May your stay be long and bitter
May your problems keep piling on

There are things to eat at the sideboard:
Just words, junk and pain
All the things that you can't swallow
Will, of course, be served again

Welcome to a world of hate where thе greedy men in suits are controlling your fate
Wеlcome to a world of hate where money lies and the body is all only trade
Welcome to a world of hate

If you knew what you’ve done to me

Oh you really knew how to take control

Sitting in a crossfire and pretend that nothing’s wrong
And a tune with no words is stronger than a melody

Without you in my bed

I told everyone that I never wanted this
I couldn't handle love again

I'll always stay
If you promise the same
My worst days are still ok because you're in them
You'll have to deal with me forever

Every dime I've made
Spilling my guts on stage
Is in a box under my side of the bed

Burning a hole
Through the bedroom floor
What did you think I've been saving for?

I'll always stay
If you promise the same
And my worst days are still ok because you're in them
You'll have to deal with me forever
I went to a man who knows all about these things
And before I left, I bought you this ring"

Devil Music Edition
And nah I don't worship the devil
Pretty much
This a metaphor
For music
And what the people, artists
And I see them feeding the communities
But listen to this

I got the game on smash
I brought it to the front
This is foes
This is the hood
Niggas'll never front
Word to God I never prayed to money
Asked angels above
I seen niggas shady and hungry
I kept moving
Knowing once I was a hitter
Mind controlled by TVs and niggas
The terminator is a hood-saviour
Flavor
But no flavor in love
Girls are shady like clubs
Let you in the V.I.P. with no love
Fuck a bitch
Bitch I'm getting paper
What the fuck is a label?
And why these people in labor
Working harder than slavers
Try to watching the news with no cable
A lot of dark nights involving hustling
People struggle
Put faith in the deadly dozen
Money
Destruction
Hate
Extermination
Please don't speak the fatal disease
People sleeping in peace
We at war in a place overseas
And we still lie praying to Jesus
People shoot and they bleeding
Murderers be getting hunted by demons
Ride on you with the pump and they heathens
Ride on you and squeeze it, went to sleep
He woke up and met Jesus
Pray to God I wake up when I'm sleeping
One eye for the suckers
One eye for the world believing
Third eye in the middle for weedin'
When you live in the suite
In the hood they bust on you like semen
Can't compare if no love in your heart
You gotta forgive
You gotta learn that the people are smart
You gotta have the love in your heart
I'm speaking for real
I coulda rapped about how real that I am
To tell the truth it's for the people indeed
I'm planting my seeds
Next time I'll be a legend indeed
Until then
Appreciate me

Don't let me die
And see the legend in me

Coz I know that
Describing you
Takes more than words
I’ll confirm that
Wanna let you know that you worth it
We know that
Humans ain’t perfect, but you perfect
I can’t go back
To all my exes
I deserve you
That’s my purview
You gotta trust me
I’ll treat you like the goddess
That you are
I’ m a human
In comparison to you, you’re such a star
You like a spectre, I can’t tell if you are real
It’s so surreal, when I feel your body next to mine
I’ll die having lived
I wanna be the best you ever had or have or had and having
Girl, I wanna be your happy ending when you’re faced with sadness
Damn
Just pick up the phone when I call
You say you like the tone of my voice when I talk
I love it when you laugh as I crack a bad joke
Comedy ain’t my thang, I’m a rapper, I catch flows

Stack that paper, don't let that paper-cut scar you
We coulda been All-Pro, but we was all fools
Thinkin' that that dumb shit was a smart move
And at times nigga? it seemed like that, until I took a step back
And realized I wasn't makin' no Hooves

Are We Prepared, Are We Pre-paired (x2)

Why regret the past love? Time is all we have
Why repeat the past, why repeat the past

[Verse 1]
How are we a match made in heaven when they say that it ain't one?
What if God came back what we gon' do when the day come?
Wait but what if it ain't one and it’s all made up?
What if it is and he stand so close?
That we got no choice but face him
Or face them, cause its more than one
What would you say huh and he left me and he take yah’
And I’ll be gone for a minute, but I’ll get you back when I’m finished
At church so confused cause my soul ain't in it
And they got God and they feel it all in they spirit
And they pass out and faint cause they catch the holy ghost
But I just can’t get it
No matter how much I pray I just can't get it
Yo God has a different name they ain't the same
But our love ain't different...is it?
[Bridge: Josh Mathur]
Are we prepared Yes we are pre-paired by our Gods
Are we prepared? Yes we are pre-paired by our God

[VERSE 2]
We ain't got to take a blood oath to ensure that its love here
Its better ways to do that just say fuck fear
If we a match made in heaven I hope its one up there
But we on earth lighting will only strike once here
So lets not care what they say, lets not care who they are
Cause we traveled a distance and we came too far
Lets not care what they think, or care what they thought
Lets live for today, lets hope for tomorrow
My heart, what if I ain't got Christ in it
And I don't look to him for enlightenment
That Bible verse ain't reciting them
But, I spent my life giving my whole live giving
Then this place called heaven… do I get in?
What if love and peace is only what you find in him?
But he don't know God is he frying then?
The thought of that, I just don't get it
Yo God has a different name, they ain't the same
But our love ain't different. Is it?

Rapt in the arms of a galaxy spiral
Heard a sea-shell hid it's secret as well
This nexus is key to our planets survival

One precious moment it all became clear;
Brain-cloud-haze lifted by euphoric fear
To the unknown my mind's eye directed;
Beheld every mote in creation connected

No more Hereafter, eugenics our master;
Sectarist lecture mere witless hubris
Humanity's blunder was ceasing to wonder;
Why are we here; what's the meaning of this?

Virtual church without actual sages;
Souls under scrutiny, rats in glass cages
Enigmas deciphered are no longer needed;
Lost words of warning unheard or unheeded

[Chorus:]
We're all hooked-up to the vast karmic internet;
Each of our souls on the end of it's fibre
One sacred fact that we can't download yet;
The truth is we share the same service-provider

Brain-cloud-haze lifted by euphoric fear
To the unknown my mind's eye directed;

Each of our souls on the end of it's fibre
One sacred fact that we can't download yet;

Fundamentalists freak-out as humanists scoff
A headlong collision 'twixt science and religion;
There'll be Hell to pay

The same ones who accept my help
Don't give a damn about the pain I felt unless it boost they wealth
But I'm a true solider quiet is kept
You know it's death before even if I get swept
Damn why the hood ain't made of G's
Because if it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to breathe
If it was then these cowards wouldn't be able to leave
Haters worse then a disease that's what I believe

Seems like I'm always after
Everything that doesn't matter
I can't stop it
Getting all worked up and bothered
Gotta put just one more dollar in my pocket
I search and never find it
All at once then I'm reminded
I forgot them

[Chorus]
There ain't a thing I owe
He said he'd save my soul
If I believe and I do
So what am I worried about
All that fear and doubt
That gets me down isn't true
That straight and narrow slip
Where the devil gets a grip
Makes me think he's gonna win
But I've read and [?] those words in red
And I already know how the story ends

Sometimes it feels like
The only thing that I do right
Is the wrong thing
Cast all my cares on him
Then I take 'em all back again
Go my own way
Then he [?] me back around

And I hear it say

9812,"When I was 5, I wanted to be a Star Wars character
I would bounce around the walls and use the force to control all
Yoda would visit me and I would smile at him and then we'd defeat the Sith
See, I didn't need anyone to play with because I was happy with myself
The lightsabers, imaginary wars, and pretend heroism
When I was 8, I wanted to be a soldier
So I wrote stories about great adventures fighting a war
And through my words, I soared high above burning landscapes
And kept my people safe
I mean, it didn't matter who I was fighting as long
As I was fighting because that's what a hero did
I wanted to be a hero, and I wanted to save everybody around me
When I was 11, I wanted to be a comedian
So I cracked jokes to pass the time and I wouldn't ever rhyme
And I would force my parents to listen to the same jokes over
And over, and over, and over, and over until it was told just right
God I love them because they would laugh even after the thousandth time
And I would smile and hug them as my heart grew full from the sound of their chuckles
I mean, I just wanted to make them happy
When I was 14, I wanted to be a mountain biker
I wanted to zoom past hikers, discover new worlds, and find myself
I longed for dirt paths leading to nowhere
I yearned for a concrete jungle just waiting to be explored
I wished to be isolated in nature with nothing but the trees around me
And also with all of my friends
I mean, I wanted to find myself while searching the woods for answers
So I sit and I think to myself of everything I ever wanted to be
And how no matter what how I feel that I will never be happy with, with just being me
Because now instead of wanting to be a hero
I desperately want someone to be a hero and save me from my own mind
And instead of wanting to defeat the Sith
I want to defeat the Darth Vader that lives inside the Anakin Skywalker of my mind
And to replace my want to be a soldier is a want
To end my own mental country and use bullets to do so
And instead of wanting to tell jokes and make people laugh I just want them to hear me
But they can't hear me over their laughter because I don't know how to breathe
I don't know how to sing, I wish I knew how to sing
Because maybe if it sounded pretty they would hear me
Maybe if it formed a melody they would hear my plea but they won't
Because now I want my mountain bike to crash
I don't want to explore the dirt, I want to be buried in it
I still want to find myself but I want to find it my way
I don't want them telling me, directing me, instructing me
Pulling the corners of my mouth up in a crooked smile like
I'm a puppet and they're the masters
I just want to find what I'm seeking after
Because trust me, I still want to be a hero, and I still want to get the girl
I just want to be remembered and I want to be sure
That when I throw myself off this building like Superman waiting to fly
That hopefully no one I love will shed too many tears and cry
Because I just want to be a hero
I dream to be a hero and when I don't grow up
I want to be a hero"
7845,"I traveled far, I said hello, how do you do?
You thought my mind was twisted, how you dissed it
Oh, what can I do?
And so I tried to talk my mind
Woke up with screams that came from you
You say it's hard to know me, hard to know me
Maybe all the things they said were true

My mind blows up, way up on top with things I do
You say you have to know me, must control me
Oh, what can I do?
And so I think back, go back, track back
To the words which came from you
You say it's hard to know me, hard to know me
Maybe all the things they said were true

I hope that someday now you'll see your life is hell
Because so hard to know me, hard to know me
Oh, what can I do?
And so I drop your thoughts and kill your words
In everything I do
Because you hardly know me, hardly know me
Maybe that's the story of my life"

Spineless deceit
Robbed your own joy
Waved the flag of defeat

Coward obsolete

Speak no, hear no evil
No one’s even listening
I can’t let these emotions betray me
Best not make a scene

Your skeletons take rеfuge in public displays
Blurred the linеs, until your lies spark flames
Burning down your house of mirrors and maize
Hear as the jester exclaims

Speak no, hear no evil
No one’s even listening
I can’t let these emotions betray me
Best not make a scene
Your talk is cheap
Just come clean
Narcissism's taken all control of your brain

But when I'm on the microphone it goes somethin like this

You just put it in my pocket cause you know I gotta take it

Let me see if you can hack my stuff

Russians got a thing about shooting down planes
They did it before, now they're doin it again
Can't you see that this world is comin to an end?
I wish that everyone would just go make friends
You're tellin me shit about the friendly skies
But to me it's all just a big pack of lies
Sit at your TV set, get all hypnotized
But it's about time that you realized
It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

But then [?]
You make one mistake and you're behind the brick wall
Told you sooner or later you'd take the fall
Thought you was bad 'cause you joined the gang
But let me tell you, billy boy, you've just been had
'Cause your homeboy, he didn't wanna do no time
While you do your thing, he dropped the dime
Is this something you can call a real true friend
Turn around to backstab you in the end
Now he's on the outside looking in
There's a frown on your face, a grin on him
You see, things like these happen every day
I know there is a a better way
Instead of being in the [?] with nowhere to go
Searching for your pot of gold in the end of the rainbow
It's rough, it's tough
I'm gonna see if you can hack my stuff

It's rough, it's tough

It's rough, so tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

So now you heard of the negative part
And we wanna see you make a brand new start
Let me tell exactly like my mama told me
Be a doctor, be a lawyer, get a PhD
Making your mark on this world [?]
So wise up, kids, and stay in school
So when after you learn your ABC's
You can come and rock the party with me

Well, i'm Kid Frost, and that's my name
And when i go to a party like i run my game
With the utmost ease, i tell you right now
If you got that funky feeling and you're wondering how
My rhymes are hard, and never soft
I just get on the mic and never wanna stop
I'm so full of action, the ladies' attraction
I won more awards than Michael Jackson
Breakdancers, romancers
Ain't got no time for no second chancers
And when the sucker MC's try to be like me
Let me tell you now boy, how it's gonna be
If you need some help you better call your mom
You better stick to your hat like bubble gum
'Cause the K-I-D F-R-O-S-T
Kid Frost, better known as [?]
Yeah, Kid Frost, the rappin boss
Guaranteed to make your body wanna twist and toss
Loosen up your back and then you [?]
If you ain't [?], well your woman just might

With the stars in my eyes
And the blood from the heart on my pen
With my hood pulled up
In the light of the night
I was smoke in the bed
Like a ghost white light
On the turnpike

You didn't lift my world off me
But you said to let it go
So I did, now I see
That my friends are gonna leave me
If they don't believe that they can save me

You don't have to live like that
You don't have to live like that

Like a bolt of lightning
You stop, life moves on
Then you wake up frightened
What's going on
What's going on
I'm waking up tired
No god has appeared
I never ever really
Found real faith in the fear

You don't have to live like that
You don't have to live like that

I'm so sorry for the things I said
But a lot of me died
When a part of her did

Like a dream, it's a fear
And it won't carry out
I will live an easy
Nightmare plant a seed
In your garden of doubt

You didn't lift my world off me
But you said to let it go
So I did, now I see
That my friends are gonna leave me
If they don't believe that they can save me

You don't have to live like that
You don't have to live like that
Like a bolt of lightning
You stop, life moves on
And you wake up frightened
What's going on
What's going on

I'm waking up tired
No god has appeared
And I never ever really
Found real faith in the fear

Just let me wash it all away
Let me wash it away

Found real faith in the fear

So shall the dead — So shall the dead

From all that's dwelling below the skies
Let the false heaven's praise arise
False salvation loud proclaim and shout for the joy of the false god's name
Blessed be the song of the fraud and the sham
Blessed be the foul masquerade of the lamb
Hosanna! Behold the rise of an army of well-dressed anti-Christs

And as the one torch at last shall burn
So shall the flesh — So shall the tenets of the flesh
So shall the doctne of the womb
So shall the gospel of the birth
So shall the promise of the Lord
And as the first voice in war shall drown
So shall the last — so shall the despair of the last

And as his word now shall come alive
So shall the dead — so shall the dead
For all that's dwelling below the skies
That blind destruction that in us thrives
Holy water upon the young and holy poison under the tongue
Cherish the ashes, revere the dust
Embrace the vows of the jewel wasp
Hosanna, Stolen gospelshine — Hosanna to the false divine

And as the one law at last shall fall
So shall the flesh — so shall the tenets of the flesh
So shall the doctrine of the womb
So shall the gospel of the birth
So shall the promise of the Lord
So shall the blessings of the damned
And as our psalms one last time shall roar
So shall our doom — So shall the trumpets of our doom"

Now it ain’t shit, Ladies see me and they ""purr""
My parents weren’t around much, Stuck in that nine-to-five
Saw the cold world in front of my eyes, I ain’t gon' lie!
My mind was a prison, But didn’t bother my vision
Had a hard time thinking 'bout making decisions
But I did it with precision, Kept going like a soldier
Held my ground, I’m still down on my mission
Used to skip school, Hit the studio and chill
Wish I could go back man I'ma be real
Every week 2 o’clock in front of the CD store
Young, dumb and broke but I knew the city boy!

This the truth, Wait 'til your time comes
Still, I drop jewels on this booth
Ain't no one to fit my shoe
Dedication over everything
Still, I pray hoping that I won't lose!
Listen, Momma having hard times
Trynna pay the bills, All by herself
Man we living down in hell!
But still, I prevail in this cold world
Cream high like them hills
Voices in my head, Telling better if I change
If you love yourself, It don't matter what they say

And I ain't going nowhere, So you can get to know me

[Verse 3: Junior Crysto]

Born in 1995, 19th of July
Where the land's so fine, The rest let's keep it aside
I met my dad at nine, Took a while
Now we’re living overseas to the side
Music really saved my life, Fam!
I remember asking God for one thing
All I wanted was a mic, Born ready for this fight
Even if they hate it or love it, We been ready to kill it, I kill it
This is not just a race, It’s a marathon
We still carry on, ""CMB To The World"", That’s the finish line!
Ten years in this bitch repping ""Makers-Land""
Better recognize the fucking name
Troublemakers be the fucking gang!
Yeah, Eating good, Rocking every booth
Fuck the views, I'd rather do what I love to do!
All these rappers repping weed
You really think you cool?
This that boom-bap rap, No goody-good, Aye!
[Hook: KVN, Kaos & Junior Crysto]

Hate it or love it, The underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, So you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, The underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, So you can get to know me"

Every little touch sends a rush into my veins
Your pull is like siren calling out my name, oh no
You're just like a drug, tears me up inside
Like a stupid love song I don’t want to like
I can't get enough but I hope I don't overdose tonight

You got me so drunk on your ecstasy
I'm a zombie with a beating heart
You can't see my aching dependency
Pretending to hold it together is just too hard

Don't pray to God but tonight I pray for you

I'd cheat all the dealers to chase your high
I'd lie to my friends to have you one more time
All because

The way it feels
There's seven miles to reach that road
You stumble in

When you were a child
They forced you out
Such innocent games
You used to play

You fell in the snow
Drank that water
And since that day
The cold outside
Just froze you in

If you don't want to breathe
Open your mouth
'Cause anyway
Anyway
The cold gets in
Indistinct chant

Thick white haze tames it all
You might be dead
You spot that deer
Just showing up
And disappear

If you don't want to breathe
Open your mouth
'Cause anyway
Anyway
The cold gets in

If you don't want to breathe
Shake up your mind
'Cause anyway
Anyway
The cold gets in

Hey you
Hey you
Hey you
There's something wrong if you don't feel how cold you are
There's something wrong, something wrong, something wrong
If you don't feel how cold you...

Vibin', coolin' and making on a Sunday afternoon
It's empty, I got space for you

Jeep for the summer, top goes straight down
And the sun won’t come up
'Cause we say so
This would be the perfect time to bring up being more than friends

[Chorus]
Just for the summer, wanna go undercovers with you, baby
It's you, baby

To love me, love me, don't let this thing go
Please don't wait till we're fallin' apart
Call 'fore its back to lonely hearts"

Fool that I was
A goddess, with wings on her heels
All my illusions
Projected on her
The ideal, that I wanted to see

Fool that I was
Little by little, I learned
My friends were dismayed
To see me betrayed
But they knew they could never tell me

What did I care?
Fool that I was
Little by little, I burned
Maybe sometimes
There might be a flaw
But how pretty the picture was back then

What did I do?
The fool that I was
To profit from youthful mistakes?
It's shameful to tell
How often I fell
In love with delusions again

So shameful to tell
Just how often I fell

Of a Ford Fairlane Dad gave to me
It's a love letter written down in spray paint
Screamin' ""I love Katie"" to the interstate
It's a hole in the wall behind a picture frame
A football jersey with an old grass stain
Tin cans tied to the back of a car
That's life leavin' its mark

[Chorus]
That's just life leavin' its mark
Through lifelines, tattoos, and scars
All the good and bad are colors on a canvas
One big work of art, that's life leavin' its mark

[Verse 2]
It's a baseball trophy from the big game
Still standin' at the high school in a glass case
A chewed up cushion on the family couch
An old dog collar on an old dog house
A bump on the belly, a mark on the door
Three inches taller than the year before
It's another pack of Huggies in the shoppin' cart
That's life leavin' its mark

Well, that's just life leavin' its mark
Through lifelines, tattoos, and scars
All the good and bad are colors on a canvas
One big work of art, that's life leavin' its mark

It's three generations worth of farmland
Where a brand new interstate cut in half
A mall in the middle of a corn field
They're straightenin' up country for a curb appeal
Faith could in a church be takin' down
For some brand new apartments at the edge of town
It's a sign sayin' God is in our hearts

Well, that's just life leavin' its mark
Through lifelines, tattoos, and scars
All the good and bad are colors on a canvas
One big work of art, that's life leavin' its mark

So I'll just let it go
I've lost my interest in control
I only care to fill in the hole
Left by what I wish you stole

What I took from myself
I gave it to everyone else
Spread it all around
Until my soul can't be found
Isn't this what dreams are made of?
Well, it's not what I paid for anymore, anymore

I will never be released if I'm the whore
I will never find peace in a place of war

I'm sorry that I don't wanna ride along
I'm sorry that I think something's wrong
And I forgive you for pushing me away
And I forgive you for wanting it all your way
But one thing I'm not sorry for
Is singing this song to you
Goodbye

That was our week's work with him
Dream is a manifestation of the unconscious side
So I first explained to him that the eyes in our conscious
And that the dream is a manifestation of it
And if we succeed in analysing the dream
Means we might get an idea about that power that makes him think harder
And I've never felt more alive before with a tie

Sync with this city, everywhere I'm at

Whеre you been at? It's been a minute, oh
I'm dripping water like Pacific
Four rings on me like the Olympics, I
Four rings on me like the Olympics, I (Ooh)

Fuck D, I let G not the biggest on religion
Not big on math but you know I like counting digits
Not big on math but you know I like counting digits
Not big on math but you know I like counting digits
Kick him out the circle, they speaking in corners
What's with the questions? Everybody over here is a reporter
I'm making figures that fathers make, does that make her my daughter?
She call me ""Daddy"", it's funny 'cause I wasn't born before her
Just close your eyes and think of something else
Stop tryna figure out somebody that don't know themselves
So deceptive, how did you get into my dreams?
Told her I'm gon' live forever, got it written on my sleeve

They gon' make so much of worth off of what you earning

Midnights in October
And it sings to you and only you
So how did I hear it too?
How did I hear it too?

And well I know, no please
I know it's exactly what I want
And I hate how much I love to hear you tell me
""Let me breathe a minute
Never mind, I didn't really need it""
And if we try to say what we need
We could be okay
We clearly believе in believing baby
We'll try slow
Wе'll try slow
There's an age-old heartbeat
Calling through the concrete
Like a marching rhyme
I've known was mine
But somehow you walk in time
Somehow you walk in time

I get all your visions, all your near collisions
Every autumn rain, weaving through your name
Nothing sounds all that strange
Nothing sounds all that strange

No, no, please
I know it's exactly what I want
And I hate how much I love to hear you tell me

3381,"THE BLUE dusk ran between the streets: my love was winged within my mind,	
It left to-day and yesterday and thrice a thousand years behind.	
To-day was past and dead for me, for from to-day my feet had run	
Through thrice a thousand years to walk the ways of ancient Babylon.	
On temple top and palace roof the burnished gold flung back the rays	
Of a red sunset that was dead and lost beyond a million days.	
The tower of heaven turns darker blue, a starry sparkle now begins;	
The mystery and magnificence, the myriad beauty and the sins	
Come back to me. I walk beneath the shadowy multitude of towers;	
Within the gloom the fountain jets its pallid mist in lily flowers.	
The waters lull me and the scent of many gardens, and I hear	
Familiar voices, and the voice I love is whispering in my ear.	
Oh real as in dream all this; and then a hand on mine is laid:	
The wave of phantom time withdraws; and that young Babylonian maid,	
One dropp of beauty left behind from all the flowing of that tide,	
Is looking with the self-same eyes, and here in Ireland by my side.	
Oh light our life in Babylon, but Babylon has taken wings,	
While we are in the calm and proud procession of eternal things."

To-night retir'd the queen of heaven
With young Endymion stays:
And now to Hesper is it given
Awhile to rule the vacant sky,
Till she shall to her lamp supply
A stream of brighter rays.

II.
O Hesper, while the starry throng
With awe thy path surrounds,
Oh listen to my suppliant song,
If haply now the vocal sphere
Can suffer thy delighted ear
To stoop to mortal sounds.

III.
So may the bridegroom's genial strain
Thee still invoke to shine:
So may the bride's unmarried train
To Hymen chaunt their flattering vow,
Still that his lucky torch may glow
With lustre pure as thine.
IV.
Far other vows must i prefer
To thy indulgent power.
Alass, but now i paid my tear
On fair Olympia's virgin tomb:
And lo, from thence, in quest i roam
Of Philomela's bower.

V.
Propitious send thy golden ray,
Thou purest light above:
Let no false flame seduce to stray
Where gulph or steep lie hid for harm:
But lead where music's healing charm
May sooth afflicted love.

VI.
To them, by many a grateful song
In happier seasons vow'd,
These lawns, Olympia's haunt, belong:
Oft by yon silver stream we walk'd,
Or fix'd, while Philomela talk'd,
Beneath yon copses stood.

VII.
Nor seldom, where the beachen boughs
That roofless tower invade,
We came while her inchanting Muse
The radiant moon above us held:
Till by a clamorous owl compell'd
She fled the solemn shade.
VIII.
But hark; I hear her liquid tone.
Now, Hesper, guide my feet
Down the red marle with moss o'ergrown,
Through yon wild thicket next the plain,
Whose hawthorns choke the winding lane
Which leads to her retreat.

IX.
See the green space: on either hand
Inlarg'd it spreads around:
See, in the midst she takes her stand,
Where one old oak his awful shade
Extends o'er half the level mead
Inclos'd in woods profound.

X.
Hark, how through many a melting note
She now prolongs her lays:
How sweetly down the void they float!
The breeze their magic path attends:
The stars shine out: the forest bends:
The wakeful heifers gaze.

XI.
Whoe'er thou art whom chance may bring
To this sequester'd spot,
If then the plaintive Syren sing,
Oh softly tread beneath her bower,
And think of heaven's disposing power,
Of man's uncertain lot.
XII.
Oh think, o'er all this mortal stage,
What mournful scenes arise:
What ruin waits on kingly rage:
How often virtue dwells with woe:
How many griefs from knowledge flow:
How swiftly pleasure flies.

XIII.
O sacred bird, let me at eve,
Thus wandering all alone,
Thy tender counsel oft receive,
Bear witness to thy pensive airs,
And pity nature's common cares
Till i forget my own."

6739,"The Bondage

The days were thronged with experience for White Fang.  During the time that Kiche was tied by the stick, he ran about over all the camp, inquiring, investigating, learning.  He quickly came to know much of the ways of the man-animals, but familiarity did not breed contempt.  The more he came to know them, the more they vindicated their superiority, the more they displayed their mysterious powers, the greater loomed their god-likeness.

To man has been given the grief, often, of seeing his gods overthrown and his altars crumbling; but to the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to crouch at man’s feet, this grief has never come.  Unlike man, whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed, vapours and mists of fancy eluding the garmenture of reality, wandering wraiths of desired goodness and power, intangible out-croppings of self into the realm of spirit—unlike man, the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh, solid to the touch, occupying earth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence.  No effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god; no effort of will can possibly induce disbelief in such a god.  There is no getting away from it.  There it stands, on its two hind-legs, club in hand, immensely potential, passionate and wrathful and loving, god and mystery and power all wrapped up and around by flesh that bleeds when it is torn and that is good to eat like any flesh.

And so it was with White Fang.  The man-animals were gods unmistakable and unescapable.  As his mother, Kiche, had rendered her allegiance to them at the first cry of her name, so he was beginning to render his allegiance.  He gave them the trail as a privilege indubitably theirs.  When they walked, he got out of their way.  When they called, he came.  When they threatened, he cowered down.  When they commanded him to go, he went away hurriedly.  For behind any wish of theirs was power to enforce that wish, power that hurt, power that expressed itself in clouts and clubs, in flying stones and stinging lashes of whips.

He belonged to them as all dogs belonged to them.  His actions were theirs to command.  His body was theirs to maul, to stamp upon, to tolerate.  Such was the lesson that was quickly borne in upon him.  It came hard, going as it did, counter to much that was strong and dominant in his own nature; and, while he disliked it in the learning of it, unknown to himself he was learning to like it.  It was a placing of his destiny in another’s hands, a shifting of the responsibilities of existence.  This in itself was compensation, for it is always easier to lean upon another than to stand alone.

But it did not all happen in a day, this giving over of himself, body and soul, to the man-animals.  He could not immediately forego his wild heritage and his memories of the Wild.  There were days when he crept to the edge of the forest and stood and listened to something calling him far and away.  And always he returned, restless and uncomfortable, to whimper softly and wistfully at Kiche’s side and to lick her face with eager, questioning tongue.

White Fang learned rapidly the ways of the camp.  He knew the injustice and greediness of the older dogs when meat or fish was thrown out to be eaten.  He came to know that men were more just, children more cruel, and women more kindly and more likely to toss him a bit of meat or bone.  And after two or three painful adventures with the mothers of part-grown puppies, he came into the knowledge that it was always good policy to let such mothers alone, to keep away from them as far as possible, and to avoid them when he saw them coming.

But the bane of his life was Lip-lip.  Larger, older, and stronger, Lip-lip had selected White Fang for his special object of persecution.  While Fang fought willingly enough, but he was outclassed.  His enemy was too big.  Lip-lip became a nightmare to him.  Whenever he ventured away from his mother, the bully was sure to appear, trailing at his heels, snarling at him, picking upon him, and watchful of an opportunity, when no man-animal was near, to spring upon him and force a fight.  As Lip-lip invariably won, he enjoyed it hugely.  It became his chief delight in life, as it became White Fang’s chief torment.

But the effect upon White Fang was not to cow him.  Though he suffered most of the damage and was always defeated, his spirit remained unsubdued.  Yet a bad effect was produced.  He became malignant and morose.  His temper had been savage by birth, but it became more savage under this unending persecution.  The genial, playful, puppyish side of him found little expression.  He never played and gambolled about with the other puppies of the camp.  Lip-lip would not permit it.  The moment White Fang appeared near them, Lip-lip was upon him, bullying and hectoring him, or fighting with him until he had driven him away.

The effect of all this was to rob White Fang of much of his puppyhood and to make him in his comportment older than his age.  Denied the outlet, through play, of his energies, he recoiled upon himself and developed his mental processes.  He became cunning; he had idle time in which to devote himself to thoughts of trickery.  Prevented from obtaining his share of meat and fish when a general feed was given to the camp-dogs, he became a clever thief.  He had to forage for himself, and he foraged well, though he was oft-times a plague to the squaws in consequence.  He learned to sneak about camp, to be crafty, to know what was going on everywhere, to see and to hear everything and to reason accordingly, and successfully to devise ways and means of avoiding his implacable persecutor.

It was early in the days of his persecution that he played his first really big crafty game and got there from his first taste of revenge.  As Kiche, when with the wolves, had lured out to destruction dogs from the camps of men, so White Fang, in manner somewhat similar, lured Lip-lip into Kiche’s avenging jaws.  Retreating before Lip-lip, White Fang made an indirect flight that led in and out and around the various tepees of the camp.  He was a good runner, swifter than any puppy of his size, and swifter than Lip-lip.  But he did not run his best in this chase.  He barely held his own, one leap ahead of his pursuer.
Lip-lip, excited by the chase and by the persistent nearness of his victim, forgot caution and locality.  When he remembered locality, it was too late.  Dashing at top speed around a tepee, he ran full tilt into Kiche lying at the end of her stick.  He gave one yelp of consternation, and then her punishing jaws closed upon him.  She was tied, but he could not get away from her easily.  She rolled him off his legs so that he could not run, while she repeatedly ripped and slashed him with her fangs.

When at last he succeeded in rolling clear of her, he crawled to his feet, badly dishevelled, hurt both in body and in spirit.  His hair was standing out all over him in tufts where her teeth had mauled.  He stood where he had arisen, opened his mouth, and broke out the long, heart-broken puppy wail.  But even this he was not allowed to complete.  In the middle of it, White Fang, rushing in, sank his teeth into Lip-lip’s hind leg.  There was no fight left in Lip-lip, and he ran away shamelessly, his victim hot on his heels and worrying him all the way back to his own tepee.  Here the squaws came to his aid, and White Fang, transformed into a raging demon, was finally driven off only by a fusillade of stones.

Came the day when Grey Beaver, deciding that the liability of her running away was past, released Kiche.  White Fang was delighted with his mother’s freedom.  He accompanied her joyfully about the camp; and, so long as he remained close by her side, Lip-lip kept a respectful distance.  White-Fang even bristled up to him and walked stiff-legged, but Lip-lip ignored the challenge.  He was no fool himself, and whatever vengeance he desired to wreak, he could wait until he caught White Fang alone.

Later on that day, Kiche and White Fang strayed into the edge of the woods next to the camp.  He had led his mother there, step by step, and now when she stopped, he tried to inveigle her farther.  The stream, the lair, and the quiet woods were calling to him, and he wanted her to come.  He ran on a few steps, stopped, and looked back.  She had not moved.  He whined pleadingly, and scurried playfully in and out of the underbrush.  He ran back to her, licked her face, and ran on again.  And still she did not move.  He stopped and regarded her, all of an intentness and eagerness, physically expressed, that slowly faded out of him as she turned her head and gazed back at the camp.

There was something calling to him out there in the open.  His mother heard it too.  But she heard also that other and louder call, the call of the fire and of man—the call which has been given alone of all animals to the wolf to answer, to the wolf and the wild-dog, who are brothers.

Kiche turned and slowly trotted back toward camp.  Stronger than the physical restraint of the stick was the clutch of the camp upon her.  Unseen and occultly, the gods still gripped with their power and would not let her go.  White Fang sat down in the shadow of a birch and whimpered softly.  There was a strong smell of pine, and subtle wood fragrances filled the air, reminding him of his old life of freedom before the days of his bondage.  But he was still only a part-grown puppy, and stronger than the call either of man or of the Wild was the call of his mother.  All the hours of his short life he had depended upon her.  The time was yet to come for independence.  So he arose and trotted forlornly back to camp, pausing once, and twice, to sit down and whimper and to listen to the call that still sounded in the depths of the forest.

In the Wild the time of a mother with her young is short; but under the dominion of man it is sometimes even shorter.  Thus it was with White Fang.  Grey Beaver was in the debt of Three Eagles.  Three Eagles was going away on a trip up the Mackenzie to the Great Slave Lake.  A strip of scarlet cloth, a bearskin, twenty cartridges, and Kiche, went to pay the debt.  White Fang saw his mother taken aboard Three Eagles’ canoe, and tried to follow her.  A blow from Three Eagles knocked him backward to the land.  The canoe shoved off.  He sprang into the water and swam after it, deaf to the sharp cries of Grey Beaver to return.  Even a man-animal, a god, White Fang ignored, such was the terror he was in of losing his mother.

But gods are accustomed to being obeyed, and Grey Beaver wrathfully launched a canoe in pursuit.  When he overtook White Fang, he reached down and by the nape of the neck lifted him clear of the water.  He did not deposit him at once in the bottom of the canoe.  Holding him suspended with one hand, with the other hand he proceeded to give him a beating.  And it was a beating.  His hand was heavy.  Every blow was shrewd to hurt; and he delivered a multitude of blows.

Impelled by the blows that rained upon him, now from this side, now from that, White Fang swung back and forth like an erratic and jerky pendulum.  Varying were the emotions that surged through him.  At first, he had known surprise.  Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped several times to the impact of the hand.  But this was quickly followed by anger.  His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly in the face of the wrathful god.  This but served to make the god more wrathful.  The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd to hurt.

Grey Beaver continued to beat, White Fang continued to snarl.  But this could not last for ever.  One or the other must give over, and that one was White Fang.  Fear surged through him again.  For the first time he was being really man-handled.  The occasional blows of sticks and stones he had previously experienced were as caresses compared with this.  He broke down and began to cry and yelp.  For a time each blow brought a yelp from him; but fear passed into terror, until finally his yelps were voiced in unbroken succession, unconnected with the rhythm of the punishment.

At last Grey Beaver withheld his hand.  White Fang, hanging limply, continued to cry.  This seemed to satisfy his master, who flung him down roughly in the bottom of the canoe.  In the meantime the canoe had drifted down the stream.  Grey Beaver picked up the paddle.  White Fang was in his way.  He spurned him savagely with his foot.  In that moment White Fang’s free nature flashed forth again, and he sank his teeth into the moccasined foot.

The beating that had gone before was as nothing compared with the beating he now received.  Grey Beaver’s wrath was terrible; likewise was White Fang’s fright.  Not only the hand, but the hard wooden paddle was used upon him; and he was bruised and sore in all his small body when he was again flung down in the canoe.  Again, and this time with purpose, did Grey Beaver kick him.  White Fang did not repeat his attack on the foot.  He had learned another lesson of his bondage.  Never, no matter what the circumstance, must he dare to bite the god who was lord and master over him; the body of the lord and master was sacred, not to be defiled by the teeth of such as he.  That was evidently the crime of crimes, the one offence there was no condoning nor overlooking.

When the canoe touched the shore, White Fang lay whimpering and motionless, waiting the will of Grey Beaver.  It was Grey Beaver’s will that he should go ashore, for ashore he was flung, striking heavily on his side and hurting his bruises afresh.  He crawled tremblingly to his feet and stood whimpering.  Lip-lip, who had watched the whole proceeding from the bank, now rushed upon him, knocking him over and sinking his teeth into him.  White Fang was too helpless to defend himself, and it would have gone hard with him had not Grey Beaver’s foot shot out, lifting Lip-lip into the air with its violence so that he smashed down to earth a dozen feet away.  This was the man-animal’s justice; and even then, in his own pitiable plight, White Fang experienced a little grateful thrill.  At Grey Beaver’s heels he limped obediently through the village to the tepee.  And so it came that White Fang learned that the right to punish was something the gods reserved for themselves and denied to the lesser creatures under them.
That night, when all was still, White Fang remembered his mother and sorrowed for her.  He sorrowed too loudly and woke up Grey Beaver, who beat him.  After that he mourned gently when the gods were around.  But sometimes, straying off to the edge of the woods by himself, he gave vent to his grief, and cried it out with loud whimperings and wailings.

It was during this period that he might have harkened to the memories of the lair and the stream and run back to the Wild.  But the memory of his mother held him.  As the hunting man-animals went out and came back, so she would come back to the village some time.  So he remained in his bondage waiting for her.

But it was not altogether an unhappy bondage.  There was much to interest him.  Something was always happening.  There was no end to the strange things these gods did, and he was always curious to see.  Besides, he was learning how to get along with Grey Beaver.  Obedience, rigid, undeviating obedience, was what was exacted of him; and in return he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated.

Nay, Grey Beaver himself sometimes tossed him a piece of meat, and defended him against the other dogs in the eating of it.  And such a piece of meat was of value.  It was worth more, in some strange way, then a dozen pieces of meat from the hand of a squaw.  Grey Beaver never petted nor caressed.  Perhaps it was the weight of his hand, perhaps his justice, perhaps the sheer power of him, and perhaps it was all these things that influenced White Fang; for a certain tie of attachment was forming between him and his surly lord.

Insidiously, and by remote ways, as well as by the power of stick and stone and clout of hand, were the shackles of White Fang’s bondage being riveted upon him.  The qualities in his kind that in the beginning made it possible for them to come in to the fires of men, were qualities capable of development.  They were developing in him, and the camp-life, replete with misery as it was, was secretly endearing itself to him all the time.  But White Fang was unaware of it.  He knew only grief for the loss of Kiche, hope for her return, and a hungry yearning for the free life that had been his."

Now that I know you do it so well
This is the end
What nonsense, darling
Why, I fixed you up last night, and I'll do it again
Oh, no, now you must rest
And then, well, don't forget
All the lovely things we planned to do today
Oh, dear

[Verse]
Lord please, I need the divine energy
So I can let the bullshit baptize in my Hennessy
Never really been the type to dead it like the Kennedys
I'm dressed in all black
It's time to refresh the memories
I'm the young legend
The bad boy
The no limit
Killing you over twice
With real name, no gimmicks
Just know that I've been riding for black excellence
That's why I'm screaming ""Diddy and Sean Carter for president""
I've been feeling kinda blue, vibin' Miles Davis
And I've been working on my mind, hoping I can save it
But in my heart, I know that my life is gorgeous
I'm watching the sun rise at 5 o' clock in the morning
I'm counting all of my blessings
Still chasing perfection
I'm trailblazing, got no need for directions
The Truman Show, I'm breaking out of the matrix
I'm taking the acid trip so I'm killing off all the basic
Boy I'm in my prime, I'm number 7
I'm walking on a fine line, that's Joseph Gordon Levitt
Boy you tryna bite my shit, that's a bad impression
Fuck the petty nonsense, I'm working on bigger questions
I'm making some big investments
Couple thousand dollar shows, this and that
If you want to go tit for tat
I'm always down to sit and rap
Break it off like Kit and Kats
How I'm being diplomatic
It's simple mathematics
Check it
I be smoking heavy boy, I haven't come down in a couple days
I'm the rookie of the year, you see me running plays
I'm always one to push the boundaries and pay homage
The cash is flowing for my day ones, Reaganomics
I'm blade running, I stay gunning for top spots
Only shit I'm dropping is top notch
The summer is just starting, tell your homies the block's hot
And tell all the ladies, if they want it, it's on spot
We on high
I had to make a couple tunes for your headtop
All these other boneheads could never make your bed rock
Chili peppers, red hot
Time is blood money, I've been wearing a red watch
Me and your girl in deadlock
Ay yo, whoever said that God could never pick favorites
All of these hoes, they KD, they ring chasing
They been snakes, I'm tiptoeing through high grass
Need to mix it up
Tell Biggs to run the high-pass
[Outro]
I'mma just let it fade it out
Yeah

Man can't tell me 'bout on-sight (Right now) 'cah I been on job
Run man down at the bus stop
Chef man's chest tryna make man's heart stop (Ying that)
It's peak when this car stop, doors get popped and everyone dart off (Dash)
Could've just left it there but fuck it, let me start off
This beef man's winning, this spin ting spinning (Brr)
All these drugs and the cutest women
Mumsy thinks I'm a saint but she don't know that her son's still sinning (Oh no)
Designer clothes but I still got smoke in my Gucci linen
Tazered who? Bruh, I think that good boy must be kidding
Or I just step with the largest shank
If your boy got splashed then Baby did it (Splash)
Them man ain't wearing no snorkel, I dive in trunks but I sent man swimming
Jailhouse days man dank out the cell
All these jakes at my door just sniffing
Send my YG's O, crackin' rocks, but I'm in the ends dishin' out tickets
Them man try back out a bat, this must be a joke, I ain't into cricket (I ain't into that)
Man's flyin' them shells, tryna hit mans head, he's pissed if I hit man's wicket (Brr)
Just thought he was linking a girl, but he didn't know the bitch just tricked him (Dickhead)
He went for a dickin', but he left that yard with his back all dripping
Run man down, make YK trip him (Trip that)
I already got him but Dubz wanna dip him
Cheekz is tapped, that corn get crashed from bro
I expect nothing less than a wiggin' (Bow)
Ayy broski, grip him
Man get diced like a piece of chicken, still got a shank in jail
If not then I swing my fists and kick him (Kick him up)
Idiot was taking a walk with his girl and I caught him slippin' (Eediat)
That's in one ear and straight out the other
He denied his block, I put it on my mother (Mum's life)
What do you mean, what do I mean?
Ayy broski, did I just stutter? Opps hate me 'cause I love my cutter
Like granny, I got two teeth in this brucker (Twinnin')
Two paigons in sight, no pickin and choosin'
I'm good with one or the other
Two paigons in sight, no pickin and choosin'
I'm good with one or the other (Either, either bitch)"
3832,"Coming back home, all that left
Frozen zinc domes, enclosing death heft
Massacre prey they silently lay
Feeling everything, but nothing they can say

“… As I write these words to you
Harsh reality is coming true
Enemies will soon attack
None of us will ever come back …”

Come back, come back, we wanted to come back
To live our lives without fierce attacks
The lack of luck has brought us to that land
To find the gruesome end, the bestial dead end

Lament of wives, daughters in tears
They put down their lives for pain and for fears
Dark and cold is the burial ground
Place where decay all of the wounds

“… Please don’t cry for us because we are here
Our spirits cannot disappear
Trapped between alive and the dead
No one hears the words we have said …”
We said, we said, we aren’t dead we said
But no one hears and no one turn their heads
Newcomers will renew the row of death
Renew the row of death, afterwards their last breath

Thousand souls they stalk in shadows
Hearing laments of their mothers
Remnants of their bodies rotten
Soldiers’ been forgotten, their lives have been forgotten

Another slain return back home in coffins

“Mother, hear me, please
Hear me, I’m alive
Mother, hear me, please
Hear me, I’m alive”"

Misery

You keep me sane
Please don't leave me here

Decide what side you're on"
8706,"Our country is cobbled lanes of London town
The valleys of Wales the Devon tides
Built on hard won freedom honour and pride

So it's crazy it seems
We've become helpless like babies again
Just waiting for someone or something
To bail us out at the slightest twinge of pain

My grandad Michael Barrett took shrapnel in the neck
Uncle Ken was a padre in Burma he returned a living wreck
Uncle John was a major and was stranded on the shoreline at Dunkirk

It's beyond my comprehension this kind of sacrifice
So many gave themselves up
And in the end so many would fall
It's not legal to say what I think anymore
Cos I don't believe in sharia law
But I can honestly say we've pissed it up the wall

Can we please stop all this madness before it's too late
No one takes responsibility and wants a free life on a plate
He can close the door switch off the light
Stick his head deep in the sand
The death throes of this green and pleasant land
Is this really where our passion goes?
Is this really where our energy flows?

I awoke on Christmas day
But Christmas is a word you can no longer say

Is this really where our passion goes?
Is this really where our energy flows?

The hospitals are just another business plan
Like justice and the law of the land
An old war hero dies of cold alone in his flat
While Brutish Gas and their shareholders are getting richer getting fat

Take only what you need and be on your way
Is this really where our passion goes?
Take only what you need and be on your way
Is this really where our energy flows?
Take only what you need and be on your way

Everybody hears but nobody listens
Empathy oh empathy
The robot people with robot answers
Invasion of the bodysnatchers is here finally
10:58 Wootton Bassett every tuesday that plane goes right over my head
Cos I can't get the drugs for cancer of the kidney my life is in the hands of
Something called Nice how nice
Is this really where our passion goes?
Take only what you need and be on your way
Is this really where our energy flows?
Take only what you need and be on your way"

This rock we're rolling on
Is like a circus ride that don't last long
Round and round we go and then we're gone
We waste time chasing ghosts
And overlook the things that matter most
We get so caught up in the maybes
Just trying to be somebody baby
I was slowly going crazy

[Chorus]
Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me
Love is really all we need
Everything else is overrated, overrated

[Verse 2]
We amputate the heart
Cause we can't let 'em see the broken part
Water down the wine and jump the shark
We build our castles tall
Just so we can have the higher walls
It don't matter where you came from
Or where it is you get your name from
We're going down if we don't change some

Building up a stack of bones
Keeping up with the Jones
Getting us all so jacked and jaded
Baby if you're asking me

We're all running after something
But if it ain't love it's nothing
It don't matter where you came from

Every day I see you turn to Me
With your repentive sighs
It's not the way I called you to be
It's time to see you through My eyes
You'll find you're not so far away
From the man I had in mind
When heart and soul are turned to Me
Consistency you'll find

Love...
The Hand that picks you up each time you fall
Love...
The reason that I answer when you call

Tied around your neck is all your pain
And you're sinking in the sand
Lift your eyes, you'll see the chain
Is breaking in My hand
You'll find you're not so far away
From the grace you hope to find
You give up pain, I give release
Now leave your past behind
Love...
The Hand that picks you up each time you fall
Love...
I'm giving you the answer to it all

Ahhhh...

Enter into Me
In your search for your identity
And you'll see
That who you are is what you'll find in Me

At the family party, I sodomise your husband
Finger her pussy and turn it into a keyboard
I work at the office, but I do it naked
Fucking pederasty, I eat hoes in the protest
I propagate Mao Tse-Tung's ideals and have sex
I downloaded an awesome porn video of Scooby-Doo
I took a pic of myself with a squeegee in my ass

My boss saw me naked and he already came hitting me

Sadomasochism happens freely in Bariloche
If you give me the pussy, I'll follow you on Instagram
The king of adultery, I'm getting a speed run
I summoned an entity ten meters high
She devastated the entire neighborhood in a beating
Triangle in the ass, New World Order

Finger her pussy and turn it into a keyboard
I work at the office, but I do it naked
Fucking pederasty, I eat hoes in the protest
I propagate Mao Tse-Tung's ideals and have sex
I downloaded an awesome porn video of Scooby-Doo
I took a pic of myself with a squeegee in my ass"
8616,"In a field littered with people
Amongst which corpses grow
Were enacted feats of war
As man was born to be killed
Your screaming is music: sing to me
Sing your pain with funeral shrieks

Kill the face, no identity
Kill the heart, rip them all apart
Kill the soul
In humanicide
Kill, don't stop
Ripsaw carnage art
Heads, torsos and limbs everywhere

This is war, this is not a crime
Make them bleed
Wash the ground with blood
Make them dead
We're running out of time
Mech-angels dancing in a whirlwind of gore
Make concvincing arguments
And a truly cleansing war

Turmoil in the east? Violence is the answer
Removed from history: Violence is the answer
Unrest in the west? Violence is the answer
Aggression, suppression: Violence is the answer
To all life's ills, violence is the answer
You deserve to die, violence is the answer
What's the question? Violence is the answer
No matter what the question, violence is the answer"

There was a bad boy in the school yard
That waited on you every day
Seemed like every time you turned around
Well, he was standin' in your way
Well, he broke your glasses, the girls all laughed
As he pushed you to the floor
Until then you stood up one day knowin'
You couldn't stand it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
And your gentle hand was finally clenched in rage
And you were face to face

[Chorus]
Face to face, with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

[Verse 2]
Your date showed up with flowers
And you thought your prayers had come
But with every passing hour
You watched it come undone
Then the night exploded and you begged him no
But he forever changed your life
And now he waits a judge and jury
Thinkin' you'll break down inside
[Pre-Chorus]
And with a finger, you can put his fists away
And you're face to face

[Chorus]
Face to face, with the devil that you've been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now sister wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

[Bridge]
'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced

[Verse 3]
Drivin' by the graveyard
On a wicked winter's eve
And you're wonderin' why a man of faith
Is whistlin' nervously
Then you stop the car and you hold your heart
'Cause you finally realize
Hell, the devil ain't in the darkness
He's a-rattlin' 'round inside

[Pre-Chorus]
And with folded hands, you truly start to pray
'Cause you're face to face
[Chorus]
Face to face, with the devil that you'd been dreadin'
Eye to eye finally has arrived
But bad as it was, well, now brother wasn't it better
Dealin' with him face to face

'Cause it'll never go away
Until the fear that you are runnin' from is finally embraced
Face to face

Left Miami with one of Taz's angels
Venezuelan, pretty skin, and her eyes are hazel
Smoked out, with a stripper, stage name is Angel
White leather inside, coke white mayo
I used to send O.G. P's in the mail
I'm in the Crestside, with my cuddies in Vallejo
Choppin' game, Bay business over everything
I lost loved ones, I'm tryna' smoke away the pain
The paint drip like the coke when the powder drain
Hopped off the plane and then a hundred sours came

8452,"Came up with something new to cover my acts
I think I want it, cause I'm over you now
I saw the past and it sometimes looked fine
Except for these little cracks wherein I could see the sky

Fire and a basket of limbs
Fire and some blood on your bed

What I meant was always of my nature and nothing else
I am what I was made to be

It's not me, It's not us
It's just this version of life I need to feed upon
Got me, crack me, Another person I hate

Came on to you and murdered your dreams
I think I won it, cause you hurt me somehow
I saw your world and it never looked real
Except for these small hours i spent inside you

Fire and a basket of flowers
Fire and the blood of the saints
It's not me, It's not us
It's just this version of life I need to feed upon
Got me, crack me, Another person I hate
Another number to call

And your wall is always there
In absence of warmth
Cold and wet
Your wall is always there

And your wall yearns for life
Life teaches doors and locks
Won't keep you out

Again she's back and I'm hypnotized
Again she's back and I'm open to lies"
186,"[Verse 1]
You think you're gonna live your life alone
In darkness and seclusion
Yeah, I know
You've been out there, tried to mix with those animals
And it just left you full of humiliated confusion
So you stagger back home and wait for nothing
But the solitary refinement of your room spits you back out onto the street
And now you're desperate and in need of human contact

And then you meet me
And your whole world changes
Because everything I say is everything you've ever wanted to hear
So you drop all your defenses and you drop all your fears
And you trust me completely
I'm perfect in every way

'Cause I make you feel so strong and so powerful inside
You feel so lucky
But your ego obscures reality and you never bother to wonder why things are going so well
You wanna know why?

'Cause I'm a liar!
Yeah, I'm a liar!
I'll tear your mind out
I'll burn your soul

I'll turn you into me
I'll turn you into me
'Cause I'm a liar, a liar
A liar, a liar

[Verse 2]
I'll hide behind a smile
And understanding eyes
And I'll tell you things that you already know
So you can say, ""I really identify with you so much""
And all the time that you're needing me
Is just the time that I'm bleeding you
Don't you get it yet?
I'll come to you like an affliction
But I'll leave you like an addiction
You'll never forget me
You wanna know why?

'Cause I'm a liar!
Yeah, I'm a liar!
I'll rip your mind out
I'll burn your soul
I'll turn you into me
I'll turn you into me

And cause you so much pain
Maybe it's something inside
Maybe it's something I can't explain

Is mess you up and lie to you

Oh, I am a liar

But if you give me just one more chance
I swear that I will never lie to you again
Because now I see the destructive power of a lie
Is stronger than truth
I can't believe I ever hurt you

I swear I will never lie to you again, please
Just give me one more chance
I will never lie to you again
No, I swear
I will never tell a lie
I will never tell a lie

Same mountain, I continue to climb

I'm workin' on both like it's nobody's business
Such an odd way to gain god's forgiveness
And all of my friends believe I should forgive myself
They insist that I've done nothing wrong

And all I wanted was for someone to keep me warm
But now I'm torn by my tolerance
I fight with my head
I don't need to pollinate a flower that's dead
And everyone I've built, I watched wilt
And everyone that has built me is killin' me
And as much as I love her
Neither one of us should suffer
So I'm a glue both the wings back on and watch her flutter
Go fly butterfly
Don't cry shut your eyes
Gonna watch each other die
Before we give it another try
Hover little hummingbird
Dart through the sky
I've been under the thumb
It's no wonder I'm still shy
Hunger, onward, with my desires
Learned the hard way not to play with fire
From a comfortable distance, I'll admire
Because I got to take a break

Holy infant so tender and mild

Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

Wait! No! Where have you gone?

How long must I stay
In a world of illusion
But where are you, you were so near
But then you were so far a apart
Hoping you'll say

Where have you been, daddy
Come into my heart

You being beautiful wasn't even the half of it
Things were going great but I battled it
I was insecure
My loneliness was something I alone created
I cultivated it with some brick and mortar
Fuck me right
I had to lose you just to figure out the fucking pecking order
You were my medication
I didn't even know that I was sick
Lots of fish in the sea
Now I'm cast away, adrift

Her voice.. so soft, humming sugar melodies

We all were lucky were born here by chance
Grew up listening to the same old song and dance
This is the land of opportunity
Think again, those rules don't apply
To all the people stuck on the other side of the borderline
Hey....but you're doing fine
Laser turrets, electric fence and a moat
Send out ships to sink refugee boats
Lock the door and swallow the key
Make the standard of living better for you and for me
A man with four children dreams of a better day
When he can make the hunger pains of his children go away
Sneaks across the border gets a job, finally has reason to believe
A bus ride home with shackles is what he receives
If the choices to make all were mine
We'd be living in a world without a single borderline"
8308,"Asking why
Shame on you
Different place
Same, erased
I just want to be your friend
And I won't believe what they’ll say
You thought I was scared with a gun on my head
Relief my pain and misery
You tried to take everything left of me
Sometimes I see you through the edge of the glass
The edge of guilt and sympathy
Someone; ain't no one to love you
Somewhere; nowhere to bе with you
Sometimes; the clock is ticking backwards
Somеthing; crystalizing carbon
Somewhere between a human and a god
A failed sense of security
The stars collide after hearing your name
Oh lord, I beg for symmetry
Open my eyes so you can give me the Light
Protect me from the beast within"

He gave away his Life
To Us—Gigantic Sum
A trifle—in his own esteem
But magnified—by Fame

Until it burst the Hearts
That fancied they could hold
When swift it slipped its limit
And on the Heavens—unrolled

'Tis Ours—to wince—and weep
And wonder—and decay
By Blossoms gradual process
He chose—Maturity

And quickening—as we sowed
Just obviated Bud
And when We turned to note the Growth
Broke—perfect—from the Pod"

The fire inside all fences will crash

Drain the colors, fade to black
Taint the pure and slip through the crack
Tear down the walls, you’ve had your chance
Forget all your fears and take control

Take me home, I’m living in an endless cold
Take me now, deliver me from all this evil

This darkness within this soul

Is this what happens when you try to fight alone?"

To spread her wings and douse the flames
It burns, it burns

She caught me on a cloud…

Take into frame
Images of evangelical piety
Drink from the wine
To taste the blood
And I think I feel contagious
Now I’m rising from the fire
Ignited, we’ll never have to drink again

I’m counting the silver lines

Lost amongst the separation of love
We’ve castrated our innocence to break the mold, as usual
I feel paranoia seeping through my skin
Confessionals, they have me wondering who’s ready to begin
Searching for an angel
To spread her wings and douse the flames
It burns
She’s been dancing on a cloud
Basking in her waves of infinite glory
I see you waiting
I see you dancing into…

We’ll be running, dancing into the avenue
We’re rejoicing as you’re shaking
We’ll be running, dancing, devoid of feeling new
And your safety can never be safely assumed

I have tasted her blood, have tasted her eyes
All the he said, the she said, it’s killing me
But what the fuck is wrong with me?
Safely assuming the worst with me
Safely assuming the worst
What the fuck is wrong?
Safely assuming the worst

I’m counting silver lines in my mind
I’m counting
I’m counting silver lines in my mind
I’m counting
I’m counting silver lines in my mind

Put ya drinks up, this a toast
Imma take you with me
In my pocket everywhere I goes

Yeah, I do this shit for you
For the fans, for the haters
Yeah, I’m crushing, not a player

I’m a rapper, I’m an addict
I’m a human with some habits
From food stamps to 5 stars
Chola living lavish

And I feel so blessed
Damn, I feel so humbled
No mumble, this some real rap
Tell me, can you feel that

Do this for my people
Cuz I can’t forget my hood
I put on for my city
Always rep it, like I should

No breaks- no, no, no
No breaks- all gas

Nigga know I'm toting on this pole, ain't no fighting
Jumped off the porch, bought a brand new Glock
Beat the block like rocket
Sold so many joes, but Youngin' dumb, I blew my profit
Stuntin 'bout them hoes, I had to stop it
Slept in so many different homes, you'd think I was adopted

Ain't tryna crash, staying in my own lane
Remember I ain't have a thing
Now i'm screaming money ain't a thing

Need a money machine to count these hunnids now
Life moving fast, niggas stuck in the past
And we gon' run 'em down
And a nigga play again, no waiting, i'm gon' gun him down
Had to get back on my grind, back to the basics
Back in my zone, leave me alone, I need new faces
Get me some new money, doing shows in new places
Cause being home too long, I fucked around and caught them case
I get lost in my thoughts, I need some peace and meditation
And i'm a fiend for them beans, thats my medication
Smokin' boof, told me stay patient

In a little place by the sea
Where we'd watch every day drift by

And if we feel sad and low
Well we could just drink it away
And sing the songs that we like
Out loud to the roaring waves

And the whispering of the reeds
Daybreak is not so very far away
Enchanted and spellbound
In the silence they lingered
And rowed the boat
As the light grew steadily strong
And the birds were silent
As they listened for the heavenly music
And the river played the song

And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

And the cloven-hoofed piper
Played in that holy ground
Where they felt the awe and wonder
And they all were unafraid
Of the great god Pan

And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

They heard a choir of birds singing
In the heavenly silence
Between the trance and the reeds
And they stood upon the lawn
And listened to the silence

And the piper at the gates of dawn
Wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn
The wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

And the piper at the gates of dawn
Wind in the willows
And the piper at the gates of dawn

How many cornfield poppy’s, how many of them red?
How many mornings spring up, how many come with dew?
Cabbage patch, nestled in, how many of them blue?
How many different places we could go
But I went low

How many midnight-summers sing, Ring a ding a littl-y
Magic spells chasing girls talking about birds and bees
Cattle calls are a calling, days are well spent
Working hard slaving away putting your heart in cement
How many different places we could go
But I went low

Watching waisted time, watch it fly by
And on the other side, clashing with the bright high-tide

Of all the diffеrent places we could go, I wеnt low

Nowadays I'm always pissed off
I'm about to punch a hole through a brick wall
Went a put all my problems in a  ziplock
Drive up and toss them off a other fucking cliff dog
Cuss truth is I've been loosing my grip
I don't drink but i feel like abusing the 5th
And writing my goodbyes and take a cruise to that cliff
Drive it straight off
Never leaving proof of that shit
A year ago
I crashed my car on purpose
Nobody knows about it
I was feeling worthless
I told myself that i shouldn't hit the brakes
Last second i realized it was a mistake
I slowed down
Thank god that i did it
But sometimes i won't lie
Still wish that i didn't
Cuss all the stress could've ended with the fatal collision
Cause of the places id been in
And i just hated the vision
I thought i had lost
I came so close just to giving up
I wanted to die
Cause i thought no one would give a fuck
I was always down on myself
I can't recall a single day where i was proud of myself
Cause every single day i thought id drown in myself
I had no fucking clue what i had found in myself to now say

I'm sorry mom
I'm sorry dad
I'm sorry eddie
I'm sorry andre
I'm sorry matt
And I'm sorry sammy

Told myself i should give myself 6 months
After that if my life didn't switch up
Only then would i have the right to give up
I lied one more after this

Pain killers take the physical pain
But what happens when I'm feeling like I'm sick in the brain
Cuss i should be happy
My fans come in thousands
But I've been more stressed since i entered the fame
I have fans
Thats a weird thing to say
It excites me when i think about a year from today
Cuss a year ago vs how i feel today
Is so drastically different
It can't be real
Theres no way
But it is
Can't come to grips with it
So think about life and how pissed it is
Still never feel like i deserve the listens
Or fans
Or the people who been trying to get with it
I still suck at school
I still work a job that i fucking hate
I still feel like I'm writing songs
That i feel like are nothing great
I'm still afraid that Ill suffocate
I still pray to god for a fucking break
He still never listens
Ill fucking wait
I wanna move to another state
So i can run away
I think nothings changed
But everything changed
Except for my mind
The stress is the same
People believe in me
I dont understand what they see in me
I'm always afraid of them leaving me
I can't see the reasons to be with me
But i can't let them down
Cuss i promised to somehow
Make everybody proud"

It traveled through the sky
A billion miles through space
Too fast for the human eye
A non-terrestrial race
Light years from home
Saturn 442
Almost caught by a supernova
Now they're coming for you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
We passed Venus and Mars
We flew around the sun
Three hundred and sixty five days
Was a lot fun
We gotta make up time
Engaged nuclear power
Hit a top speed of Uber Mach nine
Ten million miles per hour, hour, hour, hour, hour

[Verse 3]
So after fifteen years
Of buzzing 'round through space
It's time we went back home
To a familiar placе
Gotta take on fuel
Beforе we fall from the sky
Ground control to majorly wrong
You're all gonna d-d-d-d-d-d-die

3614,"In this house
On a hill
Where I’ve come to see
What is real
All I find is illusions

Urgently, she sees Spring grow
Build to a stream
On it flows
Till Autumn falls, golden
Leaves her silent, scolded

Men nearby drain fields
Hopeful for all they yield
Not wondering why the days end
With the sun in the West
At night I hang
From the ledge
By moon, Pleiades
In all shining mystery
In the house
On a hill
Where I’ve come
To need less
And many more will"
3447,"I've been having this dream
I wake up and I'm screaming
And I'm seeing things
And the doorway is a demon
Got this weight on my chest
I don't think that it's leaving
Don't know why I'm upset
Can't remember my feelings

Lately everything feels like a comedown
I fell in this pit and I can't get out
I hate the things I used to love
I'm fucked and now I'm done

I stare at the wall and I think of you
Because after all, what can I do
Your love is alcohol
Creating space between myself and all the pain I can't erase"

I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I love her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2]
We shared the years, we shared each day
In love, together, we found the way
But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3]
It took so long to realise
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now, all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years

Why do you always look at me with fear?
Why do you always hate on all the things you've never seen?
And why do you always have to turn the lights on?
I'm not coming home

I need you and you say that your love isn't true
I heard that, but the timing was just not like you
But sorry, I'm so sorry
For all I put you through

But sorry don't mean nothing
When you're hanging on your answers
All this pain you have caused
I said, sorry don't mean a thing to me

I learned my lessons
Never will I right wrongs

This simple diode modulator delivers excellent results when used for high percentage modulation at low signal levels. Constants are shown for a carrier frequency of about 10 MHz, but with a suitable tank, the circuit will give good results at any frequency at which the diode approximates a good switch. To extend frequency above that for which the IN4148 is suited, a hot-carrier diode can be substituted. A shunt resistor across the tank circuit can be used to reverse the circuit Q... reduce the circuit Q so as to permit high percentage modulation without appreciable distortion.‌

These are modulator circuits for modulation of video signals on a VHF/UHF carrier. The circuits require a 5V power supp... power supply and few external components for the negative modulation mode. For positive modulation an external clamp circuit is required. The circuits can be used as general-purpose modulators without additional external components. The IC is TDA6800.‌

This circuit permits direct connection of composite video signals from video games and microcomputers to the antenna terminals of TV sets.​

By applying a variable M/S ratio flip-flop to these inputs, both speed and direction will be controlled. With RV1 in its center position the M/S will be 1:1... 1:1, whereby the motor will remain stationary due to its inability to track at the flip-flop frequency…  the flip-flop frequency.

Cash in your ignorance, learn about the truth
And it's no playground, it's one big letdown
It looks like a backstreet bargain baby
But you just got screwed

And on that high road you live in shadows
And the one that follows is your silent twin
And it's a sad reminder
That when you try to find her
She's back on the old main drag in trouble again

Ten Hail Marys and she's ready to score
Dealing with the damage of a grown-up war
But turning tricks and tourniquets
Are nothing more than another wasted day

Cinderella's on the corner with her eyes in tears
Waiting for the moment when the magic appears
They expected her home for the past two years
I guess she lost her way
The tide is always turning
Deep inside your desire's burning
And you're dying just to get away

You thought you had it down
When you first came to this town
Now you're begging for a helping hand
And a brand-new day
You're begging back all that Seven Sisters took away

Can you get it back again?
Get it back again

And a ski-mask with friends in psychwards, jail cells, and rehabs
Turned apartments into beat labs, 'til I got evicted
Charged with an armed robbery, but never got convicted
I'm not vindictive, I'm something worse that's way beyond that
I skip the arguments and go straight to combat
Keep your contract bazzelisk <--(?), I'm not for sale
Any vampiric parasite that crossed my path, got impaled
Surprised I'm not in jail, I'm too elusive
New exclusive albums every couple years, then back to reclusive
Your tattoos look stupid, what fuckin' tribe you in
As police sirens spin, I only hear the violins

Chorus:
In a life of madness, what would you expect an author to write
As darkness approaches, I refuse to walk toward the light
Thinking, I would never thrive in the corporate life
This is the diary of a vagabond, walking at night
[2X]

[Verse 2:]

Yo, I was a wronged child, with a grin on my face, but no smile
Outcasted, never adapted, but always had my own style
I was so wild, leather couch visits, at a young age
So many problems at school, they couldn't fit them all on one page
I had dumb rage, not dumb as in stupid, but dumb like a lot
Out of all the kids in my hood, I was the baddest one on the block
Yelling at grown ups, reach for the kitchen knife and pull it out
I remember cops came, when I tried to blow up my neighbor's house
I had a reputation, and I never took my medication
A genius, mistaken for a fuckin' mental patient
In the basement, I used my father's tools to make some nice weapons
Then used those tools to teach other people life's lessons
I liked steppin' out of line, but I would drift back
While you were grounded, I was selling weed and drinking six packs
Getting into mishaps and growing as a result
I had more respect then, than you have now as an adult

[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]

Yeah, yo
As I proceed to grow I keep this on a basis that's need to know
""Are you still doing music?"", yes, ""Cool, are you sleeping?"", no
To each his own, fine, then I want everything
Settle for nothing, remove cotton from gloves and enterings
Let's do this old school, before lawsuits and pro-tools
When foes dueled, 'cause new music is diluted like old dudes
It tastes like something's missing, so I'm posting up in kitchens
The feeling, filling in the gap of chicks I stuck my dick in
In public pissing, drunk as fuck, with a bone to pick
I used to play sports, catching cases, and throwing fists
And I won't enlist in any army except for my own
I'm a soldier that went AWOL on a quest for the throne
Protecting my home, rowdy as fuck, so adjacent neighbors
Are in trouble, like a kid about to conversate with strangers
It should say danger on yellow signs surrounding me
'Cause I don't got shits, so how the fuck are you gonna beat it out of me

[Chorus]"

I just left Malibu, mood on gratitude
I can't be ungrateful with a lavish view
Crazy what just dedication planning and some passion do
Planting seeds, life in here be sweeter than a passion fruit
God's Earth came away from Wadsworth Avenue
Agency gon' pay the fee for places that we travel to
Got it out the gravel too, it was where the grasses grew
I'm the only one I could compare me to, we are not one and the same
Like, do I really gotta explain the underdog really off of the chain
Actions follow every quote that I bang, manifested, I don't talk it in vain
I'm cold, I done sat and talked with Jermaine
I got the blessin' from Nas, had the session with Game
And every spectrum when you echo the name
The West Coast secret weapon to blame
Greatness, only thing that's left in my vein
I'm LaMelo, ballin' fresh in the game
But I'm not the two today, feeling like a newer Ye
Choose first two today, might bring 'em to the stu' today
Show 'em how we move away, he won't have to move this way
Workin' countless hours so my child can have a roof to lay under
I've been feelin' like Mustard, I want ten straight summers
And you ain't gotta like it, but the hood gon' love us
Actin' unexcited when you big fans of us, you can't skip past numbers

510,"Don’t let anybody in; it’s not part of the plan
Sustain the innocence of holding on to an invented condition
Don’t hold back as you preach the sin, a promise made to your constituents
Dig in and expand the division; power gained in a sheltered position

It starts with one; it’s come undone
Let them burn at every single stage until they fade away
Suffocate the dignity
Impurity

One more name to feed the fire; burn without an ounce of grace
So long, the crude and vile drew no question to their fate
How have you paved a way to feed on those less than half your age?
All acclaim you take and take while the victims bleed until their dying days

It starts with one; it’s come undone
Let them burn at every single stage until they fade away

Take back all of your signs from those supporting your kind
Abandon your vicious right, and stand down from the spotlight"

Tryin to see how much weed you can take in your system
Indeed, take out the seeds, then he finished his sentence

Six niggas died from homicide and drug shootins

From drugs abusin, this is thug amusin
Bloods and Crips, huggin the strips
Lovin they clips, sittin on dubs in they whips
Folks, GD's and vice lords, when night falls

Harder to hid that there is something wrong

4239,"It's a game
A game and nothing more
A game I love but then again
I knew there'd come a moment when I'd close the door
My life I always knew was either or
The game is part of me it's true
But there are other people too I can't ignore
But when I'm out there in the cold
And it's just moments from the end
And the crowd is going wild
And there's this shot we need to bend
I'll miss my friend
My girl, my crazy friend
Who changed my game

It's a game
This day it's just a game
A little secrecy and skill
You disappear, the show will still go on the same
So play the game
I know, I know, I'd be the first to say
That it's your duty to be here
But here you are now disappear
And make the game
It's a game, to her it's all a game
To her it's nothing but a laugh
And once she's found her better half
She'll lose the flame
And as for me I'm mad to feel this way
To feel I'm more than just a friend
To keep on trying to pretend she feels the same
And yet the girl can really play
In ways I've never seen before
And I can see the way she dreams
And how her spirit dares to soar
And then I'm sure
She's sure it's so much more
Than just a game

Such a beautiful day
Such a masterful plan
It's a beautiful day
[?]
Babaji, Babaji, are you there?
Bless this day, bless this pair
It's a beautiful thing
It's your game

[?]
That's right, your special game
The game you've talked so much about
No way your mum was missing out
So look who came
Let's not let you-know-what be some big deal
When as they say, push comes to shove
Black, bi or gay I'll always love you just the same
You're not to blame
You can't decide which way you swing
It shouldn't ever be a thing to bring you shame
Now win that game"

Yo its the godfather, boss in the flesh, murdering symphonies
Y'all gotta pause when we step into the scenery
I'll much rather talk with these peasants from a distance gee
It's nothing personal unless niggas is beefing me
Then I smoke you like nicotine
Don't even intervene, what I spit is mean
The murder scene, is squeaky clean
Tryna get a-head of me, end up in a guillotine
Hilary and GEM.In.I? I'll show you what the difference mean!
Hilary is loving, you never think nothing of him, unless you pressing his button, then GEM.In.I will intervene
Then all of sudden, you niggas gonnaz be bugging and wish you never thought in your life to ever mess with me
I'm on mission of spitting lyrical writtens
You thinking I be quitting this art, you must be kidding
I was born with it
And when I die, I'll be gone with it
The tombstone's carrying all of my songs in it
I'm elevating, mildly meditating
The bars too sick and the flow's the medication
I'm giving full dose of my rhymes to any patient
Dr. GEM.In.I with the cure to every ailment
I'm numero uno fam, cooler than pluto damn
Gat my crew and fans, who show me love when I do a jam
Life is a paradise (pair-of-dice) like ludo man
Hiphop's finest GEM.In.I and duno man

Life is the reason that I write I'm writing
Sacrifice my life like Christ for the righteous
Spitting metaphors, punchlines on the mic
Is my own therapy for my crisis

So I go back to the music
Its back to the music
Its back to the music
Its back to the music cuz
Hiphop till the death of me, and real rap that recipe
So Shine On!

[Verse 2: Duno]
The street Knows, the golden ring is still on that pigs nose
People with poor spirit are dressed in rich clothes
Slaves are riding on the horses when the Prince strolls
Telling me the game is growing but I don't think so
Cuz this growth is more like a cancer
And these rappers looking more like the dancers
Raping the game every time they gat a chance to
Me I'm a militant, I'm something like a panther
My plans to, whoop you rappers in the open
I'm exposing all the bones in your closet
I'm the chosen golden child
Those opposing getting eroded, I'm cold, I froze ocean
No, I'm not boasting, I'm smoking hot till yall roasting
It shows my flows cause commotion
The fans notice the fire in my eyes
I'm the real truth while you just a liar in disguise
Never tiring, my everyday desire is to rise
Above materialism inspiring the wise
Spitting like, visualize it, amma shine it your eyes
I be firing, killing till the sirens arrive
And this is not the kind that they playing on the radio
On a daily yo, its not 'IF' or 'Daddy Yo'
Hiphop is living, don't believe in what they telling you
You just gotta follow her wherever where she go
[Chorus: Duno]
Life is the reason that I write I'm writing
Sacrifice my life like Christ for the righteous
Spitting metaphors, punchlines on the mic
Is my own therapy for my crisis

So I go back to the music
Its back to the music

It's only cause i'm doing everything to try to find you(trying to find you)

Called you my wife
I made you smile i made you cry we even had a fight
I told you that i was sorry so i gave you my life
Everything is getting much harder 'cause you're really gone

2984,"They say times are hard for dreamers
But they won't be hard for me
I've saved up everything I know
To take that step beyond the lawn
Keep walking till I see the station
And then see it go

Inside the train, out through the glass
My finger tracing
All of these towns I've never heard of racing past
Off the train in Paris, half a mile from Sacré-Cœur
The city's waking up for me
A sign says an apartment's vacant on the second floor
And suddenly I hold a key

I turn a lock, the rooms appear
And all it takes is one more step, and then I'm here
Just me behind my door!
It isn't what I have, it's only what I have in store
That matters now, the past can only fade
And everything I'll ever need is here
This is how my world gets made
They say times are hard for dreamers
And who knows, maybe they are
People seem stuck, or lost at sea!
And I might be a dreamer
But it's gotten me this far
And that is far enough for me

Look out my window there's a view, of other windows
My own museum full of paintings I look through
Where everything is clear
It isn't where I am, it's only where I'll go from here
That matters now, and I am not afraid
As everything I'll ever need appears
This is how my world gets made"

See the shit, in my past
Tell myself I can't go back
If I do then this won't last
This dream I'm livin movin fast
Hear her voice, see her face
She tells me that it's okay
Come with me, take it slow
Quietly I hear her say

Shadiness and lots of lies is basically my past in a rhyme
The stupid shit and crazy times they come  to haunt me every night
These ghosts and demons of my deeds
They hold me hostage make me plead
Don't manifest yourself to them
You'll show them who I was they'll see
The reason no one fuck with me
I'll pay my dues I'll pay my fees
I'll sail with you across the seas
And kill you, leave you to the breeze
Or rather keep you locked inside
That side of me she cannot find
I have to do this have to grind
To keep all this shit off my mind

It leaves me till it's out of sight
The dreams I had they coming true
The little pictures that I drew
I wanna tell her wanna say
That everything i do for you
Problem is, now she know
Everything I did befo
See my failures my mistakes
And told me we can't be no mo
So here I am, all alone
Waiting starting at my phone
Knowing that this chance I've blown
Won't come back, that's it, I'm gone

Asking me how I've been
Tell you fine, but I'm lyin

You tell me that you missin us
You tell me you don't give a fuck
About my past you giving up
The reasons that we had to breakup
Text you back right away
Hope that one of these days
Maybe we return the way

Run down
Forced out
Stay down
Get out
Sprinting for an unknown fate
Get aboard before it's too late
As we push off I begin to mourn
Forced from a land I love for unknown shores
Amidst the chaos of an angry sea
I pray to god it doesn't swallow me
A prayer that would go unheard
I've entered a fight from which I would not return

As I come undone
And as the water fills my lungs
I use my last bit of hope
To wish that one day
I'll make it home

Take me home

With only one wish to take me home

I always thought my time would come more peacefully
With family, not freezing water surrounding me
I'll just give in because now it's clear to me

Prior to the 1880s, paints were alloyed in artists’ studios with hand-ground materials, but against the end of the 19th century, advance in the actinic industry brought tubes of premade acrylic to abundance shelves. (Today, the Munch Museum in Oslo houses added than 1,400 such acrylic tubes endemic by the artist.) Highly saturated automated pigments lent artists’ creations vibrancy, but these paints were rarely, if ever, activated for longevity.

Monday morning I am off again
Longing for the week to end
Got the time but no do to spend
Fame and fortune won't be my friend
Oh no here she go

Oh my love you just lost again
You don't know how to play the game
You don't know how to get over it

Standing in the wellfare-line
Wasting all my precious time
Go get a job and you'll be fine
Shove it where the sun don't shine

Everybody goes flagelagelag flagelagelag...

Working on my bride to be
Hope that she will stay with me
Playing her is pretty rough
Well never seems to get enough
Oh my love you...
You dont know...
And everybody in the choir sings corny songs

Oh my love you..."

You cried a sullen tear to release my fears in here
I'm incapable of tears and I'll climb the ladder I fear
Hoping I can find love but not in you! You!

Somehow I wish there was more to this....More to this!
And I corrupt it!
And I bury it!
And I breathe life into it!
When I need it!

This is my message to U!
Why do I feel forsaken?
When you're only teaching me
What's the use in me?
To rape my memories?
To give me an eternal sting
How do I compensate for the loss
Of a broken memory?
Somehow I wish there was more to this....More to this!
And I corrupt it!
And I bury it!
And I breathe life into it!
When I need it!

It only stings for a moment!
Some of these people are so ungrateful!
That we she stings it's forever!"

Baby, why the hell you acting so cold?

Verse 1:
Got some 1942 inside my cup
Imma keep on drinking till I feel like throwing up
Do me like some quicksand had me feeling stuck
I don’t know what I’ve been doing but I’ve had enough
Of your old ways
And your little games
Thought I’d stay but you going through a hoe phase
Want a piece of me but I give you the whole thing
Wanna treat me like a puppet try to pull strings
But you can’t girl
Cause I’m too quick
Could never trust you with a lot you got loose lips
Need to get rid of that Kylie get a glue stick
I just hit the Ruth Chris
Ordered me like two strips

Always worried bout all of the people who unfollow you
Kind of funny now cause Imma be the one who follows through

But you the one who gave up trying to leave me
So why are you always acting like you need me
Cause it’s over girl

Verse 2:
I ain’t worried bout it

I forgot about you Sarah Marshall Russell Brand elevated living got me seeing shit enhanced

You know I control the future had to manifest my destiny
I grew up around the Cajuns and the Creole‘s got the recipe I could promise anything you saying never gone be stressing me
Try to beat me to the punch you gonna do it unsuccessfully
Best believe
This is like a specialty
Learned it from the mountains full of problems I had slept beneath
Now I’m waking up my bank account looks like the debt relief
Built it up tremendously

Get the loot and out the floor we gotta roll
Shit cold, it's just audio dope being sold
How many more times motherfuckers gotta be told
But they want us to fold, shop close
Relocate, we just opened one more
Left the majors alone
Made that same paper on my own
Reciting Comega lyrics through a megaphone
Or jamming Raekwon purple tape in my lavender Wraith
Moet bottles, champagne showers
Bitches in Gucci ski goggles, Instagram models
Following everybody but God
I'm a sinner though I talk to the lord often
Living large and dealing with temptation is hard
I smashed her in the Sprinter in the parking lot
After awards, I never made it in
Fuck it, who would have ever noticed if I even did
Low as I is
Smoked out at the crib or lowriding with Wiz
Scooped him from the airport like fool get in
2009 anniversary ten would be in 2019
So dropping it then just makes sense
This a holdover to the real stones
Which one of you got a lighter you can loan me
Rolling up another zone on my lonely
Eastside to my motherfucking homies"

Never worn out but I'm dressed for the occasion
I'm hear to be a messenger
Not the type on Instagram
Living a facade just to get a couple followers
I'm here to be a realist
Dreaming for a few of us
Trying to live a happy life as simple as a new born
Uhh

I just wish that I could skip right to the part where I'm not lost (I'm not lost)

But the expectation's growing what if I'm not fast enough (fast enough)"

And your purple tractor that sings
Hey, come tell me all of those things

Think you can
Oh baby, tell me 'bout your lover man
You know I'm talking 'bout him

He's one that's stealing my scene away

Oh baby, won't you tell me 'bout your black rose?
And the garden where your love grows
Among the cabbages and beans
Hey, come tell me why your primroses are green
But if you want to tell me some more
Think you can
Oh baby, tell me 'bout your lover man
You know I'm talking 'bout him

5048,"It is hard to rank the likely victims of a war in Iraq, but there can be little doubt that the 4 million Kurds of Iraq, who for the moment have achieved unusual progress in the northern enclaves under the uneasy alliance of Masoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, are in particular danger.

Anders Lustgarten may prove to be right in his warning that “none stand to lose more than the occupants of Iraqi Kurdistan,” and that “any successor to Saddam will see the Kurdish threat to Baghdad in the same light”. Apart from their vulnerability to murderous Iraqi assault, and the anticipated Turkish reaction if there is any hint of a move towards meaningful autonomy, some 60 per cent rely for survival on the UN ‘Oil for Food’ programme, according to studies by humanitarian organizations, which is likely to be severely disrupted in the event of war.

“Free Kurdistan is like a huge refugee camp,” one Kurdish leader commented: it is dependent on UN-run programmes for food and on Baghdad for fuel and power. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees is planning for the possible flight of hundreds of thousands to neighbouring countries, where they are not likely to receive a warm welcome, and where the prospects for the indigenous Kurdish populations are sufficiently grim even without what might lie ahead.
But there are some real signs of hope in the Middle East.

It is obvious that the rich and powerful countries, primarily the US and Britain, will have an enormous influence on future development, as they have had in the past. And in free societies, where fear of repression is slight, that means that popular forces and independent organizations like the Kurdish Human Rights Project can have a decisive influence. For 10 years the KHRP has compiled a stellar record in promoting and significantly advancing the cause of human rights in this tortured part of the world. In the coming years, its tasks will be even greater, and its concerns will reach well beyond the Kurds, severe as their problems are.

Other reasons for hope are internal to societies where severe repression and violence reign. I was greatly privileged to catch a glimpse of this in Turkey a few months ago when I visited Istanbul and Diyarbakir, the capital of the Kurdish southeast. Much to my surprise, I came back feeling far more optimistic than when I went. It was truly inspiring to witness first-hand the courage and dedication of the leading artists, writers, academics, journalists, publishers and others who carry on the daily struggle for freedom of speech and human rights, not just with statements but also with regular acts of civil disobedience. Some have spent a good part of their lives in Turkish prisons because of their insistence on recording the true history of the miserably oppressed Kurdish population: sociologist Ismail Besikci, to mention one notorious case, was arrested 11 years ago for publishing a book on state terror in Turkey, having already spent 15 years in prison. He also refused a $10,000 prize from the US Fund for Free Expression in protest against Washington’s strong support for Turkish repression, which is virtually unknown in the West, in accord with the standard principle that one’s own crimes must be effaced.

Unlike Dr. Besikci, the first Kurdish woman elected to Turkey’s parliament, Leyla Zana, did not refuse the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought seven years ago. As she wrote when she received it, “the jailers who lock my body behind the thick walls of an Ankara prison do not have the power to prevent my spirit from travelling freely.” She is still serving a 15-year sentence for having worn traditional Kurdish colours and for her crime when she took her oath of office in 1991. She read it in Turkish as required but then added in Kurdish: “I shall struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish people can live peacefully together in a democratic framework.” Just last week, Amnesty International renewed its appeal to the Turkish authorities to release her. As in the case of other courageous and prominent dissidents in Western domains, including those who were brutally murdered, her name is virtually unknown in Britain and the United States.

There seems to be a good deal of public support in Turkey for the people who are carrying out the struggle for free speech and human rights, people who should inspire not only great respect but also humility among their Western colleagues. No less inspiring was what I saw on a visit to Diyarbakir, where many of those driven from the countryside live in caves in the outer walls of the city and in its slums, still barred from return to their villages despite programmes that have been officially announced but not implemented. Human Rights Watch described this non-implementation as perhaps the most serious of the current human rights violations in Turkey. Conditions appear to be even worse for the unknown numbers trying to survive in condemned buildings in miserable slums of Istanbul, where large families are crammed into a room, young children are virtually imprisoned unable to venture into the grim alleyways outside, while some older brothers and sisters work in illegal factories to help keep the family alive.

The courage of the people is beyond my ability to describe, from the children in the streets wearing Kurdish colours — a serious offence, for which punishment of the families could be severe — to the members of a large and enthusiastic public meeting I attended in Diyarbakir. At the end, several students came forward and in front of TV and police cameras, presented me with a Kurdish-English dictionary. That was an act of considerable bravery, and a precious gift; right at that time students and their parents were being interrogated, reportedly tortured, and facing imprisonment for submitting legal petitions requesting the right to have elective courses in their native language.

Denial of even these minimal rights is cruel beyond words. The Kurds have the support of many brave and honourable people in Turkey. They ask only that we offer them every form of assistance within our reach, and that we do what we can to help them achieve their worthy and justified aims — which means, in particular, putting an end to our critically important contribution to the repression and violence to which they are subjected.

There have been some real effects of internal struggle and outside pressure. In August 2002, the Turkish Parliament passed new laws that have a good deal of promise. The new government subsequently extended them in ways that could prove important. Recent KHRP newsletters outline both the promise and the barriers to its realization, calling on us to support the people of Turkey in overcoming the repressive acts of the Turkish state.
The current record is mixed. There is general agreement that day-to-day repression has been mitigated. On the other hand, the report released by the respected Izmir Bar Association for Human Rights Day records increases in human rights violations (as throughout the world, under the pretext of combating terrorism), including hundreds of credible reports of torture, thousands of trials for ‘thought crimes’, a continuation of the ‘situation of emergency rules’ despite the formal lifting, the bars against return to the villages, and other serious abuses.

The Publishers Union of Turkey reported a “rising trend” of banning of books and accusations against authors and publishers, as well as music and other publications. Kurds and Kurdish issues remain the primary targets, but are not the only ones; even a dictionary about women’s slang was banned, also a grammar and dictionary of a local Greek dialect.

A great many people in Turkey heed Leyla Zana’s call “to struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish people can live peacefully together in a democratic framework.” They need our support, and with it, there might even come a day when Turkey will be the “homeland for Turks and Kurds” — the phrase used by Ataturk’s lieutenant and eventual successor at the foundation of the Turkish nation-state 80 years ago."

Remember waking up to days always feeling empty
I had a lot I wanted to say that shit was heavy
Only had a few friends I never trusted any
I was all to myself cuz they be full of envy
Depression on my mind suicidal thoughts
I really wanted to die but I really fought
I took it day by day and I was so exhausted
One night I popped so many pills tryna to off it

[Verse 1]
And I still can't believe I woke up alive
A new persona, really though that I died
I sat vomiting, I was so happy that I cried
That was the day I saw the future with my eyes
A new school year Imma put my mind to it
Not on some nerd shit, just saying I ain't blind to it
Blind to the people tryna fuck with a real nigga
The people tryna shoot me then say that I pulled the trigger
Nah that ain't how this is finna go down
I know now, just how everything goes now
I know just how these niggas gon fold now
But I know so well that I'd never slow down
As days passed I never give up on myself
There's some good coming I would just say to myself
And I waited for it played with the cards i was dealt
Walked in a new class feeling like something else
It was different it felt like I belonged there
Just chilling with the homies none' wrong there
But some else it was like something that I want there
Then I saw her like I was instantly drawn there
I had already given up on what I seen
I had so many rejections like fourteen
In the back of my mind she the girl of my dreams
But I never said a word cause she so out of my league
My homie Shawn he stuck wit me he the OG
He had my back since I caused a scene that wasn't me
Like Billie Jean he knew my past and he came clean
He told me that he knew the chick that I wanna see
I said ""I don't know man, don't wanna fuck up my vibe""
You don't got nothing to lose so why don't you just try
I said you right, I slid into the DMs on that night
Stayed up talking for a while getting real tight
[Bridge]
Then I felt it for the first time
What they all say on the grapevine
Tension rising all up in my c Klein's
I was levitating when I wasn't high
I wanna get to know you better, when I met her
Any pain I would en devour, I wouldn't let her
I know you clever, It would be my pleasure
I just wanted to impress her, until forever

[Verse 2]
And all it took was a few b ball games
And few more nights staying up late
& you know how I felt cause it felt great
At Micky D's I tried to ask her out on a date
I had my expectations down to a no
But with a smile on her face reality was shown
She put her arms around me then I just froze
Is that a yes? I was praying cause only god knows
She just nodded with a laugh and she said yes
Then we went for the hug again I felt so blessed
Then she got her face close and I couldn't take a guess
Like chess we was playing till she lent in for the kiss
First date nothing big we went to Starbucks
I was starstruck by the things that she told me
We went for so long till I knew she not a harlot
A good startup her parents didn't know me
[Bridge 2]
Then I had everything that I ever wanted girl
I had somebody so that I could be honest girl
Hoping you love me for me when I'm really on it girl
You said you love me first and we was bonding girl

[Verse 3]
Two months in and we was feeling alive
We could both agree it was the time of our lives
Then you left my for some friends said it'd only be a night
You got me so fucked up when you took more time
I never felt so rejected ever in my life
She would use like she need me then she put me aside
Then she came running back when I wanna divide
She said that god will help us and then she start crying
I told her that I just don't wanna get hurt again
My nigga Shawn talked to her like a good friend
She promised she would fix shit she did not pretend
She stuck with me for so long like we co-depended
You said you never needed nobody but me girl
We spent so much time so I believed girl
You can't ""un-love"" there's no delete girl
Then the day came where you said you wanna leave girl
Your best friend say you changed since you been with me
How's that my fault I'm not the enemy
But y'all his this shit all rigged like the industry
When you turned your back on me you knew it was the end of me"

All the nihilists would write

To hold an abyss in his hands?

You would know that he’s not far
You would know that he’s not far
I wish you could hear his voice
You would know that he’s not far
Would you still be there when he pushes you away?
I think that you will be

Singing like a stuffed bird
Lying like a snake in the garden
And hiding like a savior

That I etched with my love
Is something to remind you of me
And every horror I remind you of
Everyone that touches you
Will know what you've done
By the dirt that covers your skin
And by the pieces of your heart
That were once one
Lock the memories in a box
And put them away
For you to discover once more
Know that I will always be there
Through the good the bad, sick, dead and the poor
I will taste the fruits of your flesh
I will suffocate everything in my way
I will destroy the home we once built
I will bury all that was our life
Is this search for a common comfort
Even worth what we are going through
I've never experenced this
Don't let your feelings for me
Get in the way of how I run your life
This aquired taste is only a fad
And the love we shared was something we never had"

Thankful i grew up with both parents
Loving parents
It’s a blessing just to be able to be who you are
Adopted as a baby
Wide-eyed, memories hazy
Thankful they saved me
From a life of too many “maybes”
Like maybe you’ll find a family
And maybe go off to college
And just maybe live long
They were strong and i promise I’m

Facing a judge that could’ve killed this shit and locked away my youth
17, life came at me fast
Really thought that I could get away wit’ 12 on my ass
Fools
We was riding wit bb guns that looked like real tools
Fuck the judge, we was lucky enough that we ain’t make the news
Fuck the gangsta shit in life when you got a lot to lose (lot to lose)
Either you bout’ the life or not and you can’t pick and choose

Put my parents through the worst just to feel amused (feel amused)
But I do this all for them I guess im paying dues (paying dues)
My nephew 5 now and picked up basketball at school
My niece get bigger everyday, and now she talking too
They what I think about whenever I’m bout’ to lose my cool
Fam over everything
Can't fuck wit’ you if you break the rule
Every year around this time I just like to reminisce (reminisce)
About all the times, all the hoes, and all of the bullets missed (missed)
Rest in peace to those we lost too damn quick

965,"[Chorus: Celly En Noir]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my-
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Celly En Noir]
Like, okay flash, hundred on me, hundred on my dash
Friends like these never hope I crash
I'm so good I know I'm never goin' out bad
I'm so hot I can't go out sad
I go hot, get inside my bag
Say the word, I'm on my way without a doubt right there
Don't know if I woke up from the dream or if I'm 'bout to have a nightmare
I know you [?][0:56] but everyday it's like you're right there (Uhh)
Everyday it's like you're right there
[Verse 2: Celly En Noir]
Ain't it good if we came, diamonds on my rings
I walk in the crowd and I hear everybody sing
I don't got no space for all the presents that they bring
Anything and everything I know it's all for me
Ain't it good if we came, diamonds on my rings
I walk in the crowd and I hear everybody sing
Such a shame, I don't feel a thing
Even when I see all the presents that they bring
My name- screamin' my name
I'll go grab a rope and if they don't I'll let 'em hang
I've changed, I know I've changed
But ever since you left nothing really felt the same
Ooh, ain't it good to be king
Oh, ain't it good to be king
Ain't it good to be king
Ooh-

[Chorus: Celly En Noir & CDG and Only CDG]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'

I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
[Verse 3: CDG]
Okay I wanna be a king, fame and diamond rings
And designer things, look at all this bling
And this bad lil' thing up on my wing, she like how I sing
All this energy I bring, you can't play me like a string
Talkin' shit, I don't give a fuck 'bout what you think
I don't care, might seem like a dream but everyday's like a nightmare
Feel like you're a thousand miles away but you're right there (Ooh)
Every night you're right there (Ooh)

[Outro: CDG]
I can hear it now the bells are ringin'
It sounds so good with the choir singin'
I feel down deep in my soul is feelin'

I need ya to take your time right now
We're gonna slow it down, you know?
So roll that spliff, pour that ya

And feds took all of man's shit, pissed
Man was in the station for 3 days, you know
Come out with no Ps

I had to find a shot
*'member that?*

Man hit that M-way [?] cut

[Verse 1]
Had a nightmare I went broke it's just me and Likkle T again
No one else wanted to be my friend
I'm all alone like a scarecrow
I put my last 20 in this roulette box, I really need a zero
My trainers look fucked up
I need to get a haircut
Plus this pedal bike got my joggin bottoms teared up
I feel like to do a mad ting
I swear I'd rob all them niggas callin me a hasbeen
It's comin like a broken mirror
I ain't net all day, now I'm eatin toast for dinner
I used to fly birds now the run's over
24 sleepin on my mum's sofa
I can't move keys, I got a dead line
Prep'ed all my deeds to bill a bedtime
Wish I could ask my guy for a loan
I woulda been rich if my nigga Hydro was home

'Member when I lost all my P's in a booky
I had a likkle safe in my case and I cleaned out everything
Imagine, no one believed that I was broke too

Tellin man on Thursday like ""Are you dumb, you can't be broke""
Consign a ting [?]
Gang robbed that, so now I'm 18 bills minus 8

[Verse 2]
Had to pinch myself, I hope this is a dream
Cuh niggas that I thought were mandem's nowhere to be seen
I guess they all went when I pour my jewels
Dropped the last video and got 40 views
I shoulda stayed on this rap ting and started doin shows
Instead of movin Os
Entertainin stupid hoes
Now I'm stuck on the streets cuh that's all I know
I shoulda stayed on that plumbing course, saved all my dough
Thinkin 'bout when me and Midge had the newest whip
Flyin birds since 14, I ain't used to this
My nigga that I brought in never wanna know me
He had a new connect and a new [?]
My niggas stopped showin love, and all my bitches too
But watch how I bounce back when I flip this Q
It made my heart melt
When my mum's got bills to pay and I can't help"

Shoot 'em all down with a flash of your pearly smile
Honey, but you met your match tonight
That's right

You think you knock me off my feet 'til I'm flat on the floor
'Til my heart is crying out and I'm begging for more
So c'mon baby, c'mon baby
C'mon baby, show me what the loaded gun is for

If you can give it, can take it
But if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough, c'mon and prove it
Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose
Tonight, you're gonna go down in flames
Just like Jesse James
You're an outlaw lover and I'm after your hide
Well, you ain't that strong, won't be long 'til your hands are tied
Tonight I'm gonna take you in dead or alive, that's right

You break the laws of love in the name of desire
Take ten steps back, 'cause I'm ready baby, aim and fire
Baby, there's no way you're gonna run tonight

Well, you've had your way with love but it's the end of the day
Now a team of wild horses couldn't drag your heart away
So c'mon baby, c'mon baby
C'mon baby, you know there ain't nothing else to say

If you can give it, can take it
But if this heart is gonna break, it's gonna take a lot to break it
I know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight

Your heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose
Tonight, you're gonna go down in flames

Crossing the water
Lead them to die

Press for the river, press for the rain
We press for the water

Here comes the break down, ka-ra-te chop! Raise up your arms, make an X if you're down. Me and my crew, we own this stinkin' town. Watch out for my fist, your face it will kiss on purpose. I'm tough and I'm ticked

I don't slow dance, I don't salsa dance, forget the tango. I don't slam dance you idiot, I dance hardcore. On the floor, I'm the man you've never seen before. When the drummer yells, â€œgo!â€ it's my time to blow

And in between songs. I yell at the band, cause I don't care what they have to say. I'm not here to learn anything anyway. I'm here to dance. In the zone, in a trance

I don't smoke cigarettes, but if she's willing I'll drop my pants. Promiscuous I am, but I'm vegan, I don't eat ham or any of that stuff cause it's bad for you, right? Save the animals, forget the sweatshop scandals!

I do not shop at hot topic. I am not Mall Core, I am hardcore. Madball, Hatebreed, Throwdown, Terror. I own all their records on colored vinyl, limited edition and hand numbered. But you won't see me asking for no autograph. I ain't lookin' like no fool. I ain't no pop culture tool

If they ain't screamin', I ain't listenin'. If they ain't got a blast beat, I ain't tappin' my feet. I eat emo pansies for breakfast, and give their little t-shirts to my little sister. So cry about it you messenger bag, purse carrying whatever

I wear girl pants, but I'm homophobic. Yet the way I'm always huggin' on my homeboys you sure wouldn't know it. I've had my ears stretched an inch since back in '96. Somebody told me hardcore was a place to share what you believe, but I didn't like what dude said, so I flipped him off and told him to leave

I'm mad at society because my parents won't buy me a new computer, even though I asked politely. My playstation 2 is broken, but my Xbox works. When that breaks though, something will hit the fan and I'll express myself with rage and anger, just like a man. Cause that's how it's done, right? You get mad and start a fight, right? I think I may, I think I might, take my insecurities out on that punk in the pit tonight

Cause really, I am just insecure. More than that, I'm kinda scared and hurting inside. And I don't know how to deal with it. I don't know what being a man means. I thought acting tough was the way to go

But now that I think about it... I'm emo"

Some things never change here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care any more
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

I can feel you now

Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well is that really insanity
Or just a losers' game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time
Some things never change, here we go again

Why are you still crying?
Your pain is now through
Please, forget those teardrops
Let me take them from you
The love you are blessed with
This world's waiting for
So, let out your heart please, please
From behind that locked door

[Verse 2]
It's time we start smiling
What else should we do?
With only this short time
I'm gonna be here with you
And the tales you have taught me
From the things that you saw
Makes me want out your heart, please, please
From behind that locked door

And if ever my love goes
If I'm rich or I'm poor
Please, let out my heart, please, please
From behind that locked door

I think losing you took a part of my soul
The first person you truly love can cut the deepest, I know
I'm off the deep end and the water's going over my face
Feels like there's weights around my feet but I'm just walking in place
I wish that I could run from these emotions
I wish I found some comfort in the ones I hold the closest
Too certain feeling of uncertainty from what's below us
Or up above, its got me questioning each other's motives
Maybe I'm scared of watching life pass while constantly losing track of the time
Self-reflection is important to addrеss what's on my mind
But I don't understand why I can never lеave you behind
Why does everything remind me of when I could call you mine?
I feel selfish even speaking on this topic from the past
We forgive but can't forget, I always thought that this would last
Memories can tend to haunt us, watch this dust turn into ash
To disintegrate all our moments of our overshadowed past

[Chorus: Elijah Kyle]
I've been tryna lay low (Lay low)
But I'm sick of these emotions in my head
Overthinking way too much
And I can't stop this feeling of dread, it's exhausting
My head never stops
Yeah this baggage above me
[Verse 2: Elijah Kyle]
It's scary when you love someone so much that it's hard to breathe when they ain't with you
And even when they're really gone, you know they're always with you
Right inside your mental scrolling through previous memories
The Snapchats haunt you but you pretend that they're the enemy
Just knock it off, you know that you're lying to yourself
Love never truly dies, it's just dying out for help
Build a rose from the concrete, then watched it burn in flames
Went and threw away our plans just to leave me with this pain

[Chorus: Elijah Kyle]
I've been tryna lay low (Lay low)
But I'm sick of these emotions in my head
Overthinking way too much
And I can't stop this feeling of dread, it's exhausting
My head never stops
Yeah this baggage above me

[Outro: Apollo]
I'm sleeping until five, every day feels the same
Walking outside and the skies look grey
I don't wanna live if you ain't livin'
I don't wanna die if you ain't dyin'
I don't wanna tread, I want problems
I just wanna deal with 'em in silence"
8756,"""Shouting to the heavens or to anyone who will listen that the fix is in, that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shit-storm of all time.""

We shot the sky 40 times
And disappeared in freezing vapor
I could have been the parasite
Chewing holes in this life
You so cheaply passed on
Not so convenient to stand on
Crumbling cities or rejected
Water that you spit out
As sores begin to set in

Infected, rejected, neglected ejected
Infected, injected, rejected, neglected
Hold your breath, hold your breath

Breathe
Slowly the air
You burnt out
For your money
Twisted faces
Bent ghosts that
Tried to warn you
Of your behavior
Sickened with disease
Waste, waste, waste
Waste, wasted, wasted
So wasted, so wasted
So wasted, so wasted
So wasted, so wasted
So wasted, so wasted

Burned alive, taught to kill
Burned alive, taught to kill
Lost the will to live
I've lost the will to live
Simply lost the will to live
I’ve lost my will to live

""I myself, as many people well know, had basically embroiled myself into the dirty version of myself, I had taken the small amount of decay I did have, and I just built it, I let it grow: I wanted to become fully decayed in mind, soul, body, everything, I wanted to be darkness.""

Infected, rejected, injected ejected
Hold your breath, hold your breath
Just hold your breath..

Lying down, fornicate
Reaching this retarded state
On some lost thought that
Ripped at my heart
Ripping out forever
""- It was like my whole world was gone. I had to start all over
- You think you're going to Hell? If I would have to answer that truthfully, yes. I have always believed that. My mind was on only one mode, and that was to kill. So, I went forth to attack her and she through a scolding hot cup of coffee on me, uh which only increased my instincts, if you will, at which point in time, like I said, between thirty and sixty seconds I took her life. I believe it was five blows I took, trying to plunge the crow-bar into his heart."""

I've been driving through the mountains
As the sun beats on my cheeks
I haven't been back home
Or seen my girl in what feels like has been weeks
I just packed my bags
I locked my door
And I've come to miss my baby so
But this one town life isn't for me anymore

[Verse 2]
Now I sing my songs with pride
With a big smile on my face
My head's held high, my arms are wide, I've many dreams to chase
I don't miss my bed
I don't mind the cold
And I'll wish one day she'll come to stay, and I'll bring my baby with me on the road

[Verse 3]
And I walked through Carolina
And drove through Tennessee
I made my way through Texas, but that's not the place for me
I need open road
I need change of pace
And I drive all day and sing all night
If I'm with my girl I've come to find my place
[Verse 4]
Finally my baby's here beside me
I've made the longest journey home
I haven't checked the time or gotten up, I don't care to check my phone
I've got all I want
I've got all I need
Her eyes are closed, her skin is warm, and she's sleeping peacefully

[Outro]
I can't think about the after
My darling's here with me
I can finally sleep and close the book
And ever live together happily
My lips are shut
There's nothing more to say
One day I'll settle down, I promise you
I've done my part
I've come back home to stay"

If you don't feel the same way that I feel, girl it's not your fault

So you've been acting strange, girl there's been a change
In the way you walk, the way you talk it's everything
I would say hello, and you'd usually say ""hey baby how you been, how was your day?""
But now it ain't the same, you calling me by my first name
The only answers I if from you was okay
Tell me to my face, are we okay? or are you done with me do you wanna walk away?

Kids going to school.
People off to work.
The hustle and bustle
of life passing by.

People joined by
hearts, hands, and voices.
Lives intertwined
one with another.

Not knowing what today brings.
Sometimes taken for granted.
If I'd only known
I'd tried harder.

My broken heart bleeds.
Nothing can mend it.
Just a fool to believe
I've anything to offer.
Life as it was
now changed forever.
Never to be the same.
Lives left shattered.

A family no more.
Each gone separate ways.
Occassionally paths cross
as if all strangers.

No unity.
No harmony.
Just uneasiness
and uncertainity.

A beautiful sunset.
Soft pink and red glow.
Bidding all good night.

Buyin everythin' when I be goin' to the shop
Move to a new house every week
I ain’t hittin twice, unless she a freak
She gon pop it out, I don’t even speak
Keep it to myself, but they want a peek
[Pre-Chorus: Khaos Official]
Like hey
Wait
Got nothin' to say
I don’t worry ‘bout the cash I make it every day
I don’t play
Wait
Never go away
Imma always stay cause

[Chorus: Khaos Official]
Everybody knowin' that my spliff better
Fifth letter
Imma always drip better
Miss when the crib hella stacked
I’m a drip seller
Go getta
Flow better
Imma wear a gold sweater
Phone better
Bone better
Call myself a throne getter

[Verse 2: BrocK]
Creepin for a minute
Main girl a bit weird
Startin' to get suspicious
Feel like the love is shiftin
Ain’t no communication
Every night your waitin
Ain’t comin home til the early morn’
When you hit my phone I’m takin
Started retarded, I’m high as a martian
Your girl in my Target, I eat up a carpet
I’m sick as Ebola, I’m barfin' on beat
Bombarded with booty, she park it on me
Mind on the money in my hand, a machine-gun
I got that dope for the low if you need some
Your girl give me brain on the molly, she geekin'
Take your money and buy new car like the deekin
Pull up, you shook up
She virgin, I took her
She said we should hook up
Her boyfriend a booger
Don’t know me? Then look up, I be in the clouds
Pool full of Henny, I drink and I drown
Trippin, I’m crashin'
On shroomies, on acid
She got a ass so fat you throw it back girl imma catch it
Yeah, I’m deep in the streets like I’m stuck in the pavement
Go deep in your lady, her coochie not vacant
I need it, I take it, I’m rapin' your pockets
They say “Fuck the law” when I’m placed in court dockets, I’m cray!
[Pre-Chorus: Khaos Official]
Wait
Got nothin' to say
I don’t worry ‘bout the cash I make it every day
I don’t play
Wait
Never go away
Imma always stay cause

We open our eyes
When we open our eyes and dream
We open our eyes

Under normal we change the wind
Facing every direction
Planted in the future, we live two lives
All to reveal a secret we can't hide

When we open our eyes and dream
We open our eyes
When we open our eyes and dream
We open our eyes

We search the sky, planets chasing the stars
Pulling towards deep affection
Weights and numbers measure a wound that won't heal
All to reveal a secret we can't hide

When we open our eyes and dream

When we open our eyes and dream

My Life, My life, My life
Yeah nikka, this is My Life
My Life, My life, My Life
We out'chea, we living our lives

[Verse 1: Prelice]

Fuck it I'm MVK, tune in my blood
I live in a jungle, I'm a bear
I got a pair of sneakers I never get to wear
Man, my life so fucked up that's why I never share
Man I'm so nasty, never call me Nasty C
'Cause my name don't even contain just a *C*
I blind-fold you, so that you can never see
And I take your heart out and throw it in tha' sea
Man I wan' be a DJ like DJ SLIQUE
I wan' bring justice like The Justice League
I wonder why I can't stop demolishing these bitches
That's why I can't stop accomplishing this missions
I'm so high right now, I can't even feel tha sky
And I don't even need a spy
YEAH!
'Cause I don't even possess a tie
When I wear those Jordans they say I'm 'LIKE MIKE'
[Hook]

My Life My life My life
Yeah nikka, this is My Life

All I wan' do, is dive
My Life, My life, My life
Yeah nikka, this is My Life
My Life, My life, My Life
We out'chea, we living our lives

[Verse 2: MC Pyz]

I stipulated my immunity, I bring global calabity
Standing behind the mic, I ejaculate these fatal brutal bars
Haters keep on hating but beware I invested in winning
I've been pregnant for a long time, so this is time to cause mental destruction
I've been pregnant with mature lines, giving birth to them will be causing life ambitions
Don't get in contact with my lines 'cause you'll get paralatic contamination
I've been living  in this world nikka
My punchlines are so robust like steel
Bitch you can't even steal them
Ah! This is MC Pyz don't get in contact with my lines
'cause you'll get paralatic contamination

[Hook *2]
My Life My life My life
Yeah nikka, this is My Life
My Life, My life, My Life
All I wan' do, is dive
My Life, My life, My life
Yeah nikka, this is My Life

We out'chea, we living our lives"

Mirrors reflect only what we expect
Just what we wanna see
Clothes looking fresh: cotton, rayon, and mesh
Household warm and germ-free

[Chorus]
I filled up a jar with colorful capsules, jewelry, and rings
Notice how we constantly thrive on excellent things

[Verse 2]
Came here to stay, incarnated I sway
Toward material needs
Television hums, busy hand pounds and strums
Two or three knuckles bleed

[Chorus]
Boats and trains and commercial flight airplanes that whistle and sing
See how we persistently thrive on excellent things"

Caressed the trees, tenderly
The trembling trees
Embraced the breeze, tenderly
Then you and I
Came wandering by
And lost in a sigh
Were we
The shore was kissed
By sea and mist, tenderly
I can't forget
How two hearts met
Breathlessly
Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly
Your arms opened wide
And closed me inside
You took my lips
You took my love
So tenderly"

I spent these waking hours
Looking for the sandman
I spent these waking hours
Looking for his master plan
I’ll wait ‘til morning ‘til he comes to my house
And he’ll give no warning
When he’s knocking me out

So sing me to sleep tonight
And don’t bring me back to life

I spend these waking hours
Looking for the sandman
I spend these waking hours
Looking for his master plan
He will be sorry when he comes to my house
I’ll show no mercy ‘til the lights go out

So sing me to sleep tonight
And don’t bring me back to life
We’re waiting for the sandman
But he never hears the call
We’re waiting for the sandman
But he never hears the call
We’re waiting for the sandman
But he never hears the call
We’re waiting for the sandman

9122,"If I was the son of God
I'd live alone nude in the wilderness
The animals would speak to me
And approach me without hesitation
The birds would sing to scarecrows
In circadian rhythm
Inside the garden of desperation
A voice could be heard

And all the plastic politician devils cry
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground
Whatever happened to a quiet simple life?
Innocence is lost as we near our final day

Deep in the forest
The apparitions are all in attendance
Phantoms and specters
Converge in silence under the moonlight
Behind this illusion
Is a union of theanthropism
Inside the garden of desperation
A voice could be heard
And all the plastic politician devils cry
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground
Whatever happened to a quiet simple life?
Innocence is lost as we near our final day

Falling bombs on Babylon
What a perfect ending to it all
Falling bombs on Babylon
What a perfect ending to it all

And all the plastic politician devils cry
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground
Whatever happened to a quiet simple life?
Innocence is lost as we near our final
Innocence is lost as we near our final day"

DC, Maryland, Virginia stand up
XO, Wale

[Verse 1: Uptown XO]
Georgetown shopping, Uptown grinding
Southside riders, funel easy widers
Funny people find us, funny but outside us
Feel safer when they outside of the climate
Raised in a hostile environment, got wild and violent
Almost got shot, silenced
That's when I was riding with the heat
The man that shot was on the other side of the street
Didn't wanna tell mom then, I was grinding my teeth
My soul had questions, got advice from the streets
And my advice was to eat
But I miss those days, cause the prices was cheap
Back then black Timbs made my cypher complete
Those days were so great, priceless to me
Glad to be alive in the bar like ""no ice in that, please""
About to make a toast to life but I can die when I leave

If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride then we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)

[Verse 2: Wale]
And I'mma ride 'til the wheels ain't wheels, and your own
Tend to keep my heels on they heels, I fear no
Evil near me, never ever, we so clear from the negative
My Jesus emblem has a double meaning
Positively I proceed with caution
DC good with them [mad gum?] flosses
Brothers on papers and others got warrants
And the radio ignore the local runt reporters
The bulk of our reporters
Don't ever leave the hood like the crooked cops that want us
Look around where you walk to the District
Where a hater hate a nigga, nigga this is nothing normal
Victor and Jamaal, XO or Folarin
The north left side venturin' off Georgia
Mention my name, his soul meet the lord
His corpse meet the morgue
Get the tank on fool, we can ride

Ridin' and smokin niggas for rollers that's rollin'
God gave me dice, I shook 'em up, rolled them
Devil's still datin', Po-Po patrollin'

Express through whatever I wrote, and you can quote him
That uptown soldier boy'a Super Soak them
Rap Superman, they superficial
Gotta trust to your G's
We too official, the newer issue
Peep the cover, go through the pages, rippin' stages
What I did on the block used to be my résumé
Learned as I aged, God is my agent
Of course they want my corpse in a sport we playin' in
Made the bed, we gotta lay in it
And I'm ridin' on a road hotel, Holiday Inn
Away from home, but home is where the heart is
I'm never heartless, a real nigga roadtrip

4679,"It's been a long way for that star
Now rising in our skies:
Its light has trekked a thousand years
To reach our earthborn eyes.

It may have long ago burned out
Amid the blue of space
Yet only now its ray has come
To set our sights ablaze.

That icon of a perished star
Climbs heaven's canopy:
We who saw not the light that was
Now see what's ceased to be.

It's ever thus when our desires
Go, spent, into the night.
Our love still follows after us
With an extinguished light."
3912,"Atop the crags and cliffs the air is thin
So we'll find a mountain path on down the hill
Meet me where the snowmelts flows
It is there, my dear, where we'll begin again
Skipping stones, braiding hair
Last years antlers mark the trail

Take us back, Oh! take us back, Oh! take us: Take us back!
Take us back, Oh! take us back, Oh! take us: Take us back!

I've a friend who lives out by the rivers mouth
He knows the fiddle's cry is an old sound
A lonesome bow, the creaks and moans of empty houses
Are songs like falling rain
Wind blown buildings, muddy ground
The strength of water can sink a man

Take us back, Oh! take us back, Oh! take us: Take us back!
Take us back, Oh! take us back, Oh! take us: Take us back!

When the higher hills have turned to blue
And the waves are lapping where the children grew
All that we have known will be an echo
Of days when love was true
Muted voices, just beyond
The silent surface of what has gone"

Wasn't lookin' for a new love with my heart still achin'
Tryin' to make sense of the love I'd lost
But when the whiskey started workin' guess I stopped thinkin'

(That's why they say)
Friends don't let friends drink and fall in love

Now I'm wakin' up to someone I don't barely know
Thought I was in love last night - the whiskey told me so

Well you left me in that barroom drunk and flirtin'
And though you were only tryin' to cheer me up
Next time stop me from lovin' so lonely and hurtin'

Check in with your homemade bar set
Set down all your bags at the door
So we can make a toast to the thing that you're here for
Sunset painting strips down the skyline
Warm blood turns your cheeks into red wine
Sober enough to get you back out the door
Let's make another toast to the thing that you're here for

We're a byproduct of the internet age
And I can't begin to tell you where we're coming from
Oh, we're self aware, we yearn for simpler days
I don't know where it started but for now I'm glad to be here

Well based on all our current projections
You're on course to leave unsatisfied
So we here have assembled a task force
To forcibly reroute your flight
Now since we're flying real close to the sun
Your wax and wings may come undone
A necessary risk to reach that obelisk
We know you're fine with this
So please unclench your jaw and put this in your mouth
It's all you need to get that easy clout
Your dopamine receptors have been begging you
For quite some time
Of course this all may be for naught
There's plenty of things we still forgot
We'll work you til you're sore, half naked on the floor
And you'll find the thing that you're here for

We're a byproduct of the internet age
And I can't begin to tell you where we're coming from
Oh, we're self aware, we yearn for simpler days
I don't know where it started but for now I'm glad to be here

My sex toys got checked out by TSA
But I'm probably fine (It doesn't even matter)
My next connecting flight just got delayed
But I really don't mind (Why do I even bother)
I guess my hotel overbooked my stay
But I think I'll be fine (No good can come from anger)
I got blackout drunk before I came
But that's how I get by (I can't stay any longer)

I'm a wreck
No you don't need another song to justify another dance with me
You just need to push through and keep your wits in check
We'll fight the hangover tomorrow but for now we're alright
I will probably regret this but I don't really care
You can pack up all your things and leave for all I care
'Cause I got a mouth to feed and a couple of options I'd like to try tonight
Though I know I'm not the first to say it man
Ain't this a weird time to be alive

Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa
Ooh, whoa"
4953,"I can't believe I can pass
On this path
And go beyond a state of anger

Far away from past rage crisis
I am now controlled by an unknown feeling of hate

Paroxysmic rage
My heart pumps nitroglycerine
Encountement of a state of anger
Deliverance of inner emotions
For the realization of your salvation
Oh the one I hate
Feel the atrocities of this paroxysm

Now lead by a strong instinct
Loss of physical control
Everything seems slowler
Every sense increases
Nothing exists except you
And all the pain you carry
The feeling is now so intense, so complete
Tears of rage flow through my eyes
Through my veins, through my soul
Convulsions of adrenaline hits my body
Bow to me!

I am now controlled by this paroxysmic rage

Paroxysmic rage, never again
The end is so tragic, so sadistic, so magic
Paroxysmic rage, give me the hate to close your fate
Paroxysmic hate, make me end my liberty"

So I looked deep, I looked deep inside my own mind and its only to find
That I dont care, cause I'm sitting here and not there, yet I see its not fair"
1679,"[Verse 1]
When everything that moves and breaks
Everything just starts to ache
Yeah, you'll never know, you'll never wait
I think that the world is fake
Moving hips, you'll never learn
Just how much you made this hurt
Idiot, you'll never speak
That's why you took a part of me

I had it all, I can't win
It's the only thing that I need
I'm sinking under my skin
It's the only way I'll win

[Verse 2]
If I ever let you go
Got no air, I'm gonna choke
Idiot, you'll never try
Sometimes I think the world's a lie
Take a hint, you'll never learn
Just how much you made this hurt
Idiot, you made me rhyme
I think about you all the time

I heard it all, I can't win
It's the only thing that I need
I'm sinking under my skin
It's the only way I'll win

You take control, you hurt my skin

9285,"MY LIFE STORY BY Ywn Mo Buckets

Tables turn, bridges burn,I lived and learned, to respect each other

In old days they had a saying wherever you go check yo back

When I was 11 I lost my father yea it was a bad day but I pushed through it that's the way how you go through the grieving process you gotta learn how to handle it take it like a man.Think about how he wanted you to handle your life

No bad thing is a good thing when I lost my father I lost my sanity I couldn't control myself on what I was doing with my actions
Moms said everything is going to be okay just be yourself and always
Be the Same

It got to the point where I ran away to Brockton I was emotional I didn't know what I was doing. Went to the hospital got checked in for having suicidal thoughts,1 week later went into a Family Italian home

4 days later I went back home to enjoy my life but i didn't change one thing around. About a couple months later I was put on focusing pills to control myself on what the priority was in my life.which was to stay focused and be happy I still have that one parent that's still in my life"
5071,"The clock struck midnight
The boy was sleeping tight but in the half light one girl spies
Lurking in shadows she plans to steal his eyes
She ripped them out and hid then cried herself to sleep

He woke up screaming, felt an excruciating pain
He felt his face and almost fainted when he found his eyes weren’t there
‘Hey, wake up! Wake up! I must be sleeping now. Hey, wake up! Wake up! Cause something is very wrong… What the fuck is gong on?’

At night, away from streetlights she waits for the time to sneak inside and steal their eyes, to leave them blind, deprive them of their sight
She leaves some thread, a needle and two buttons for them to sew on their face

‘Hey, wake up! Wake up! The room’s filling with water. I gotta stop crying right now or else we’re gonna drown

Now treading water she couldn’t stop her eyes and the blind boy stood there scared. Now neck-deep waiting for the end to come when the wardrobe swallowed both

At night, away from streetlights she waits for the time to sneak inside and steal their eyes, to leave them blind, deprive them of their sight
She leaves some thread, a needle and two buttons for them to sew on their face

She made him just like her
Just like they did…Just like they did
At night, away from streetlights she waits for the time to sneak inside and steal their eyes, to leave them blind, deprive them of their sight
She leaves some thread, a needle and two buttons for them to sew on their face

The wardrobe tossed them into the sea. The boy tried to hold on to her. She got him to let go and freed herself"

In the back of mine, there is no kindness
Only lies as you'll discover

I can't be trusted
I won't be true

Anyone will tell you

And all the while, you want me with you
Want me with you everywhere
Can't you see what's wrong with me?
I'm only with you when I'm there

I can't be trusted
I'm telling you for free

Girl this stuff is ugly
Come right here and love me
Put your cell phone down and don’t put nothing above me
Accept your sexy body, cause I know you wanna touch me
Asking all these questions, he don’t have his license, does he?
Age is just a number, and summer's just a season
See your knees so weak and you don’t even have a reason
Well girl we’ll stop that shaking
Wait until the evening and I'll really give you something to believe in
Girl why are you grieving
Give you a new meaning
Get right in between those precious things that’s in your jeans
Girl how would you know? We’re only teens
Love is something that we only knowing in our dreams
All I really know that baby girl is that it seems
Like we’re having lots of fun and that we make a perfect team
Touching on your body, girl you acting like a fiend
I'mma be your bestest friend that satisfies all of your needs
So just love me like you do

I'm here to give you what you need
I can I can give you give you give you what you need
We can walk the park or we can climb up in some trees
Sit you in the shade while we listen to the breeze
Or I'll take you to the movies where they got reclining seats
Or we can take the car to your apartment up the street
If you want to get it started cause my heart is what you need
And it's really up to you there baby girl and that’s for me
Put my hand up on your waist and let you take the lead
As long as I ain't free, as long as I can breathe
As long as you are you, and I can just be me
And when we come together it's like we drowning in some seas
Girl we 'bout to make it happen like you just wouldn't believe
All the stuff that you could lose and you can gain
Girl you got me crazy when you whispering my name
So come right over here and let make you go insane
And I hope you fall in love with all this stuff that I be saying
Girl just love me like you do

All I would ask...
Is you complete your only task
Try to make this last

She left me in my misery
Without her, what should I do?
How should I feel?

She’s left me in my mundane life
She’s becoming absent from my memory
I don’t wanna lose that memory
That memory that stings

And all this has made me think
Do I deserve all that’s come to me?
I know they had a thing for me
But that was the past
So why did they leave me
Oh, why did they leave me alone?

She was there
She used to care
The thoughts of her always crowded my head
It was time for me to get over it
Let her go, she was never worth my time
Let her be absent
And I will not notice
Let me forget about her
For heaven’s sake, let me forget about her already"

And I'd crow all day

They wouldn't understand with the shit that I got, you got some shit to say?

Don't have to suffer anymore
I'm relaxing, made a mixtape, then an album
I don't care if I get placed or my shit hits platinum
Said it loud and clear, I made this year my best yet

Another wasted night
Another failed attempt to fix things
You’re out of your mind
Another fight’s begun
Once again we’re stuck in this damn
Never-ending hatred you’ve won
Or so you tell yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget it, it’s over
It’s not worth it
I’m sick of this
You said it yourself
Things won’t get better
‘cause you won’t listen
I’m not fighting this war
If you continue trying to lose
You don’t need a leader
You can pick your own damn path to choose
[Chorus]
You can’t grow up
I think you’re stuck
The world you’ve built is falling apart
Stop trying to hide
I know what’s inside
I’m not your enemy
So please stop fighting me

[Verse 2]
You say you’re in the right
Say that it’s my fault that
Things are how they are now
It’s useless arguing
Blame us for everything
‘cause you can do no wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Forget it, it’s over
It’s not worth it
I’m sick of this
You said it yourself
Things won’t get better
‘cause you won’t listen
I’m not fighting this war
If you continue trying to lose
You don’t need a leader
You can pick your own damn path to choose
[Chorus]
You can’t grow up
I think you’re stuck
The world you’ve built is falling apart
Stop trying to hide
I know what’s inside
I’m not your enemy
So please stop fighting me

[Verse 3]
Don’t build this wall
We both know you’ll fall
And the way that things are going
No one will catch you
Push me away
‘Cause you can’t hear me say
It’s no one's fault
You just can’t get your way

[Chorus]
You can’t grow up
I think you’re stuck
The world you’ve built is falling apart
Stop trying to hide
I know what’s inside
I’m not your enemy

No disrespect though I disconnect
I seem distant cause they seeing my side
Like I don’t side with them
Even though I’m on the side with them
I ain’t decide with them
So why should I ride with them
Another victim of deceit deceased
I’d rather live then rest in piece
Some bleed
I can’t believe I watched them leave as they roll up their sleeves
Some parish as parents grieve
The kids naive to the truth
If you ever need a hero should you look to the troops?
With them gone its kid of hard to regroup
I watch the news like when will they come home?
The years just seem so long and the still carry on

We bare the weight of the world
Now that’s a heavy load
Sometimes war is necessary
The pressure varies
It’s scary
Though they still March
Through the desert do they feel parched?
They play their part loosing limbs
And different body parts
I’m reminiscing can’t remember what made it start
I think they played on my emotions they know I got a heart
It’s hard not to feel when your people are getting killed
It’s like they sent us to war but didn’t give us a shield
We’ll be fighting until there is no blood to spill
I know they’ll march on
Lord I wish they’d stand still

It’s left to the citizens
To support the troops they’re sending in
They tell us we must win
But how have we won when we’re always losing friends?
I can’t pretend this issue ain’t up under my skin
These politicians keep lying
If I don’t buy it then they take it from my taxes
And act as if my freedoms a gift
So now I got to fight for the freedom I get
You better be I’m patriotic like Belichec
Its evident my moneys better spent
In the land of the free
In the home of the brave
If I’m digging a hole I’m just glad it’s not a grave

Paws and mandibles, to our surprise, come blooming out
Muzzles and secretions intertwined
With wrappers and garbage
Fifty dead dogs strewn about
You had the power of steel. You had the power of weight
To build a pit, to use fear as bait
Human infliction and the four stages of cruelty
They're my machines with no souls
I can hear them whimpering over the sneering laughter
The collar placed around my throat
A dominant leather reminder
Gutted. Classified as property
I must obey, or I will be broken
Frozen. No justice. Cryptic. No salvation
The ghosts will find you by other means
One day soon, you'll be thrown in a pit
Deemed destroyed. Just for the rush of it"

And I put tattoo teardrops on all the dead bodie's faces

To get it goin' from zero to fuckin' totally insane

I’ve been in practise, mеditations and ministrations
Still disappointed, but I’ve accepted the fate
The only way in is through the booby trapped door
Still you want more, how many of you have been paying up
My geez been at it, ripping microphones and stages
Now you lock us up in cages saying we need the exposure
They been sleeping at their momma house with a couple albums out
This the situation that you put me in
Nowadays I’ve been feeling like a hero
The Dark Knight and Joker working on a killer joke
God on the phone again, He telling me to step up

Supernatural
All powerful
Hold on to His promises
And we can all be heroes
Surrender all
You’re in control
We will come out as gold
And we can all be heroes

Verse 2
She laid on the couch tryna chase the teargas away
Im tryna find a way to send a word of encouragement
The city fathers tryna discipline every vendor
All she wanted was a couple bucks for the offering basket
Telling her to move is the same as starvation
She been sending all of her kids to school with tomatoes
It was her avenue until we populated her space
Only God knows when it will be normal again
Everybody walking with pain, I’m tryna share hope
But nonetheless we all Black Widow
Ain’t no politician Downey, so we settle for Robert
The chances are less that we all love the revolution
Its evolution, my faith gotta step up and pick the hammer
I need the lightning too but this is at a cost
Already told myself that I wasn’t worthy
But the scriptures still whisper the streets need a hero

Verse 3
It is hard to pay attention when they feed from your pocket
Picking different flows, making sure the tracks are buttercup
I need the power puff but they having bubbles in my cup
He watches over us even though I struggle with this dust
It ain’t enough – I gotta get to my moment of truth
The cape I been wearing’s a figment of my thoughts
So I quote from the greats at times (at times)
Every time that I proceed, they come and change the needs
Really shifty this life is at times (at times)
It’s me, myself and these rhymes at times (at times)
So we gotta prepare, our work has no vacation
The implementation of your dream comes at a cost
Pardon the efforts my guy – my CV needs no hoodies
I been in the hi-hats before y’all started rapping
Now I talk about Christ and the struggles I still face
When you see me winning, put this on repeat
Hook (SoulDeep)
Supernatural
All powerful
Hold on to His promises
And we can all be heroes
Surrender all
You’re in control
We will come out as gold
And we can all be heroes

Outro (SoulDeep)
One mission
One God
One truth
Yeah we can all be heroes
No conformity
No insecurity
Faith like a mustard seed
Yeah you can be a hero"

I'm wide awake in the middle of the night
Cursed to be a [?] man
Talk to me
You know we've got the world in the palm of our hands

If you want love around you
Then let go
It's all we can do
If you want love but you can't get enough
I'll give you what you want

Here we are, living up the promised land
We took a hand and counted deep into the night
I got you eating out the palm of my hand

If you want love around you
Then let go
It's all we can do
If you want love but you can't get enough

If you want love but you can't get enough

Gonna go some place far
And escape to paradise
Sometimes life feels like one big race
Catchin’ up to time and space
It’s as if we’re always walkin’
At the same pace
And I don’t know what to do
But I can’t stop thinkin’ about you
Time after time again
Like a dead end

Do I have somebody or am I all alone?
Used to have the world, now no one dials up the phone
I was on the summit of the mountain I had climbed
Now it's looking like this the hill I'll die on
I had so much faith, so I wonder where it's gone
I can't pray, so I'm writing You a song
All of my mistakes, by the grace of my God
They been thrown away, why's my vibe feeling off?

[Chorus]
I just gotta wonder
Ship is going under
Prone in the covers, I'm
Thinking 'bout the summer
I had to be cutthroat
Cut off to the utmost
I know if I let go
I know I'll be done for

[Verse 2]
God forgives, I don't forget
Found out, surprised that I slept
I'm the prodigal, I wonder what's nеxt
Jehovah watching me and I know that He wеpt
Good God, my soul like an anchor, no lie
My guys said, ""Stop thinking 'bout it,"" I've tried
By this time, I just can't hide
Oh my my, I'll drown in my pride
[Chorus]
I just gotta wonder
Ship is going under
Prone in the covers, I'm
Thinking 'bout the summer
I had to be cutthroat
Cut off to the utmost
I know if I let go
I know I'll be done for

[Verse 3]
Read on your Bible and say your prayers, go to church
Man, I done tried everything but I still feel hurt
I'm King David in my grief, torn shirts
And I don't mean to offend, but can God still work?
Lost in the world, can You still find me?
My heart a safari, goodness
My mind sloppy, time rotting
I'm jotting my thoughts
While the ink blotting
I'm a carbon copy of the Psalmist
Sounding the alarms, never thought I was alarmist
I had the world, I wanted more
I'm sole to blame, I opened the door
I asked for knowledge, God gave me pain
I asked for light, I got the rain
I saw the flowers, now I cower
I was dominating, I'm devoured
[Verse 4: Not sure]
I ain't really feeling the energy in the room
Every time I come around you brush me off just like a broom
You treat me like trash, what am I to you, a broom?
I got dark circles around my eyes 'cause of you
I told you shit you shoulda took to the tomb
But told everyone and said ""Are we still cool?""
Enough of that shit, I'm through with you
I'm leaving right now bitch, keep my jewels
And thanks for turning my screws
'Cause you gave me inspiration to write these new age blues"
1945,"[Verse 1]
I had a lot of doubts and I asked
The questions that's on your mind
We're left so blank and no answers
And please, I asked you, please
And now I stand here before you
Without a chance or a pride
I'm begging you to just let go
And let me have you

[Pre-Chorus]
Eating out the palm of my hands
You hide it
Even though you want even more
And why is that you never care
It'll always be only you I adore
'Cause baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I forgot to kiss you
But I can't forget how I'm mesmerized
Every second, your eyes in my eyes
And why do I constantly miss you?
'Cause I'm not scared, I'm terrified
And when the truth ends, you deserve goodbye
[Verse 2]
I know you never bothered or touched upon
To shallow the pain till it's gone, it's gone
And all that I swore was for nothing
So, ""Be strong, move on, move on""
And this is the last song I'll write you
I poison my name and you try, you try
To see me more than just selfish
And forget, I pray, forget but one day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll be eating out the palm of your hands
I'll hide it
But you'll know I'm wanting more
I hope I'll stay sleepless at night
As it haunts me, it was you I ignored
'Cause baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I forgot to kiss you
But I can't forget how I'm mesmerized
Every second, your eyes in my eyes
And why do I constantly miss you
'Cause I'm not scared, I'm terrified
And when the truth ends, you deserve goodbye
[Bridge]
'Cause I'm here, and I'm gone, I'm gone again
And you're here, and you're gone, yeah, you're gone again
I swear that it's right, ""It's wrong,"" you said
And all of our trust, yes, it's gone again
I fall to my knees just to try, and I try again
And I scream it aloud, ""Come, come back to me""
And it's right, please, it's right
""But it's wrong,"" you said
And I sing it aloud, ""Choose and make it me""

[Chorus]
'Cause I forgot to kiss you
(I fall to my knees just to try, and I try again)
But I can't forget how I'm mesmerized
(And I scream it aloud, ""Come, come back to me"")
Every second, your eyes in my eyes
(And it's right, please, it's right, ""But it's wrong,"" you said)
(And I sing it aloud, ""Choose and make it me"")
And why do I constantly miss you
'Cause I'm not scared, I'm terrified
And when the truth ends, it's me who's black inside"

A blade cut my tongue, when will I play again?
In my garden, without shedding my own blood
Blood explodes through my grave's loam
When flesh is suffering and suffering is my flesh
Sensual decay of my body

And life, a theater of pain
And life, to love, to die
And life, for the savour of tears

No discretion in my prayers, my passion nailed to a black cross
Sister death knocks on my door for the last rites
A torment as a temptation, my body tied up by putrefaction
Resurrection in blood, for the next holy day
And life, as a radiance of pain
And life, to die and love again
And life to die and love until the Sunday
And life, for the savour of tears
And life !
For the savour of tears
Blood gets down on our grave's loam
A blade cuts our tongues and our fingers
Resurrection in blood for the next holy day"

Aye, pass me that lighter
Come and vibe out in the villa with me
Fuck what a hater say, I’ma always look away

[Verse 1]
My mama always said
“If you keep doin’ shit, then shit’ll get done”
But niggas rather sit around and twiddle they thumbs
Main reason I can’t fuck with you bums
The whole squad in gear
This year, we’ll double incomes
And stay fresh like Double Mint gum
Sippin’ bubble tea, smokin’ Bubba Kush
For a small fee, I can get it by the bush
Yeah, I’m clockin’ digits, but I play it subtle
You should’ve paid attention, now you payin’ double
A nigga out here flippin’ like Simone Biles
When it come to spinach, keep a strong pile
When it come to bitches, keep a long file
I tell her, “Meet up at Wish, I got my own aisle”
Better be at least a [...] ‘fore that phone dial
Before a nigga cop, I got a whole tryouts
Might break a pound down and just gram it out
You worry ‘bout fittin’ in, while I’m standin’ out
I made with a way with no one handin’ out
Had to do it
Well, that was easy
[Chorus]
Had to do it
A nigga had to make a way
Had to do it
Nobody gonna plan it for you
So, a nigga had to make a way
Had to do it
Nobody gonna hand it to you
9-5 lunchbreak, I was makin’ plays
Don’t let ‘em see me hand it to you
A nigga had to make a way
Had to do it
I swear, all I do is hustle

[Verse 2]
Why you standin’ in the way, instead of makin’ one?
They ain’t gonna hand it to you, what you waitin’ on?
My Uncle Nick told me to make it happen
Plus, you got to pack, if you don’t make it rappin’
Make sure you’re doin’ what you love and keep that paper stackin’
If you not lovin’ what you’re doin’, why you even at it?
Take a moment, let that set in
No excuses, lil’ nigga
You should’ve been got your hustle up
Every turn I took was like a dead end
Until my DIGI scale became my best-friend
Now, the owner greet me when I step in
Dry martini ‘fore they seat me, twist a lemon
I remember grindin’ for some newer Nike’s
Now, I struggle pickin’ out a pair before the flight leave
Really nothin’ new, it’s how we do it nightly
Had to do it
[Chorus]
Had to do it
A nigga had to make a way
Had to do it
Nobody gonna plan it for you
So, a nigga had to make a way
Had to do it
Nobody gonna hand it to you
9-5 lunchbreak, I was makin’ plays
Don’t let ‘em see me hand it to you
A nigga had to make a way
Had to do it"

I'm buckin’ wild like the AK 'cause it came from KAYTRA
I point it down so you can't escape her
Even if you duck, duck goose neck, your Canada Goose wet
Barred up from your boots to your crewneck
This that blue flame, put the green to this shit, this that blue dream
Put your schemes to the test in real life, bet you need a vest, bet you need a vet
Niggas bitin’ crazy, already seen a death by rabies
Niggas gettin' lazy diggin' holes and pushin' daisies
Boonk actin' like it's gravy lookin' crazy on the internet
Niggas dirty dancin', no Patrick Swayze
Lover don’t get caught on your Savion Glover for these white boys
They out here cancellin’ plans at the last minute
You'll deny it then admit it
That type mad different, but I ain’t mad, I'm high as a kite
Trippin' supplyin' the light, niggas can’t buy this advice, listen
Caution with questionin' shit niggas that claim you bitchin'
Get straight to the money whenever your hand start itchin'
Know that if you Rodman you'll never be Mike or Pippen
And you gotta know that ain't me dissin', dodgin' smoke screens
That ain't the Piff in the air or nigga smokin' different
Could read the same bible but niggas quote it different
They finna do clean water just like Prohibition
Already know the mission, why they keep on missin', we grow more efficient

Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded

Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)

Ay yo these niggas mad thirsty for the fame and glory
You's as basic as a baby daddy on Maury
Fuck your fake chain blingin', autotune singin'
I'm a killer bee straight out the hive and I'm stingin'
Dirty sling Doctor, botox your girls lips up
We soul trainin' 'em like Don Cornell, get your dick sucked
We fist fuckin' the money, we runnin' down jewelers
We flooded backstage out like ice in the coolers
Fuck the rulers, Donald Trump is a piece of shit
I got 36 chambers, hollow tip in the clip
Smoke a dick, no time for the games and dramatics
We blessed every morning with today's mathematics
Put a hole in your cabbage, quick to fuck up your party
Off your whole set nigga, you can ask Cardi
We used to lose our cracks and we was runnin' from the narcies
Now we watchin' Shark Tank, rolls up in the marquees
[Chorus: Mick Jenkins]
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded
I never had it, gotta get the free gotta have it (gotta have it)
Gotta have it, please excuse the water bottle habit
Finger spazzin', make a nigga think this semi fully automatic
Fuck the dramatics, we get through them locks when they padded

Fuck the pain you were hotter than a flame
It's a shame it's okay
Got me living on the edge
Was the closest thing to death
It's way harder to forget
I'm a man I have my pride
I let it slide down my throat
Oh my Ghaaad Oh my Ghaaad
Fuck your man I hit it first
All the curves I know the drill
Lick the labia til it drip
Pussy murder 6 feet deep
No loose change cause I like the grip
Thought that I've found the one for keeps
She a bitch and a bitch and a hoe
Oh my Ghaaad bitch
Bitch you got a price to pay
You and I we don't relate
Watch me while I elevate Mary J' animé
I'm ready to change the time Ella Mai
I'm not boo'd up cause I freak out I don't trust them hoes

1056,"And the spectre keeps on haunting you somehow
If it’s transcendence you seek, well then, that’s not allowed
You think the new humans decreed a 40 hour work week?
If you can’t bear it, then, don’t let them make you feel weak

And so i sweat

And the spectre keeps on chasing you from behind
They keep on gnashing their teeth
You’re running empty, boy--you better make up your mind
Before they eat you alive. before they eat you alive

And so i sweat

Took a walk down to the cemetery depths
When i turn off my mind it makes it easy to connect
I started breaking all the plates up in the restaurant
I can’t sweat anymore, i can’t sweat anymore

Another generation, another burning reason
Another generation, another crop to yield in
Another generation, another burning reason
Another generation, a bit more desperation
Another generation, another burning reason
Another generation, soil for blood this season"

You're a drugged leech
Gave Courage to change
Yet You stay the same
Wisdom to see the difference
You're Full of resistance
I'll relieve your anxiety
By removing you from society

Take back?
It was never yours
This life you're leading, is death for sure
You're 21 and now it's time
To take back what's rightfully mine

You can see I want this life to end
I will bleed until my heart is dead

Black blinds cover the glass
In a room with my past
Table littered with the drugs I need
Neglected my Child's need to feed
Remove the blinds to reveal the sun
Pearsing light shines through my soul
To reveal my child stiff and cold
Death for me is sure to come
Take back?
It was never yours
This life you're leading, is death for sure
You're 27 and now it's time
To take back what's rightfully mine

I can see you want your life to end
You will bleed till your heart is dead

Pick up the gun my son
Pull the trigger, theres no where to run
Your child is with me
You will not be
I banish you to eternal pain
You lived your life in constant vain
I hear your pleas yet again
I can see you want an end"

Like two lost souls that soon collide
Tonight I witness all the angels throw
All of their stones down on me
The constant thorn that's in my flesh
Was solely placed and laid to rest
All that I am is all that you made
So you blaspheme me in your holy place
Ever so slowly the stranger becomes me
Oh ever so slowly I surrender blindly
Oh why am I forsaken?
My heart was forsaken
This broken man was fueled by rage
Through endless time he suffered pain
As all the stars light up the sky
My love remains dark in my eye
I felt the war, I fought alone
I sought mercy within your home
I was turned away, petition denied
I had no friends for this heart to confide
Ever so slowly the stranger becomes me
Oh ever so slowly I surrender blindly
Oh why am I forsaken?
My heart was forsaken"

The word came down to him from heaven
And naked as an animal he knew
Everything of flesh and bone
He could call it all his own
If he could name it, he could lay claim to it too

[Verse 2]
But after all the word was spoken
You sent him out into the open
All alone to make his broken promise whole again
Eight nine ten eleven twelve
Did you see how far he fell and did you watch him
Covering his body in his shame?

Wanting you near him
Though you couldn’t hear him
He was falling down
With your name in his mouth

A thousand thousand years pass through me
Stoned on loneliness and movies
Where people make their love in foreign tongues
Every family locks their door
Every man in uniform
Reminds me of the body of my own one

I knew you before I met you
I’ve forgotten why I left you
All I wanna do is get back in to your good grace
Call you by your hundred names
Till it makes you mine again
Until I get my will back in this god-forsaken place

I love to think of fuzzy hairs of fire swaying so
The shaman I saw yesterday told me simply, 'Go'
So I calmly left her teepee and went home without a noise

The psychics minds are sewing, but the gypsies' hands stay still
The worlds around them change and spin, and rain soaks their clothing
But, one yells out, whispering, 'It's all clearer to me now'
He dances in it, psychics sewing words he's yet to say

The bricks are catty-corner to the grease below them now
And every time I look at them I wonder who laid them
But, they've been here for ages, weather's touched these natural tiles
It's something I must leave behind and re-visit when I die

What I've meant to say this time is bugs are coming now
It's after dark, they're closing in, it was humid out today
And, one decides to try and make an entrance in my ear
Thinks my head is the bee hive and there the bounty will be found

Bugs behaving badly, get 'em to the prison now
I tell you, yes, it is their fault, you should spit 'em from the sky
But, if you have too kind a heart to cause these things to die
Then move on with my admiration trailing from behind
Bugs follow on like constellations frozen in the sky"

And times we had, I know they're through
These years that have passed erased my face

I drank to hide my fears
Never made intentions clear
Did you think that you would be replaced?

I thought of you in those times
You the girl I'd want for life
Now the time for that has passed away

Looking back across those years
I wonder if it'd help to hear
I was going to marry you someday

How could I say I needed you
When I didn't even know what you wanted from me?
How could I tell you what it meant
When I didn't even know if you'd ever loved me?
This resonance we shared
Is long gone, and have you cared?
I guess our chance was lost to fate

If you knew it, if you could
Feel it slip as things then stood
Did you feel you'd been betrayed?

I wasn't much of a man then
Didn't know what I'd never mend
I assumed we'd only stray

At times you'd look at me
I'd hope I'd still see
Something making me feel less ashamed

How could I say I needed you
When I didn't even know what you wanted from me?
How could I tell you what it meant
When I didn't even know if you'd ever loved me?

Now you know I'd think of you
But now, I seldom do
Those thoughts got in the way

I regret these words I had
Obsession has nothing to add
I will not be living out clichés
I think of you less each time
When the past still comes to mind
Does it seem just all a waste?

My answer's very clear
You weren't too concerned then, dear
I was a fool to give chase

How could I say I needed you
When I didn't even know what you wanted from me?
How could I tell you what it meant
When I didn't even know if you'd ever loved me?

2146,"When asked what I am working on, I often say I am writing a book about empathy. People tend to smile and nod, and then I add, “I’m against it.” This usually gets an uncomfortable laugh.

This reaction surprised me at first, but I’ve come to realize that taking a position against empathy is like announcing that you hate kittens—a statement so outlandish it can only be a joke. And so I’ve learned to clarify, to explain that I am not against morality, compassion, kindness, love, being a good neighbor, doing the right thing, and making the world a better place. My claim is actually the opposite: if you want to be good and do good, empathy is a poor guide.

The word “empathy” is used in many ways, but here I am adopting its most common meaning, which corresponds to what eighteenth-century philosophers such as Adam Smith called “sympathy.” It refers to the process of experiencing the world as others do, or at least as you think they do. To empathize with someone is to put yourself in her shoes, to feel her pain. Some researchers also use the term to encompass the more coldblooded process of assessing what other people are thinking, their motivations, their plans, what they believe. This is sometimes called “cognitive,” as opposed to “emotional,” empathy. I will follow this convention here, but we should keep in mind that the two are distinct—they emerge from different brain processes; you can have a lot of one and a little of the other—and that most of the discussion of the moral implications of empathy focuses on its emotional side.

Some degree of emotional empathy is bred in the bone. The sight and sound of another’s suffering is unpleasant for babies and, as soon as they are mobile enough, they try to help, patting and soothing others in distress. This is not uniquely human: the primatologist Frans de Waal notes that chimps will often put their arms around the victim of an attack and pat her or groom her.

Empathy can occur automatically, even involuntarily. Smith describes how “persons of delicate fibres” who notice a beggar’s sores and ulcers “are apt to feel an itching or uneasy sensation in the correspondent part of their own bodies.” John Updike writes, “My grandmother would have choking fits at the kitchen table, and my own throat would feel narrow in sympathy.”

And empathy can be extended through the imagination. In a speech before he became president, Barack Obama stressed how important it is

to see the world through the eyes of those who are different from us—the child who’s hungry, the steelworker who’s been laid off, the family who lost the entire life they built together when the storm came to town. . . . When you think like this—when you choose to broaden your ambit of concern and empathize with the plight of others, whether they are close friends or distant strangers—it becomes harder not to act, harder not to help.

Obama is right about this last part; there is considerable support for what the psychologist C. Daniel Batson calls “the empathy-altruism hypothesis”: when you empathize with others, you are more likely to help them. In general, empathy serves to dissolve the boundaries between one person and another; it is a force against selfishness and indifference.

It is easy to see, then, how empathy can be a moral good, and it has many champions. Obama talks frequently about empathy; witness his recent claim, after his first meeting with Pope Francis, that “it’s the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars. It’s the lack of empathy that allows us to ignore the homeless on the streets.” In The Empathetic Civilization (2009) Jeremy Rifkin argues that the only way our species will survive war, environmental degradation, and economic collapse is through the enhancement of “global empathy.” This past June, Bill and Melinda Gates concluded their Stanford commencement address by asking students to nurture and expand their empathetic powers, essential for a better world.

Most people see the benefits of empathy as too obvious to require justification. This is a mistake.

Most people see the benefits of empathy as akin to the evils of racism: too obvious to require justification. I think this is a mistake. I have argued elsewhere that certain features of empathy make it a poor guide to social policy. Empathy is biased; we are more prone to feel empathy for attractive people and for those who look like us or share our ethnic or national background. And empathy is narrow; it connects us to particular individuals, real or imagined, but is insensitive to numerical differences and statistical data. As Mother Teresa put it, “If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I will.” Laboratory studies find that we really do care more about the one than about the mass, so long as we have personal information about the one.
In light of these features, our public decisions will be fairer and more moral once we put empathy aside. Our policies are improved when we appreciate that a hundred deaths are worse than one, even if we know the name of the one, and when we acknowledge that the life of someone in a faraway country is worth as much as the life a neighbor, even if our emotions pull us in a different direction. Without empathy, we are better able to grasp the importance of vaccinating children and responding to climate change. These acts impose costs on real people in the here and now for the sake of abstract future benefits, so tackling them may require overriding empathetic responses that favor the comfort and well being of individuals today. We can rethink humanitarian aid and the criminal justice system, choosing to draw on a reasoned, even counter-empathetic, analysis of moral obligation and likely consequences.

But even if you accept this argument, there is a lot more to life than public policy. Consider our everyday interactions with our parents and children, with our partners and friends. Consider also certain special relationships, such as that between doctor and patient or therapist and client. Empathy might not scale up to the policy level, but it seems an unalloyed good when it comes to these intimate relationships—the more the better.

I used to believe this, but I am no longer sure.

One of empathy’s most thoughtful defenders is the psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen. In his 2011 book The Science of Evil, he draws upon psychology and neuroscience to argue that the notion of evil should be replaced with “empathy erosion” and that a high degree of empathy is what makes for good people and good societies.

Individuals differ in their disposition to feel empathy, and Baron-Cohen posits an empathy curve that runs from Level 0, where there is no empathy at all, to Level 6, where one is “continually focused on other people’s feelings . . . . in a constant state of hyperarousal, such that other people are never off their radar.” He sketches one such Level 6 individual:

Hannah is a psychotherapist who has a natural gift for tuning into how others are feeling. As soon as you walk into her living room, she is already reading your face, your gait, your posture. The first thing she asks you is ‘How are you?’ but this is no perfunctory platitude. Her intonation—even before you have taken off your coat—suggests an invitation to confide, to disclose, to share. Even if you just answer with a short phrase, your tone of voice reveals to her your inner emotional state, and she quickly follows up your answer with ‘You sound a bit sad. What’s happened to upset you?’

Before you know it, you are opening up to this wonderful listener, who interjects only to offer sounds of comfort and concern, to mirror how you feel, occasionally offering soothing words to boost you and make you feel valued. Hannah is not doing this because it is her job to do so. She is like this with her clients, her friends, and even people she has only just met. Hannah’s friends feel cared for by her, and her friendships are built around sharing confidences and offering mutual support. She has an unstoppable drive to empathize.

It is easy to see what Baron-Cohen finds so impressive here. Hannah sounds like a good therapist, and it seems as if she would also be a good mother to young children.

But consider what it must be like to be her. Hannah’s concern for other people doesn’t derive from particular appreciation or respect for them; her concern is indiscriminate and applies to strangers as well as friends. She also does not endorse a guiding principle based on compassion and kindness. Rather, Hannah is compelled by hyperarousal—her drive is unstoppable. Her experience is the opposite of selfishness but just as extreme. A selfish person might go through life indifferent to the pleasure and pain of others—ninety-nine for him and one for everyone else—while in Hannah’s case, the feelings of others are always in her head—ninety-nine for everyone else and one for her.

It is no accident that Baron-Cohen chose a woman as his example. In a series of empirical and theoretical articles, psychologists Vicki Helgeson and Heidi Fritz have explored why women are twice as likely as men to experience depression. Their results suggest that this divergence is explained in part by a sex difference in the propensity for “unmitigated communion,” defined as “an excessive concern with others and placing others’ needs before one’s own.” Helgeson and Fritz developed a simple nine-item questionnaire, which asks respondents to indicate whether they agree with statements such as, “For me to be happy, I need others to be happy,” “I can’t say no when someone asks me for help,” and “I often worry about others’ problems.” Women typically score higher than men on this scale; Hannah would, I bet, score high indeed.

Strong inclination toward empathy comes with costs. Individuals scoring high in unmitigated communion report asymmetrical relationships, where they support others but don’t get support themselves. They also are more prone to suffer depression and anxiety. Working from a different literature on “pathological altruism,” Barbara Oakley notes in Cold-Blooded Kindness (2011), “It’s surprising how many diseases and syndromes commonly seen in women seem to be related to women’s generally stronger empathy for and focus on others.”

Empathetic arousal is not the only force that motivates kindness.
The problems that arise here have to do with emotional empathy—feeling another’s pain. This leads to what psychologists call empathetic distress. We can contrast this with non-empathetic compassion—a more distanced love and kindness and concern for others. Such compassion is a psychological plus. Putting aside the obvious point that some degree of caring for others is morally right, kindness and altruism are associated with all sorts of positive physical and psychological outcomes, including a boost in both short-term mood and long-term happiness. If you want to get happy, helping others is an excellent way to do so.

It is worth expanding on the difference between empathy and compassion, because some of empathy’s biggest fans are confused on this point and think that the only force that can motivate kindness is empathetic arousal. But this is mistaken. Imagine that the child of a close friend has drowned. A highly empathetic response would be to feel what your friend feels, to experience, as much as you can, the terrible sorrow and pain. In contrast, compassion involves concern and love for your friend, and the desire and motivation to help, but it need not involve mirroring your friend’s anguish.

Or consider long-distance charity. It is conceivable, I suppose, that someone who hears about the plight of starving children might actually go through the empathetic exercise of imagining what it is like to starve to death. But this empathetic distress surely isn’t necessary for charitable giving. A compassionate person might value others’ lives in the abstract, and, recognizing the misery caused by starvation, be motivated to act accordingly.

Summing up, compassionate helping is good for you and for others. But empathetic distress is destructive of the individual in the long run.

It might also be of little help to other people because experiencing others’ pain is exhausting and leads to burnout. This issue is explored in the Buddhist literature on morality. Consider the life of a bodhisattva, an enlightened person who vows not to pass into Nirvana, choosing instead to stay in the normal cycle of life and death to help the masses. How is a bodhisattva to live? In Consequences of Compassion (2009) Charles Goodman notes the distinction in Buddhists texts between “sentimental compassion,” which corresponds to empathy, and “great compassion,” which involves love for others without empathetic attachment or distress. Sentimental compassion is to be avoided, as it “exhausts the bodhisattva.” Goodman defends great compassion, which is more distanced and reserved and can be sustained indefinitely.

This distinction has some support in the collaborative work of Tania Singer, a psychologist and neuroscientist, and Matthieu Ricard, a Buddhist monk, meditation expert, and former scientist. In a series of studies using fMRI brain scanning, Ricard was asked to engage in various types of compassion meditation directed toward people who are suffering. To the surprise of the investigators, these meditative states did not activate parts of the brain that are normally activated by non-meditators when they think about others’ pain. Ricard described his meditative experience as “a warm positive state associated with a strong prosocial motivation.”

He was then asked to put himself in an empathetic state and was scanned while doing so. Now the appropriate circuits associated with empathetic distress were activated. “The empathic sharing,” Ricard said, “very quickly became intolerable to me and I felt emotionally exhausted, very similar to being burned out.”

One sees a similar contrast in ongoing experiments led by Singer and her colleagues in which people are either given empathy training, which focuses on the capacity to experience the suffering of others, or compassion training, in which subjects are trained to respond to suffering with feelings of warmth and care. According to Singer’s results, among test subjects who underwent empathy training, “negative affect was increased in response to both people in distress and even to people in everyday life situations. . . . these findings underline the belief that engaging in empathic resonance is a highly aversive experience and, as such, can be a risk factor for burnout.” Compassion training—which doesn’t involve empathetic arousal to the perceived distress of others—was more effective, leading to both increased positive emotions and increased altruism.

This brings us to the targets of empathy. As I write this, an older relative of mine who has cancer is going back and forth to hospitals and rehabilitation centers. I’ve watched him interact with doctors and learned what he thinks of them. He values doctors who take the time to listen to him and develop an understanding of his situation; he benefits from this sort of cognitive empathy. But emotional empathy is more complicated. He gets the most from doctors who don’t feel as he does, who are calm when he is anxious, confident when he is uncertain. And he particularly appreciates certain virtues that have little directly to do with empathy, virtues such as competence, honesty, professionalism, and respect.

Leslie Jamison makes a similar point in her new essay collection The Empathy Exams. Jamison was at one time a medical actor—she would fake symptoms for medical students, who would diagnose her as part of their training. She also rated them on their skills. The most important entry on her checklist was number thirty-one: “Voiced empathy for my situation/problem.” But when she discusses her real experiences with doctors, her assessment of empathy is mixed. She met with one doctor who was cold and unsympathetic to her concerns, which caused her pain. But she is grateful to another who kept a reassuring distance and objectivity: “I didn’t need him to be my mother—even for a day—I only needed him to know what he was doing,” she writes. “His calmness didn’t make me feel abandoned, it made me feel secure. . . . I needed to look at him and see the opposite of my fear, not its echo.”

Or consider friendship and love. Hannah’s “soothing words,” her “sounds of comfort and concern” and mirroring of others’ feelings describe how a certain type of therapist treats a client or how a certain type of parent treats an anxious toddler. But this isn’t how friendship usually works. Friendship is rooted in symmetry and equality, shared projects, teasing and jokes and gossip, all of which are absent from a therapeutic relationship. While I might benefit from a friend’s therapy if I were feeling deeply anxious or depressed, I don’t, on the whole, want my friends to treat me like a suffering patient, softly murmuring reassurances when they detect that I’m out of sorts. Hannah’s “You sound a bit sad. What’s happened to upset you?” exemplifies what Jamison means when she says, “Empathy is always perched precariously between gift and invasion.”

Putting aside the extremes, do more empathetic people make better friends and partners? To my knowledge, this has never been studied. Certainly we want our friends to understand us and to care about us. It would be unnerving if someone I love never flinched in the face of my suffering or lit up at my joy. But this is not because I want them to mirror my feelings; rather, it is because if they love me, they should worry about my misfortunes and be pleased when I do well. From a purely selfish standpoint, I might not want their empathetic resonance, particularly when I am feeling down. I would prefer that they greet my panic with calm and my sadness with good cheer. As Cicero said about friendship—but he could just as well have been talking about close relationships in general—it “improves happiness and abates misery, by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief.”

When we think about individuals on the other extreme, what Baron-Cohen would describe as empathy Level 0, we naturally think about psychopaths, sociopaths, or antisocial/psychopathic personality types (the terms typically are used synonymously). Psychopaths are identified in poplar culture as the embodiment of evil. The term describes everyone from predatory CEOs to callous politicians to cannibal-killers such as Jeffrey Dahmer and the fictional Hannibal Lecter.

Being a good person is related to more distanced compassion, along with self-control, and a sense of justice.

There is a standard test for psychopathy developed by the psychologist Robert Hare. It is used to make legal decisions about criminal offenders, including whether they should be incarcerated for life, and used as well by experimental psychologists who give the test to undergraduates to explore how their scores relate to, for instance, attitudes toward sexual violence and their style of moral reasoning. If you like this sort of thing, you can take the test online, rating yourself on traits such as “glibness/superficial charm,” “lack of remorse or guilt,” and “promiscuous sexual
behavior.”

The most important item for many people is “callous/lack of empathy.” Many popular treatments of psychopathy, such as Jon Ronson’s 2011 bestseller The Psychopath Test, see a lack of empathy as the core deficit in psychopathy. It is here that cognitive and emotional empathy come apart, because many people diagnosed with psychopathy are excellent at reading others’ minds. This is what enables them to be such masterful manipulators, con men, and seducers. But the emotional part is thought to be absent—they cannot feel other people’s pain—and this is why psychopaths are such terrible people.

This might be the popular picture, but the truth is more complicated. For one thing, as philosopher Jesse Prinz points out, psychopaths suffer from dulling of just about all emotional responses, not just empathy. This overall blunting of feeling—or “shallow affect”—is one of the criteria on the checklist. It was observed by Harvey Cleckley in The Mask of Sanity, his 1941 book that provided the first clinical description of psychopathy:

Vexation, spite, quick and labile flashes of quasi-affection, peevish resentment, shallow moods of self-pity, puerile attitudes of vanity, and absurd and showy poses of indignation are all within his emotional scale and are freely sounded as the circumstances of life play upon him. But mature, wholehearted anger, true or consistent indignation, honest, solid grief, sustaining pride, deep joy, and genuine despair are reactions not likely to be found within this scale.

It is unclear, then, whether an empathy deficit is at the core of psychopathy, or whether it is just one facet of a more general problem. One can explore this by looking at how well scores on the callous/lack of empathy item and certain related items are correlated with future bad behavior. In an extensive review of the literature, psychologist Jennifer Skeem and her colleagues note that these items are weak predictors of violence and criminality. The reason why the psychopath test has any predictive power at all is that it assesses past bad behavior—juvenile delinquency, criminal versatility, parasitic lifestyle, and so on—as well as factors such as lack of inhibition and poor impulse control. To put it another way, you can remove the empathy question from the scale, and it would be about as good at picking out psychopaths.

What about aggressive behavior more generally? Are more aggressive people less empathetic? Even I, a skeptic, would imagine there is some substantive relationship between empathy and aggression, since presumably someone with a great deal of empathy would find it unpleasant to cause pain in others. But a recent review summarizing data from all available studies of the relationship between empathy and aggression reaches a different conclusion. The authors of “The (non)relation between empathy and aggression: Surprising results from a meta-analysis” report that only 1 percent of the variation in aggression is accounted for by empathy. This means that if you want to predict how aggressive a person is, and you have access to an enormous amount of information about that person, including psychiatric interviews, pen-and-paper tests, criminal records, and brain scans, the last thing you would bother to look at would be measures of the person’s empathy.

Finally, one decisive test of the low-empathy-makes-bad-people theory would be to study a group of people who lack empathy but also lack the other traits associated with psychopathy. Such individuals do exist. Baron-Cohen notes that people with Asperger syndrome and autism typically have low cognitive empathy—they struggle to understand the minds of others—and have low emotional empathy as well. (As with psychopaths, there is some controversy about whether they are incapable of empathy or choose not to deploy it.) Despite their empathy deficit, such people show no propensity for exploitation and violence. Indeed, they often have strong moral codes and are more likely to be victims of cruelty than perpetrators.

• • •

Am I saying that empathy is irrelevant or a corrosive influence on how we treat those around us? This would be too strong a conclusion. There are many studies that look at individual differences in empathy levels and correlate these levels with real-world behavior, such as willingness to help someone in need. Many of these studies are poorly done. They often measure empathy through self-report, so you don’t know whether you are assessing actual empathy as opposed to the degree to which people see themselves, or want to be seen, as empathetic. Furthermore, people who help others more may assume that they are empathetic, since people often make judgments about themselves by drawing conclusions from their own behavior.

Nonetheless, there is some evidence that being more empathetic influences how likely one is to help in certain circumstances. The relationship is often weak, and not all studies find it. Still, given laboratory findings showing that inducing empathy increases the likelihood of altruistic behaviors, it would be wrong to dismiss empathy’s role in our moral lives.

But we know that a high level of empathy does not make one a good person and that a low level does not make one a bad person. Being a good person likely is more related to distanced feelings of compassion and kindness, along with intelligence, self-control, and a sense of justice. Being a bad person has more to do with a lack of regard for others and an inability to control one’s appetites.

So how much empathy do we really want in ourselves, our children, our friends, and our society? If you want to answer that question, it helps to think about a quite different emotional response—anger.

Empathy and anger share a lot. Both emerge in early childhood and exist in every human culture. Both are present in other primates such as chimpanzees. Both are social. Unlike emotions such as fear and disgust, which are often elicited by experiences and inanimate beings, empathy and anger are mainly geared toward other people. And they are both moral. The identification that comes with empathy can motivate kind behavior toward others; anger is often a response to perceived unfairness, cruelty, and other immoral acts.

Buddhist texts are even more skeptical about anger than they are about empathy. They see it as destructive of the individual and the world at large. This is a valid concern. But if I could determine the emotional life of my child, I wouldn’t leave out the capacity for anger. The emotional force of anger can protect us and those we are close to from exploitation and predation. Someone who could never get angry would be the perfect victim. Anger can also be a prod to moral behavior more generally; many great moral heroes—Martin Luther King, Jr., for instance—have been individuals who let themselves get angry at situations that others were indifferent to.

But I would worry about the irrational, arbitrary, and self-destructive aspects of anger, so I wouldn’t wish that my child possess too much of it. And I would make sure to add plenty of intelligence, concern for others, and self-control. I would want to ensure that anger is modified, shaped, and directed by rational deliberation. It would occasionally spur action, but it would be subservient to the capacities for rationality and compassion. If we were all constituted in this way, if we could all put anger in its place, ours would be a kinder and better world.

That is how we should think about empathy too."

Walking towards me, and I knew I should've crossed the road
A bunch of black cats would always lead to superstition
I could see it before it happened, supervision

You're walking with your woman and she fine
So of course she causes looking, alright, look but don't touch
But some bruddas moving reckless like they looking to fight
About ""wah gwan babes?"" like say man's invisible
Disrespect, could you believe what this nigga said?
Ellis, I should push your wig forward, make you think ahead
Now I'm squaring up in front of a circle
And I sense I can get wrecked in this tangle, yeah, I rap
But what the fuck had you thinking that the punch'd be verbal?
Man are coming at me from every angle
See, I [?] rush in and feel like I've been mugged off
Ahh, camera's out, my face
Worldstar, mugshot
Bruddas wanna hold me off
F that, sunblock
Rappers wanna battle me
Save that for JumpOff

Take all my pain away with the night
Align my way, align my heart
Help me find my way through these parts

And the hour is getting late

And now I'm back here again
All of this time we never saw the sun

And all I have one less ghost in my heart

Stuck in my mind like something I am addicted to
But I can't read your mind and Lord knows that you can't read mine
I know 'cause I've tried to see
If you ever, ever think of me

I can't find peace and quiet quite like I used to
'Cause I'm too busy thinking about what I think about you
Said I can't find peace and quiet quite like I used to
'Cause I'm too busy thinking about what I think about you

Spent so long just dreaming, dreaming of you and me
Hoping one day I'll choose the correct words to speak
But until that time I'm still wondering
If you feel the way I do
If you do, I would be with you

I can't find peace and quiet quite like I used to
'Cause I'm too busy thinking about what I think about you
Said I can't find peace and quiet quite like I used to

Went from sinner to saint
Well I won’t say ima saint
But Ima say that I’m saved
I’m tryna keep it that way

And yes I know I still sin
But as a Christian I’m not
Labeled a sinner no mo
In fact I’m try-ina stop

It altogether I’m gon be better than yesterday
Look around I see everything is a mess today
Then I stop and remember that I am blessed today
Can’t be doubtin my God when I know his Resume

If it wasn’t for Jesus there would not be a point
Like no kyrie or Russell Westbrook you get the point
Have to find me new hope and I’m not talkin Star Wars
Still be tryin to climb to heaven Like we love parcore
I was sinnin but now I’m winnin just look at God
Won’t he do it he’ll get you through it no matter what
Gave me purpose I broke the surface and now I’ve got
Motivation it’s got me racin to reach the top

Livin for myself oh, was a slave
Didn’t know that I was lost til, you called my name
There’s no turnin back now, there's no turnin back now


(Mitch Darrell)
Went from goin to church
To actin on what I heard
At age 14 I was sure
That I believed every word

So I went up to the front
Confessed that Jesus was theeee
Son of God and I was dunked
Under the water with ease

Now flash forward a decade and life has gotten hard
Yes I’m still a believer but sometimes He feels far
I’m not prayin as frequently and it’s not as fervent
To be honest I often catch myself skipping service
Must remember the reason that I became a Christian
And get back to the passion I had when I would listen
To each sermon attentively with an open bible
Annotatin the pages of my guide to survival

Tryna get up to heaven is like a marathon
Sorta Racin but gotta pace it we there and gone
Life’s a vapor it’s weak as paper so we must try
To live life like we’re jesus righteous until we die

Once upon a time I, wore the shame
Livin for myself oh, was a slave
Didn’t know that I was lost til, you called my name

Out on the street you hear their laughter
And pretty green eyes have turned to blue
Everything you've heard I've gotten

Took awhile baby to unfurl
Meanwhile another girl

Never heard too much

To say what's up to everybody else but me

Take a look at me
Dreams turned to apathy
Where did I go wrong?
Take a look at me

(gone gone gone gone gone gone)

Maybe you didn't maybe you did
Maybe you lost it maybe you quit
You fell on your face
You're fading away
And now you know  the world is moving on with you
Oh oh oh oh
Oh you should know
Oh oh oh
That this entire world's moving on with out you

Thats why I...
Gone dead and gone dead and gone
The time for talking is dead and...
Dead and gone"
8146,"Look into these eyes and see
I'll not be what you want me to be
Shake my hand and stake your claim
You'll only fan the flame

Seeds of love
Won't leave you cold or flat oh no
More effective than a baseball bat
Now what you think of that?

Look into these eyes and know
I'll not go where you want me to go
You can't move me I'm in too deep
I am no longer asleep

You ain't never gonna change my mind
Too many years since my eyes were blind
But look into my heart that yearns
I'll show you why it burns"
1217,"There you go again, I wish that this would end cuz
I can never tell if you wanna be more than friends and
I wanna give up, but I just can't get enough of ya, of ya

An all of my friends are saying ""that boy ain't shit"", but if I cover up my ears then I can't listen to them and
I see all the signs, but if I pretend that I'm blind then how am I to know what's wrong or right?

Uh uh, Uh uh, Uh uh, Uh uh

You only wanna talk when you're drunk at 2am, and I just wanna know what this is


You seem like you're persistent, then suddenly you're distant
All I want is some attention from ya

You act like you want me but maybe that's lies
You only hit me up late at night
Could you just let me know if you're wasting my time

You only wanna talk when you're drunk at 2am, and I just wanna know what this is
You either want me or you don't, but if not then you should go, so I can get you off my mind and move on with my life
Just let me know how you feel, just tell me if it's real, or if I'm reading this wrong, or if you were leading me on

You only wanna talk when you're drunk at 2am, Uh uh, Uh uh
You either want me or you don't but if not then you should go, Uh uh, Uh uh

You only wanna talk when you're drunk at 2am, how am i supposed to know what this is?
You either want me or you don't but if not then I'll let go, could you please just let me know

You only wanna talk when, you only wanna talk when you're..."
7946,"I'm on my 9 to 5 hustle and grind
Working on, working on, working on
Leaving this silly little life behind
Probably just til Monday comes
Cause when the weeks is done
I've been know to freak some fun
And it normally goes on
Until the morning light
Drunk and singing Journey songs
Up in my room

I'm so fly
Sliding on the wood in my socks
Working on, working on, working on
Drinking this bottle of wine I got
Cause ain't no room for judgment here
Cause if anyone finds me
They'll probably say I'm high
But don't pay 'em never mind
Cause I'm doing fine
I just came to party like, party like, party like, party
Like I'm out of my mind
I can watch my Star Wars box set twice
Working on, working on, working on
Trying to beat my Donky Kong score for life
That ain't easy to do, girl
Cause once the party's started
I'm known to get retarded
And blast Jefferson Starship
And get it right
Drunk, making dance moves up in my room

I can jump all the way over my couch
Working on, working on, working on
Getting my high notes right out loud
A karaoke master at night
And if anyone saw me
They'd probably feel awkward
Cause I'd be in a GWAR suit
And loving life
Cause I just came to party like, party like...
I'm out of my mind"

I do not know
How to control the fire in my heart

I do not know

I just said I feel for you

(Ah, ooh-e)

5658,"Out of the gray northwest, where many a day gone by
Ye tugged and howled in your tempestuous grot,
And evermore the huge frost giants lie,
Your wizard guards in vigilance unforgot,
Out of the gray northwest, for now the bonds are riven,
On wide white wings your thongless flight is driven,
That lulls but resteth not.
And all the gray day long, and all the dense wild night,
Ye wheel and hurry with the sheeted snow,
By cedared waste and many a pine-dark height,
Across white rivers frozen fast below;
Over the lonely forests, where the flowers yet sleeping
Turn in their narrow beds with dreams of weeping
In some remembered woe;
Across the unfenced wide marsh levels, where the dry
Brown ferns sigh out, and last year's sedges scold
In some drear language, rustling haggardly
Their thin dead leaves and dusky hoods of gold;
Across gray beechwoods where the pallid leaves unfalling
In the blind gusts like homeless ghosts are calling
With voices cracked and old;
Across the solitary clearings, where the low
Fierce gusts howl through the blinded woods, and round
The buried shanties all day long the snow
Sifts and piles up in many a spectral mound;
Across lone villages in eerie wildernesses
Whose hidden life no living shape confesses
Nor any human sound;
Across the serried masses of dim cities, blown
Full of the snow that ever shifts and swells,
While far above them all their towers of stone
Stand and beat back your fierce and tyrannous spells,
And hour by hour send out, like voices torn and broken
Of battling giants that have grandly spoken,
The veering sound of bells;
So day and night, O Wind, with hiss and moan you fleet,
Where once long gone on many a green-leafed day
Your gentler brethren wandered with light feet
And sang, with voices soft and sweet as they,
The same blind thought that you with wilder might are speaking,
Seeking the same strange thing that you are seeking
In this your stormier way.
O Wind, wild-voicèd brother, in your northern cave,
My spirit also being so beset
With pride and pain, I heard you beat and rave,
Grinding your chains with furious howl and fret,
Knowing full well that all earth's moving things inherit
The same chained might and madness of the spirit,
That none may quite forget.
You in your cave of snows, we in our narrow girth
Of need and sense, for ever chafe and pine;
Only in moods of some demonic birth
Our souls take fire, our flashing wings untwine;
Even like you, mad Wind, above our broken prison,
With streaming hair and maddened eyes uprisen,
We dream ourselves divine;
Mad moods that come and go in some mysterious way,
That flash and fall, none knoweth how or why,
O Wind, our brother, they are yours today,
The stormy joy, the sweeping mastery;
Deep in our narrow cells, we hear you, we awaken,
With hands afret and bosoms strangely shaken,
We answer to your cry.
I most that love you, Wind, when you are fierce and free,
In these dull fetters cannot long remain;
Lo, I will rise and break my thongs and flee
Forth to your drift and beating, till my brain
Even for an hour grow wild in your divine embraces,
And then creep back into mine earthly traces,
And bind me with my chain.
Nay, Wind, I hear you, desperate brother, in your might
Whistle and howl; I shall not tarry long,
And though the day be blind and fierce, the night
Be dense and wild, I still am glad and strong
To meet you face to face; through all your gust and drifting
With brow held high, my joyous hands uplifting,
I cry you song for song."

Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go
Got my speakers turned up, rattle in my trunk
But I never gave a fuck
So you know I'm ready to go
You know I'm ready to go

[Verse 1 - Chris Webby:]
I've been ready to go, full sprint, I'm ahead of the flow
Strap C-4 to my chest, know that Webby'll blow
I've had this mean demeanor in me since forever ago
Nothin' but green lights ahead, I push the pedal and go
A veteran pro, veins pump seven below
And will cruise until he got it, never settlin' so
I'm ready to go, movin' quickly in my pole position
No one holdin' Christian, more venomous than a cobra spittin'
Crush you, no position, with the illest and dopest rhythm
Cause they soft, weak-hearted and wack with no ambition
I'm Obi Wan Kanobi with the flow you can't control me
I'm a mixture of Paulie, Christopher, Sylvio and Tony
An honorary Soprano, with mono y mono
With Castallano, and hit 'em with a Liu Kang combo
Skin tone blanco
Though when I get up on the beat, I spit 'til I'm blue in the face lookin' like Ganzo

Okay, what's good, Chris, thanks for lettin' me on this song
They'll catch a buzz for light-years, to infinity and beyond
My affinity falls, the liquor has been bitter sweet all along
Though to the best of my abilities, then breeze homie, I'm gone
Let's get it Webby, son, I'm ready to go
Just drop me off at the liquor store to get some Henny to pour
I hope in CT they got that good heady to smoke
(Shitstain) Well I'm dope, thanks for lettin' me know
I'm a cocky young wordsmith, stickin' to the cursin'
And tryna make my word fit in one of these bird's lips
I see you hawkin', pigeon for the squawkin'
But when I give her the rooster she diggin' them eagle claws in
I'm leaving with back scratches, bruises and open gashes
Jesus, I'm looking like Christ from the Passion
Rock new clothes but a nigga old-fashioned
Hit it, then she runnin' back, yeah, Bo Jackson

[Verse 3 - Chris Webby:]
Yeah, yeah, I'm not like these punks who lack hustle
I'm big, they weaker than Stephen Hawking's calf muscles
Nothin' but trouble with a dub up in my bubbler
Hotter than summer under a Goosedown comforter
Hennessy up in my cup still I never stutter words
THC runnin' through my jugular, fuckin' serve
Anybody who thinks I'm just a gimmick, I spit it how I live it
That's why everyone on Twitter had to click it
I'm the raider of the lost ark
Make the DJ bring it back like a false start
This ain't a fallacy, my dude, cause I can truly flow
And play the hand I was dealt, somethin' like Yu-Gi-Oh
Since a long time ago, spittin' freestyle or flow
Drunk with a pen in my hand like Edgar Allen Poe
And I won't stop 'til I'm a millionaire
Put the pieces together, bitch, Build-A-Bear

Got the weed in my dutch, liquor in my cup
But I never gave a fuck

You know I'm ready to go

Just to come back to you
Oh my love
My sweet love
It’s a long and lonesome highway
It’s a bitter shade of blue
Oh my love

And I never had much money
I never been quite satisfied
But you can weave the unraveled strings
And you ease my worried mind
You ease my worried mind

Tell you what I’ll do
When I come back to you

Gonna wrap myself around you
And sing to you this tune

Where I shall only be dust
I won't give anything more

I will finally be quiet
Silence will surround me
And for the first time ever
I will end the slow destruction

Eternal peace
Entropia
Chaos waves
No more loss
I free the earth
From this weight of ashes

From the day we were born
To our very last breath
We feed this forever hungry beast
That will tear the world apart
All mеn shall plead guilty
Of being slave to agony
For wе are all agents of chaos
We are setting the world on fire

Eternal peace

We share a pale blue dot
A fragile unique system
We vomit on this gem
The filth of our mankind
We vomit on this gem
The filth of our mankind

In my dreams I wish I could be
Just a invisible draft travelling the earth
Able to admire the sun and the intact purity
Of a virgin unsoiled earth and sky
But we are born from this maelstrom
Of emotions, energy and needs
We are driven by desires and greed
For we are all agents of chaos

Eternal peace
Entropia
Chaos waves
No more loss
I free the earth
From this weight of ashes

Oh laisse-moi enfin partir
Aide-moi à faire de mon existence
Autre chose qu'une rivière de boue

4052,"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The Good Book says ""Go seek and ye shall find"";
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!

My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm ""fair and warmer""
When he's gone I'm ""cloudy with showers""
In emotion, like the ocean, it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like him!

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental
Not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Crying my heart out!
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good
So bad, so bad!

I got it so bad, so bad
Though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him
I can't live without him!

Lord above me
Make him love me
The way he should!
Like a lonely weeping willow
Lost in the wood
The things I tell mt pillow
No woman should!
I got it bad, bad
So bad and that ain't good!"
1847,"[Stanza]

What will be?
No-- What is it?
New escape, new drip-drip-drip
Slipping; meditative trip
Terrestrial grip squeezing
Whatever's left is seeping
Out of cracks and crevices
Is that the truth I taste and smell?
A concoction of sorts
It's vomit, of course
Poisoning the flesh
The rest remains obscure
Such a puzzling thought
To think what was, wasn't reality at all
So what is? What is it? I ask again
A locked bedroom in a dark house?
Too bright, the outside
Family steps out
Out from behind a cracked window
Venting my perceived unenlightenment
Expressing my whatever
[Verse]
Expressing my whatever; my thoughts are never together
An unorganized uprising, scheduled under stormy weather
And yet, that's the jazz of it all
The bebop, fusion, free, swing, and rap of it all
Always happy to call your bluff. Your magic is flawed
Your illusion ain't confusing or distracting me at all
Even though it's obvious ""all"" and ""all"" don't go together
Repeating my scheme, while expressing my whatever"

Fleshless fingers brace crumbling edges
To propel forth their bodies of rot
What purpose have they returned?
To what bidding do they serve?
Ravenous lust for flesh smothers the trace humanity that exists behind their blank, putrefying eyes
Plunder and devour the remnants of the dead
Murder and eat credulous living

I'm loosing my voice, yeah I'm loosing my hearing
I don't fuck with bitches, they play with my feelings
There's tears in my eyes, that shit having me blinking
Blinking (x12)
[Verse 2: REMORSE666]
Off of the shits, I be blinking
Immortal Sin, bitch got me thinking
Sip on some lean, bitch I'm drinking
Immortal Sin, bitch got me thinking
Blinking (x8)"

Dig deep like a tapeworm
Hear my words and wait your turn
Understand, little man
I been at it tryna get the upper hand
Butter colored rugby with a hint of burgundy
I ain’t in a fraternity
You finicky, it ain’t concerning me
I’m busy being who i wanna be
On my time, on my own dime
From H-Town to Irvine
Like Earth, Wind, and Fire I’m a legacy
When I bless the beat
Press repeat, overstand all of my demands
First, know I came to burst and disperse heat
Need no advance
Fuck a label, I’m aware and able
Been heard all the scams
Y’all wanna start a brand
I’m here to make music that lasts
I don’t tap dance for your LLC to get bands
Got it out the mud, gloves still dirty
Sweat on my Doc Martens
[Revenge Wife - Chorus]
Swear to God, we got a lot
We gotta make it, they can take it how they like
We got a vibe, don’t keep it quiet
We gonna make it, they can take it how they
Swear to God, we got a lot
We gotta make it, they can take it how they like
I swear to God, don’t keep it quiet
We gotta make it, they can take it how they


[Fat Tony - Verse 2]
Did it all, didn’t do it on my own
No one can do it all alone
Don’t you diss
Don’t dismiss them that’s been witcha
And still witcha
‘Cause these days
Everybody got an agenda of their own
Share a dream with somebody you barely know
Let that dream bring y’all together
Then that shit can’t be cloned
That shit can’t be owned
That’s y’all
Wish I could ball with you every night
‘Cause you believe in my soul
And I believe in all we’ve known
[Revenge Wife - Chorus]
Swear to God, we got a lot
We gotta make it, they can take it how they like
We got a vibe, don’t keep it quiet
We gonna make it, they can take it how they
Swear to God, we got a lot
We gotta make it, they can take it how they like
I swear to God, don’t keep it quiet
We gotta make it, they can take it how they"

[Verse:]
Last night my dad called
My dad called, he
Asked me about Rogue One
Asked me if I smoke blunts
Ask me if my flow’s nuts
And I be like ‘oh yup’
Yeah, dad knew before I did
Smooth wind chilling
Not til after he was gone
Would I make a flip
After he was gone
That’s when I would make a flip
Kick kick bap, that’s what he did back there
Click click snap, he kept that rhythm, fast air
I listened to Vast Aire and talk confidence and hip-hop
Which he responded to by opening his box
Oh wow, my dad he opened up his box
To show me stolen items, show me all the stuff
He’d taken from my magnum opus idols so
When he choked I filed those missing items
Down inside him, yeah I know my mama would like ‘em
I know if I know what like all that shit that went to Tyler
So I guess no physical will keeps you hype though
Now I have the will to connect with no eyes though
Yes, my dad called, he
Asked me about Rogue One
Asked me if I smoke blunts
He ask me if my flow’s nuts
And I be like ‘oh yup’
Yup, and I be like ‘oh yup’
Dad knew before I did
That smooth wind chilling
Not til after he was gone
Would I make a flip
After he was gone
That’s when I would make a flip
I said, I retcon lore easily
I felt strong when he needed me
Manifested from my thin slices
Directing my naked ass to a line
I felt my time stretching thin
Kept the well-[?] trimmed in my backpack
Usually forgot to pop the pill until my last class
Damn, now I can’t fucking sleep, kept the heat on
Feel trapped at home with no where to burn my keys off
So I scribbled the words that release thoughts
Raw Navel made it possible for me to
Cross the receipt off, I’m thinking ‘bout my lone
Crushed by this rap shit, on my throne
Etching stones in my own black dress
And to think that was said, that’s a fat mess"
1684,"This song was mostly written on a train ride
Down the west coast while on tour. Hadn't
Ridden a train since I was a kid...

September in seattle
Waiting on a train
I smoked my last cigarette
Standing in out of the rain
There's a cool wind blowin
Down the alley by the depot
Amtrak down the coastline
To the city of the roses
Mam's hangin hand me downs
Daddy1s in the hotel bar
Kids reciting mother goose
Running naked through the yard
You see the best and the worst here
The richest and the poor
From the mansions on the hilltop
To the red dirt floor
Pull into the station
The sun's settin outside
The pushers and the pullers
Tryin to take you for a ride
Portland is a small town
With a bitter city smile
And as I walk these streets wround
I might just hang here for a while"
5259,"I think of days of youth
When snow would come and we would play
And jump down from the roof
Careless of the consequences
Screaming through the night; Committing senseless, stupid crimes
We’re Drinking dark-red poisoned wine; Slowly Losing sense of time
But as truth shines through the rotten sun
We screamed with realization  - THE THRILL IS GONE

HERE COMES YOUR MOTHER

She steps into the church
She bows down to the god she never knew or kissed or loved
She prays for mercy seas to take her
Far away from harm, To be cared for and be loved
To cry out the names of god; And to be guided through the dark
But as truth shines through the rotten sun
She screams with realization -  THE THRILL IS GONE

HERE COMES YOUR MOTHER
I think of days of youth, endless hours, wasted time
While being blind for the truth
Nothing lasts and nothing stays
Now we are torn apart, draw your daggers through your hearts
Pull your dreams and hopes at last for the lonesome times have passed
But as truth shines through the rotten sun
We screamed with realization  - THE THRILL IS GONE"
9503,"It's just one of those days when
Nothing wants to go alright
So I slipped on a brand new shirt and stepped out into the night
And as I rode down the road in my Benz
See you standin' with a man
You was chilling with my best friend
Acting like he's all you need
When last night you was tryin' to get it on with me

-BRIDGE
You're making your moves on me, baby
It's wrong but it feels so right
You're trying to play with me, lady
But it won't go down tonight...

-CHORUS
You wanna roll with me, roll with me...
Mess about
You better keep it low before we get found out
I wanna rock with you, rock with you...
All night
Dance with your body until the morning light
You wanna bounce with me, bounce with me...
Take it slow
Don't wanna jeopardize, gotta let you know
If you're leaving tonight, it will all be alright
Girl, you keep it on a down low
You keep on tellin' me nobody has to know
But you don't wanna compromise
Always keep a brother hooked with your bedroom eyes
Gonna do what I can to keep it real
But inside what I feel, baby girl, what the deal now?
Even though I always lose
Either way that I play but I gotta choose...

CHORUS TO fade"
4246,"Upon this lowly railroad spike my hammer swung and fell. Down the mighty Mississipp,' where the raging waters swell. In the corner of that factory, a dark man-made hell
I'll be sitting there in my snare making what they sell
With a silver spoon breaking my teeth, the boys on the line working just to eat. Are you picturing the stories that I sing?
A child working day and night
A father turned into a ghostly sight
The wage slave knows so well that hopeless strain
Of a poor man just trying to remain
As he pays his toll of pain

From the dear old age of Adam to the workers of Boaz
We've been doomed to sing this crazy song, yet it's made me who I am
From the steel workers in Pittsburgh, to the trucker and his load
All feeding that old fat cat just hoping he'll explode

With a silver spoon breaking my teeth
The boys on the line working just to eat, are you picturing the stories that I sing?
A child working day and night
A father turned into a ghostly sight
The wage slave knows so well that hopeless strain
Of a poor man trying to remain
As he pays his toll of pain
We've been working for far too long
We've been doomed to hear this lowly song for our sons
Our sweat must be working just to fall
I'm a slave to that whistle call
I'm a slave to that whistle call

From the dear old age of Adam to the workers of Boaz
We've been doomed to sing this crazy song, yet it's made me who I am
From the steel workers in Pittsburgh, to the trucker and his load
All feeding that old fat cat just hoping he'll explode

With a silver spoon breaking my teeth, the boys on the line working just to eat, are you picturing the stories that I sing?
A child working day and night
A father turned into a ghostly sight
The wage slave knows so well that hopeless strain
Of a poor man trying to remain
As he pays his toll of pain

As he pays his toll of pain
We've been working for far too long
We've been doomed to hear this crazy song for our sons
Our sweat must be working just to fall
I'm a slave to that whistle call
I'm a slave to that whistle call. I'm a slave"
9318,"Remember back in grade school them drug free ribbons?
When quarterly students stuck 'em on with gold pins?
Your school probably did shit differently still
I’m sure some remember or relate quite well but
Swell even if not throw that clock forward
Toward your future ten years then try to count who sober
Know at least one of five probably can’t check that box
Even me Fox prone to smoke too much pot but know
That be not the plot see my point be while some
Seek the normal others stride to appoint their
Position on these tables to that rank read with difference since
Promise of a life tomorrow still not certain though
What be next? A question one might often ask
When they find themselves lost walking' up the wrong path
My advice be head back to start
Where you first made depart then seize that lost piece of heart

It’s been quite the year but here still alive
With a smile on face aim set towards the sky
It’s been quite the month but I’m still on the truck
With thou feet to this street on route towards the front
It’s been quite the week but I’m still on these beats
Running laps on tracks like Olympic track meets
It’s been quite the day but know I’m okay
Shall tonight come as last guess Fox beat the game
Come time these childhood staples get erased
Ripped down then replaced rebuilt and renamed
Though it hurts to see the change more so to feel the growth
Know onward only route forth towards the goal though
Stoked for the future still I'm scared to lose the past
So I keep the best of times close to heart while they last
Carve record in slab via stillmatic tracks
Seal life here forever through rap boom and bap
In these 22 years I’ve been alive here on earth
See I’ve learned a lot of shit through the best from the worst
Been hurt quite a bit but still in one piece
More air left to breathe more sights left to see
For that I be grateful always thankful nothing less
Now nothing can derail this train that’s a fact
I'ma ride this track till the end and beyond
For immortal I remain via play of this song

It’s been quite the year but here still alive
With a smile on face aim set towards the sky
It’s been quite the month but I’m still on the truck
With thou feet to this street on route towards the front
It’s been quite the week but I’m still on these beats
Running laps on tracks like Olympic track meets
It’s been quite the day but know I’m okay
Shall tonight come as last know Fox beat the game"
5673,"We are the makers of the universe and we are here to destroy your gods
You might think that you're indestructible but through our eyes you'll see your not

Cursed with this life for an eternity Immortality is an absolute certainty
We cannot see our own end in sight
Forever seeking ways to enter the light

Enter the light
No end in sight

Traversing the Galaxy all alone
Absorbing knowledge as we slaughter the drones
We are all powerful once again
We will scout the universe seeking an end

Spreading death across this world
Hope is just a facade
We are tired of your games and we will burn your house of God

We are the end of all creation
We are the end of all creation
Kneel before us motherfuckers
Death is a fate you can't escape

You cannot escape it

Destiny awaits you on the path to knowledge a greater man with ideas of destruction staring deep into your soul with these eyes of
Destiny awaits you on your path to knowledge a greater man with ideas of Destruction staring deep into your soul with these eyes of death"
