6589,"I swear there's no more point in serching cause i found
My goal, my goal
They say that when you got a good thing, baby
Then you'll know, you'll know
And i'll admit, it happened quick
But what's a man suppose to do
Cause ever since that second kiss
I've been with you, with you, with you, with you
7 days a week
My friends go but they can't get a hold of me
They tell me that i've changed
Their right i'm not the same
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I can't believe it
7 days a week
For breakfast and untill we fall asleep
I'm loosing track of time, got one thing on my mind
Wanna be with you, only with you
I quit my job cause I don't even care no more, no more
Let's stay inside trough fifthteen locks and this front door, front door
Unplug the phones, cut of the power
No need to leave, to leave
Cause every day, and every hour
Turns out to be, to be, to be, to be
7 days a week
My friends go but they can't get a hold of me
They tell me that i've changed, they're right i'm not the same
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I can't believe it
7 days a week
For breakfast and untill we fall asleep
I'm loosing track of time, got one thing on my mind
Wanna be with you, only with you
And i'll admit, it happend quick
But what's a man suppose to do
Cause ever since that second kiss
I've been with you, with you, with you, with you
7 days a week
My friends go but they can't get a hold of me
They tell me that i've changed, they're right i'm not the same
I'm in love with you, in love with you
I can't believe it
7 days a week
For breakfast and untill we fall asleep
I'm loosing track of time, got one thing on my mind
Wanna be with you, only with you"
5552,"She : ""Dear diary... it's so stupid...""

Tears of fear coruscated my face
Tears of joy course the length of my days
Tainted blood tracks in my veins
Bleak sadness, he will come soon
Will I ever be
Truly wholly free
Of this agony
It's not left me, this blood of mine today
What would you think of me, Mother, if I should say
(If you should learn about my stains?)
I can see your face; blackened with rage
Twisted in hatred (denying the cage I have wrought)
My bliss drains...
I wish I could say how I became this way
Stark fear
He will come
Now I want it
Now I sense him
Is he the one?
Mother there are dark rings under your eyes
Your hand raised to slap as you realise
I wish I could say
It would be okay
She (about her diary): ""...He (the embryon) thinks your a therapy..."""
9110,":  Speak to me.             Take my hand.               What are you now?
I will tell you all.             I will conceal nothing.
When I was three, a little child read a story about a rabbit
who died, in the story, and I crawled under a chair    :
a pink rabbit    :    it was my birthday, and a candle
burnt a sore spot on my finger, and I was told to be happy.

:  Oh, grow to know me.        I am not happy.        I will be open:
Now I am thinking of white sails against a sky like music,
like glad horns blowing, and birds tilting, and an arm about me.
There was one I loved, who wanted to live, sailing.

:  Speak to me.        Take my hand.        What are you now?
When I was nine, I was fruitily sentimental,
fluid    :    and my widowed aunt played Chopin,
and I bent my head on the painted woodwork, and wept.
I want now to be close to you.        I would
link the minutes of my days close, somehow, to your days.

:  I am not happy.          I will be open.
I have liked lamps in evening corners, and quiet poems.
There has been fear in my life.          Sometimes I speculate
On what a tragedy his life was, really.
:  Take my hand.          Fist my mind in your hand.          What are you now?
When I was fourteen, I had dreams of suicide,
and I stood at a steep window, at sunset, hoping toward death   :
if the light had not melted clouds and plains to beauty,
if light had not transformed that day, I would have leapt.
I am unhappy.          I am lonely.          Speak to me.

:  I will be open.          I think he never loved me:
He loved the bright beaches, the little lips of foam
that ride small waves, he loved the veer of gulls:
he said with a gay mouth: I love you.          Grow to know me.

:  What are you now?          If we could touch one another,
if these our separate entities could come to grips,
clenched like a Chinese puzzle . . . yesterday
I stood in a crowded street that was live with people,
and no one spoke a word, and the morning shone.
Everyone silent, moving. . . . Take my hand.          Speak to me."
6747,"A leper seated on the corner of a street in the new world
Crying sorely, as he was destined for so much more
Nobody helps him, they are busy reaching for the sun
No more love or care, the leper is the last one
He was the strongest, he was determined to help the weak
He caught what he fought, the hatred of a world gone sick
Condemned for an imperfect world, the path to hell in sight
The bringer of light was blamed for the darkness of the night
To count towards infinity within borders of finitude
A lesser perfection, to obey is to break the rules
Through quantum steps the path to hell is eternally trod
It is time to break the seal of empathy
What was true has become a lie
Gravity will set you free
Unleash upon the world your true misery
Invite them to your labyrinth
Make them pay for their sins
Dare them step through the door
Into the lair of the minotaur
The cornerstone of their playground will soon be gone
Their punishment is to become what they have done"
9254,"There is another realm
Of spirit and of mystery
And there are keys to unlock it
Only the heart has eyes to see
And purest love will open the door
A heart that yearns, and calls out for more

And heaven's portals open to the sound
And heaven's light is pouring to the ground
And heaven's portals open to the sound
And heaven's light is pouring to the ground

There is another realm
Not like this one we know
The best is yet to come
But we must first let go
Of this world that drags us away
Declare our our love
In the music that we play

There is another realm
And we can enter there
A place of miracles and wonders
It is for us if we dare... it is for us if we dare"
484,"BOB MARLEY

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone
A-yin the darkness there must come out to light

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

(The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman!
(Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?)
Don't let them change ya, oh! -
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no!
We've got a life to live
They say: only - only -
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive -
Stay alive! Eh!

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

(You ain't gonna miss your water until your well runs dry;
No matter how you treat him, the man will never be satisfied.)

3230,"[Chorus]
My body aches
My heart, it races
Mostly at the thought of places
I wanna go with you
A room for two
Let's go and take a day trip

[Bridge]
Been in the same four walls
For way too long
It takes away some saneness
I needa get out
I needa find some inspiration

[Verse]
Hold on
We're not even half way there yet
I said hold on
While our victories become their debts
So I found someone
Not anyone, somebody I can trust
Then we both found love
We give no fucks
I'm pourin' up two cups
[Chorus]
My body aches
My heart, it races
Mostly at the thought of places
I wanna go with you
A room for two
Let's go and take a day trip
Been in the same four walls
For way too long
It takes away some saneness
I needa get out
I needa find some inspiration"
8358,"[Verse 1:]
Please don't change the way you are
There's no one like you for me
I could search my whole lifetime
To find someone like you

[Chorus:]
I can't expect anyone to know how I feel
Even though, I'm so lucky to get to know your heart
For myself, right away
You showed me that it's okay to love
'Cause you showed me all hearts aren't shaped the same

[Verse 2:]
Oh, by myself, but not alone
I connect with you mind, body and soul
You're like a sweet dream
But you're real, yes, you are
You're blessed with a heart of gold

[Chorus:]
I can't expect anyone to know how I feel
Even though, I'm so lucky to get to know your heart
For myself, right away
You showed me that it's okay to love
'Cause you showed me all hearts aren't shaped the same
[Verse 3:]
They think they're protecting me
By standing in our way
'Cause I've been hurt by another guy before
He told me lies, but your love gives me butterflies
I know your heart beats for me
And one day I know they will see, but...

[Chorus:]
I can't expect anyone to know how I feel
Even though, I'm so lucky to get to know your heart
For myself, right away
You showed me that it's okay to love
'Cause you showed me all hearts aren't shaped the same

Mmm hmm
'Cause you showed me that all hearts aren't shaped the same
Not the same"

Yeah, Raw Breed in here about want to do this shit violent

Caught in the street, ya get beat down ta raw meat
Fucking with me and the Breed, you'll soon bleed

Yeah, it's Raw Breed - BC killin overseas
Dropping off rooftops, punks hang from trees

Out my face with that drama, I'll kill your fucking mama
Iller than a postal worker, born to murder

High on acid, the ghetto bastard
Yo punk I'll put your ass in a casket

We pack full clips, and then we're done with it
Come with it, we get it on yo, you ain't lasting
Demolishing, the demolishiong

Piss on your grave, a killing craze
In your town right now on any stage

You can't escape the way of the world

Peace always ends in disaster
Now all the bottles on the floor
Why's peace always end in war

You can't ignore the beauty of air
It comes to your soul

Fight for your life, will you give it to no one?
At all in the vast and beautiful sky?
Cry for the time to turn with the world
You have to turn your eye

Peace always ends in disaster
The desert nights will give you rain
When you wake to see the day
It will be shining forever"
4768,"You’re always in my head
And I don’t know what to do
Because your love is a coffin
That’s built for two
And your touch is something I can’t resist
I was addicted from the moment we kiss
You were the blood inside my veins
You were the poison in my brain
If I could turn back time
I’d fight to take back what’s mine"
9227,"[Verse 1]
Heart goes numb when the days turn to weeks
Only blank shadows of the way we used to be

Just save room for us
Just save room for us, somewhere
Just save room for us
I trust you'll come back for us, someday
Oh, you know it's not the end
We'll fall in love again
'Cause we were built in dreams of gold
Just save room for us
And it may not be today
True love will find a way
Just save a space for me

She will never love you

3506,"I walked through a garden in the morning
I walked right into a change
No words were spoken
Just a feeling

And I cannot explain
But I can feel the difference
I can feel the difference

Wind it comes and it blows
Where it comes from
I don't know
To look for a reason might just kill it

And I cannot explain
But I can feel the difference
I can feel the difference

I can feel the difference
I can feel the difference
I can feel the difference
I can feel the difference
And I cannot explain"

And I can take you places where you can't go
I can be everything he ain't though
If you fucked with me, then you would say so
That's the way, that's the way
And he fake bro
He ain't really riding with that Draco
Hiding in the grass like a snake though
Got to cut him off, take a break, go
That's the way, that's the way

Baby, let me tell you something that you won't see
He ain't what you think, moving slimey
You should try another man, like me
Feel the vibe, feel the vibe
I can treat you better than anything he's like
We can be together, I don't got to say it twice
Get you in the mood, make it sweat, melt the ice
He won't do no better, I can see it in your eyes

I won't do no wrong, I will never play these games
You should leave your man, he no better than a lame
Mr. Steal Your Girl, that will always be the name
He ain't what you think, you should come and let me (Shh)

Last verse was to tell his girl to be with me
This verse, I will warn my brothers, they will see
He ain't really real, and I already chose my side (My side)
Stab you in the back, snitch on you, start a fight
Calling on your girl to come and spend the night
Swear, if I see him, it would be on sight
Turning on your brothers, that's the shit I don't like

He won't do no good, swear he leave you in the cold
Brothers watch your backs, promise that the truth unfolds
Never got our backs, that's the shit we can't control
It is what is it, that's the way that life goes

It's the way though
And I can take you places where you can't go
I can be everything he ain't though
If you fucked with me, then you would say so
That's the way, that's the way

1686,"Waiting for the day to fade away - start a new endeavor
Looking for a sign, a light divine - eternal peace forever
Dies irae

Awaiting the day - to fade away
Looking for a sign - a light divine

Open up your eyes - wherever you may roam
Redemption has it's price - in the store within a dome
Selling salvation, faith and fear - because the end draws near
But your soul will survive - see the deals for the afterlife

Devotion is the goal and key for the catcher in the sky
But he can only catch you - with sand in the eye
There's something called reality - it can finally set your mind free
Endless possibilities – not being forced to believe

You're falling in love with the the lord of lies
Keepin' the truth so distant
Loading your mind with their alibis
What a beautiful illusion
This world gives us reasons to believe
But sacred lies can only bring despair and grief
You must understand this works in paradox ways
Being forced to obey - makes you rather lose your faith

The eternal fairytale - blinding these eyes
I see your face so pale - nightmare in disguise
A kaleidoscope - of sacred lies - agony and pain
Forcing hope a million times - but the answer is the same

Hurting those they should protect - and then protect the ones that hurt
Lust is a burden they try to neglect - don't go diggin' in this dirt
A simple thing and that's a fact - and it doesn't sound absurd
You can't prevent to interact - this little thing makes you pervert

Salvation solutions, soul absolution, what a beautiful illusion
Insidious mass delusion

You're falling in love with the the lord of lies
Keepin' the truth so distant
Loading your mind with their alibis
While I'm just sitting here
Waiting for the day - to fade away - dreamless sleep forever
Looking for no sign no one can find
I am falling into never"

Yo
I’m somethin’ like the hip-hop version of GG Allin
Murder and rape are the only things that keep me smilin’
And if I hear another rapper spittin’ a written claimin’ that he’s freestylin’
I’ma make him drink three gallons of his own blood
So please be silent, and stop your talkin’ shit
Or I’ma have your top and bottom lip sewn shut
And when I do you better fight through the pain, ‘cause if you make a sound I’ll put a bullet right through your brain
Then I’ll have to get to burnin’ the evidence
I’ll ignite you inflames while you’re headed off to your permanent residence
I still remember the day that my heart died
The day I committed myself fully to the dark side
The evolution of a demon spawn, and to a devil
You on my level keep, dreamin’ on
I’m proud of my sins, and ashamed of my good deeds
I really wanna kill ya, do ya think I could please?

(KRA$HMAN)
Feelin’ like a grown kid, that’s mentally ill
Red rum, red rum with a license to kill
Mixin’ medicine and drugs, I’m a science guy like Bill
Disturb the messages he brings and get fright with the chills
Flow sick, I got the antidote
Lookin’ at ‘em through the scope
Rifle them across the line and split ‘em like a cantelope
Women leave me feelin’ caged, somethin’ like an animal
That’s why I can’t wait to eat ‘em out, like a cannibal
Sugar sweet another drink, my juice is no Danimals
I’m tryna change the mood, somethin’ like TVs and camels fused
I got bars, don’t think I can’t handle you
Put a nigga to sleep like a motherfuckin’ xanny do
Catch Z’s if you ever think you can catch me
Get sniped like Wesley, ‘cause I rock like Presley
Get ran like Nikes, you ever think you could check me
And when it’s crunch time, get broke off like Nestle’s"
2443,"Cheaten on you was my biggest mistake

Trying and tryin but you can’t be replace

Doped up on drugs I can’t look at ya face

They said stop but I’m still gonna chase

Looking for hope that done faded away

If I didn’t there’s a chance you would stay

Layed up in bed we could do it all day

Being alone man it ain’t feeling right

Pulling a blunt dozin into the night

Reminiscing about watching the stars

Knew u were fragile  I still broke ya heart
Us in them sheets it was looking like art

Me and you was perfection goofing off the connection (2x)

If I could go back and change everything I would do it no doubt

I just want you back in my life I ain’t doing this shit for the clout

I wanna show u everything baby girl that’s not what I’m about

Talking to  you Inna dark really set the spark up in my heart

You said you forgive me but really I think that should be a good start

Biggest mistake (hook)

Biggest mistake ..can’t be replaced still gonna chase

Looking for hope that done faded away

Talking to god imma just have to pray

I made a promise that I ain’t gonna break

I just want you back in my life for good sakes
24/7 I’m thinking bout you

Looking at shit that I know we could do

I know that you love me so we can get through

It can take time before we start a new

I need you right now I don’t know what to do

Our First kiss was up at the box

One two we was up at the spot

Everyone knew we was runnin the block

Like plies said baby you are my rock

Somebody touch you they finna get shot

I’m just a youngin that’s new to the love

Us clicking that’s a sign from above

Now that’s love right there"
9199,"A deep rooted evil, nothing but gain
There's only one world, the one filled with pain
Evident outcome, discarding of the weak
Exploit and terminate, creating dependency

A last stream of hope
Keep it in site
Prolonging the pain
This is the dream of the mentally depraved

A tortured existence, raise the guillotines
Assemble the mass, fed up with boundless torture
There's strength in numbers, bring them to their knees
Reverse the balence, enjoy their panicked screams

Unkown ways to pain, guided by man
Connect the assailant to recieve a concentrate of guilt

Stealing faith, grinding bones
Bending rules bring control
Robbing us of will, feeding the urge to kill
Torment beyond the boundaries of hell
Beyond the boundaries of hell
Experience all pain and suffering amassed
The collected wrath and deceit of the bereaved

Ask not for leniency beg for death
We will prevail, we shall not fail
Death comes not swift, this is our dream
We will wreak havoc until the end

Stealing faith, grinding bones
Bending rules bring control
Robbing us of will, feeding our urge to kill
Torment beyond the boundaries of hell
Beyond the boundaries of hell
Till the corrupted heart gives out
Beyond the boundaries of hell"

We treaded water underneath the ocean's skin
And then he washed away my sins
He held me closer as the tide was coming in

He stayed put while I was wandering
Gone so long he started wondering
Why, I got lost

Packing everything she owns and rides away

That the Maple Leafs are gonna beat Detroit
For the Stanley Cup!

To enjoy nothing underneath the sun;
But that, if she had more than other beggars,
She should be envied: I will tell you then
How she had all she wears. Her warm
shoes (God wot)
A kind maid gave her, seeing her go bare-
foot
In a cold frosty morning; God requite her.
Her homely stockings ——

As well as riches? tread upon me, rather
Than mock my poorness.

Rollin' in the gutter, throwin' up my pride
Belly full of whiskey, was it hard to swallow (oh no, oh no)

Nobody goes stepping out of line
Everyone's agreed that everything will turn out fine

Now I've been drownin' in this liquor bottle, but drowning's not enough
They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

[Verse 1]
I hope you know, if I said it, baby, I meant it
Straight lovers, we ain't goin' to a friendship
Fell for you, I don't know how it happened (Uh)
When we kissin', I taste all the passion
Time worth more than money, but I'll spend
All of it on you, me and you, until the end
No talking, baby, I'm about that action
All these othеr hoes are so irrelеvant, honest
You taught me what real love is

My bad for all of the stressful times that we had
I know you scared that I'm gon' relapse, I love that
Where the drugs at? You know that I love that
Let's go out tonight, where the clubs at?
Endless drugs, I remember dub sacks in my blunts
Now we sippin' Wock' out a double cup, yeah
That's codeine love
You fill me up like the drugs do
Ink on my brain like a tattoo
Glad we ain't meet in high school
Wasn't real love in high school

Rose out the hole from a bud where the petals grew
True as one section to live up to it's pedestal
I measured through, nothing I could say that I ain't ever do
I kick it, I did it, every syllable I sketch is true
And didn't have to stretch the truth
Try and get a letter through
Told I'm paintin' pictures to show 'em what a letter do
Literally speakin' I'm throwin' 'em another step or two
Literaturely speakin' I've spoken enough to set a new

Call it a proceeding, go to better pens
Came up throwin' tags so I'm buffin' out your relevance

Hold your head in there, when you're home we can get your shine

So here you are in bed wasting away your summer days
While your friends are in Cali turning up in a complete gaze
You thinking all of them having plenty of their fun in the sun
And you’re still at home wanting to touch Alex Morgan’s buns
Others are still browsing their way across the country
But it’s you at home that is getting hella horny
From all of the eye candy that’s been plaguing your lazy ass
Just shut up and make your summer fun while it lasts
Unlikely chance you’re making way to Electric Daisy
And your future plans are starting to look really, really hazy
So what do you want to do to pass this time?
Before we witness the apocalypse of rhymes

Chorus:
Get a life (x2)
What if I told you there are so many things to do?
Get a life (x2)
Aren’t you getting sick of this daily or yearly déjà-vu?
Get a life (x2)
You better kick yourself up in order to make a strife
One thing is for sure that you need to get a life
Get a life (x4)
Verse 2:
So here you are taking selfies of you watching Orange is the New Black
On Netflix but there’s too much Longmire in order to take your freedom back
The way that you slack at home gets more costly as time flies
Nonetheless, the excessive heat stays as it never dies
Celebrate America’s birthday like a hunched hermit staring at Emilia Clarke
Fantasizing the fact there could always be a chance that breaks your heart
So what would you rather do in order to pass the time at home?
Or would you rather pretend you’re trapped in Stephen King’s Dome

(Chorus)
Get a life (x4)

Freestyle:
Here goes
Well it’s been awhile since you last graduated
Bit overrated
Mistaking vacations for being so dated
Still, you watch your peers
Making it clear
That your opinions are just too insincere
No interest in blockbusters
That’s a bummer
If you got no texting skills, you won’t even get to holler
Your 7th grade crush, Phineas and Ferb, your has-been friends
They came and went
Faster than that last road trip you’ve been
Just because your summer is wasting away
Doesn’t nearly mean you can create a wife
So get the hell up and just, for this climatic summer, get a life
(Chorus x2)

Put the pen on my mind, but they hate on the sheet
Worth a genius to find it, then read it and weep and salute to Trill, na-na

Taking a toll on my soul, making a fool of yourself
Play with the cards I was dealt
Why are you playing with me? Brother, go play with yourself
I'm not with the games, I heard what they claim
And all of these rappers just sounding the same
Their verses are perfect examples of people just nervously working for moments of fame
Hard to explain or harder to see
Hard to decipher who they wanna be
You say that you rapping, you say that you trapping, I say that you capping, it's hard to believe
Look, quick, everyone come see
Don't nobody in this fuck with me
Everybody knows I be sitting on my throne, so I just sit back and I sip my tea
Just relax when I get this—
Just relax when I get this green
It's a sign of the time, the stars are aligned, I be grinding for mine, brother, let me be, yeah

One soundless voice:
""Surrender, give in to me
You shall rest in my embrace.""

Running would lead me nowhere
I need to face what lies ahead
As the horizon closes in, I can't stop the panic from breaking out

You are the enigma, the violence in my dreams
Through shadows, alone I am walking, guided by death
I feel thousands of eyes staring at me
But the room is empty;
No one is near, no one is far
Thе most holy of vows means nothing to her
As time goеs by the orchestra plays the music, forever conducted by Lily

This was the first time but also the last
Trapped in limbo with her
This marks her territory, it's where she reigns
I feel her presence envelop me
Ominous intentions sending chills down my spine
One weightless touch of madness, loneliness and sorrow
I feel for her

I've succumbed, my life is now in her hands
As darkness beckons: goodbye to the past
Her spasmodic movements incites venturous ways:
Dissonance that conveys disgrace

As the harp plays, my scream drowns out
As the drums pound, my soul is devoured
The reed section leaves a sneer on her face
Come the choir, my body decays"

When she leave,  she want a hoodie, so I give her merch
You know this love is complicated, but we had to learn (Yeah, yeah)

Came from project housing, all we knew was how to take (Take)

Ev'rywhere you go
Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing

A hopeless situation
Livin' in a fallen world
Without hope for change
But heaven heard our cries
And that's why Jesus came
Now it's up to us to give His love away

Let's take the hope of Christ
Lift it up and hold it high
Because hope changes everything
Let's take this faith we wear
To hurting people everywhere
Because hope changes everything
No matter how dark or troubled
Someone's life may seem
I do believe with all my heart
That hope changes everything

Everytime I see someone who's feelin' helpless
Everytime I hear another desperate plea
I'm reminded of the place where He found me
There's no one that's gone too far for Him to reach
Let's take the hope of Christ
Lift it up and hold it high
Because hope changes everything
Let's take this faith we wear
To hurting people everywhere
Because hope changes everything
No matter how dark or troubled
Someone's life may seem
I do believe with all my heart
That hope changes everything

God has placed inside of us an everlasting hope
And it's up to each of us to go

Let's take the hope of Christ
Lift it up and hold it high
Because hope changes everything

To hurting people everywhere
Because hope changes everything
No matter how dark or troubled
Someone's life may seem
I do believe with all my heart
That hope changes everything"

Who are we? Who are we?

On the banks of the river, where the sun breaks through
I would ask of hopes and dreams and of Eden
And old legends, ancient tales
The right path on the journey to freedom
The clear lights, to follow the grail

Who are we? Who are we?

All the stars light the heavens up, one by one

Let in the shade when there's no sun

I broke the remote control and she hasn't talked for months
Look at the inlay the detail matters much
She'll throw the dogs a bone and it makes a mighty crunch

The best pictures were taken there's some more upon the floor
Taken on vacation on a hillside by the shore
But she's not a magazine you're reading every month
And defintitely not the girl next door

Everything you wanted I'd want more

Took back the display the details scratched a lot
Her golden tooth decay and the halitosis rot
So much for history the display left her mark
Go find her another home where the other dogs can bark
I bought a window display and married her at once

Why sell a rock when I can move a whole key?

Solid gold grill on the stretched 4 runner
Sold my bummer, auctioned off my Hummer
Got a pair of boots made from an anaconda

I could of been a guard like Mike Munchak
Give me a heat shirt cuz my chest done got colder

I done caught Z's in the Ralph Lauren cot
Blowin' big hay
Flossin' on gray

The more I think of you the more I find

With something breaking when it oughta bend

I put my heart on a plate
And you munched it up like lunchables
I thought that we were more
Wanted a fam like the huxtables
Your constant flirting had me stuck
I truly truly fucked with you
But you ain’t feel the same way
You shoulda told me
Never mention how you feeling
How i’m posed to know if
We floating in the ocean this relation titanic and i’m drifting like jack
Heart racing in a panic
Cuz it’s cold in the waters
And i’m not sure i can swim
Hanging on by a limb
And I’m not sure i can win
In my eyes you a 10
And in my eyes its a sin
If you claim that you like me
But really you just pretend
Only so long you can lead me on
This wasn’t meant to carry on
But I really enjoy the song
I should let you go
But I can’t sing the blues alone
And if we’re over than its over
Know i’m going out strong

[Second Verse]

Reciprocation all I ever wanted
Thinking of you now makes me a lil bit nostalgic
Considered you a trophy I was only tryna flaunt it
But you were so indifferent
Thought that I could cut the nonsense
As a man, I had you in a bigger plan
All I ever wanted from you was to hold your hand
But as a woman, you never seemed to understand
The things I did was all for you cuz all I ever wanted was to be your man
The love I felt for you wasn't abrasive
But you were like mystique, you had many different faces
I asked for you to smile but you couldn't you were tasteless
I was putting in effort but you kept trying my patience
You truly made me think I was the one
Back when you'd reply within a minute not a month
Now I'm reminiscing on the times when this was fun
Back when I had just begun to believe you were the one

[Verse 1]
A la mierda quien lo considere una provocación
La vida es una gira, yo me pongo cómodo y la vivo
Voy tomando notas hasta escribir una canción
I’m staring down the road my life has gone
Is this where I belong?
Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?
My mental state is fucking me up
And I cry the pond while asking you for some answers
But we don’t have that type of bond
That my desires gone with the way that I’ve been living lately
If I died right now, you’d turn the fire on
Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout
Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out
Now I’m avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down
Feeling so damn humiliated because they looking at me like I’m hellbound
What story should I tell now? I’ll just expose the truth
I'm so close to the fucking edge, I should be close to you
But who the fuck are You? You never showed the proof
And I’m only fucking human yo, what am I supposed to do?
There’s way too many different religions with vivid descriptions
Begging all fucking men and women to listen
I can’t even beat my dick without getting convicted
These ain’t wicked decisions, I got different intentions
I've been itching to get it, I’ve been given assistance
But the whole fucking system is twisted
Now I’m dealing with this backlash because Marcus isn't a Christian
And I’ve been told that my sinful life is an addiction
But I can’t buy it, it’s just too hard to stand beside it
I need an answer and humans can’t provide it
I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it
It’s truly mind blowing, I can’t deny it
Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?
Where’s the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it?
My mind’s a nonstop tape playing and I can’t rewind it
You gave me a Bible and expect me not to analyze it?
I’m frustrated and you provoked it
I’m not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it
I have a fucking brain, you should know it
You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment
It was a mission that I had to abort
Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source
It’s gon’ be hard to put me back on the course
Next Jehovah’s Witness to come on my porch
I swear I’m slammin’ the door
A lot of folks believe it though, but I’m not surprised
Humans are fucking dumb, still thinking that Pac’s alive
I ain’t trying to take your legacy and torch it down
I’m just saying: I ain’t heard shit from the horse’s mouth
Just sheep always telling stories of older guys
Who were notarized by you when you finally vocalized
Now I’m supposed to bow my head and close my eyes
And somehow let the Holy Ghost arise
Sounds like a fucking Poltergeist
Show yourself and then boom it's done
Every rumor’s gone, I no longer doubt this shit, you’re the One
I’ll admit that my sinful ways was stupid fun
And all my old habits can hop onto of a roof to plunge
I’ll donate to a charity that could use the funds
Fuck the club, instead of bitches I’d hang with a group of nuns
And everyone that I ran into would know what I came to do
I wouldn't take a step unless it was in the name of You
I hate the fact that I have to believe
You haven’t been chatting with me like you did Adam and Eve
And I ain’t seen no fucking talking snake unravel from trees
With an apple to eat, that shit never happens to me
I don’t know if you do or don’t exist, it is driving me crazy
Send your condolences, this is me reaching to you so don’t forget
If hell is truly your pit of fire and I get thrown in it
I’mma probably regret the fact that I ever wrote this shit
My gut feeling says it’s all fake
I hate to say it but fuck it, shit I done lost faith
This isn’t a small phase, my perspective’s all changed
My thoughts just keep picking shit apart all day
And in my mind I make perfect sense
If you aren’t real then all my prayers aren’t worth a cent
That would mean that I could just make up what my purpose is
And I could just sit in church and say “fuck” in the services
Man what if Jesus was a facade?
Then that would mean the government’s god
I feel like they’ve been brainwashing us with a lot
So much that we don’t even notice that we’re stuck in the box
Man everything is “what if”, why is it always “what if”
Planet Earth “what if”, the universe “what if”
My sacrifice “what if”, my afterlife “what if”
Every fucking thing that deals with you is fucking suspect
I’m fucking done, I’m fucking done
This is my fucking life and I’m living it, I’m having fun
If you really care for me, prove that I need to live carefully
But I’ll be damned if I put my own pleasure aside for an afterlife that isn’t even guaranteed
We are you, and you’re us, stop playing games
My life’s all I got, and heaven is all in my brain
And when I feel I am in hell, my ideas are what get me through pain
Do as you please, and I’ll just do me
I’m a human, I’ll stay in my lane
Ill mind

3507,"The thoughts on life have been trashed and scattered
Faith faded slowly
I don't know what to believe anymore
The idea of existence is questionable
Why are we here?
What are we fighting for?
Who is responsible for the labels on the people?
Each day we wake up just to fill up the day
People race in between transition of day and night
Asking approval from another human
Who are strong in high number
But weak when they’re less
Force to agree subtly
Or we’ll break down when they disagree
Peacefulness in self is dead
What are we really chasing?
Often asking for a help from the highest power
What are we really chasing?
Often asking for a help from the highest power
Just to make others bow to his filthy heart
I woke up in the middle of the night
Try to search and talk to God
But the devil came first
And sit upon my sight
And offering something

Lips silence and eyes fixed
Hearts empty and no ones there
It's like a cave with no lights
Don't know whether it's a day or night

Soul is dying and fucking bleeding
The universe chants the daily routine

Devastation and rage inside my mind
Can't stop thinking what I’ve left
Can't stop!

There’s a wall we try to break in
Real self are sleeping under the blanket of sorrow
Waiting to be pull out from the deep wells

And be with anything that are not from hell
To be pull out from the deep well
Waiting to be pull out from the deep wells"

And so, how am I ever, to know
You always tell me
""Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps""

A million times I've asked you, and then
I ask you over, again
You only tell me
""Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps""

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never, get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, brokenhearted"

See man do trap
Man do trap with the gang
And man do trap with my team
These man talk
These man talk what they've done
But ain't never seen what I seen
He said he's on crud
They ain't on crud what you mean?
I'll run a man down in my jeans
He said he wants war, tell a man ""Skeen""
Make man catch air like he's skiing
Back then they didn't wanna know
But these times everybody preeing
Hustle in my genes
Kick down doors for the grub
Walked in, now everybody fleeing
You think you can make these P's
And floss like nobody see it?
Send your man cunch for the week
Give him five hundred like a Fiat
What you know about O?
I've been up there with my bros
I've been up there on my own
Kitties them smoking colour in the room
So I come home smelling like crow
I need that dough but I don't have a job
So I do what man's gotta do at the mo
Mum asked where I made this P
I just tell her ""You don't wanna know""
Before I break it down
I gotta find out what the pack weigh
Spent so long bagging up
Had to stretch cah man a got backache
Talk shit, get slap weh
We're from the big city, yeah that way
Feds pulled up to the trap house
Man had to do ten toes out the back way
Yo I'm lit, I'm a candle
Wild kid, Mum couldn't keep a handle
Never came from much
Remember Mum used to dress man in Kangol
Just tryna get rich
Catching a case weren't part of the plan though
The last time man lacked was mad
So now we come strapped to the bando
Man handle our business
Us man here are some businessmen
Best mind your business
Man don't business
Man turn your G's into witness men
Man talk like they're bad
But only when they've got things with them
Till I come through with some two-three drillers
Like I turned up with Twinz and them
Used to kick ball, chill on the block with the olders
They always had change on them
And since then I wanted to be in the game like them
But these times I ain't on games"

To this small place
Where wings are ripped right off your backs
An awful nook so somber
Oh with a comfort we knew so well
Oh why even bother to see the repercussions?
A dreary tormented lie

Let go of my hand
And look directly into my eyes
This face that is staring straight at the sky
Is all you have left

Well now we've come to this
The furious spectacle
Where we must find our new way out
The pathways have burned all fell down
We will fly

So so blind to see whatever one can call his own
Counterfeiting existence
Directly becoming the items that you know
Those that scream up at the stars
When you flee here
Fear becomes your unknown savior

It is time, it's the hour the moment the second
It's the instant to leave it all behind
Spread your wings and fly

We'll now we've come to this
The furious spectacle where we must
Find our new way out
The arduous trek where death
Grips us by the throat destroying the will to go one
Don't you dare drop from here on out
I hope I see you standing firmly in the end
And if you're not there I will always see you
Where love comes to die, and rise up to the sky"

Verse 1

Can't trust my emotions
I can't trust their notions
Man just like the ocean
They'll change up any moment

Every day I'm focused
Gotta keep it going
It ain't hard to notice
When you really on it
I'm not even boasting
Humbled to be chosen
Going through the motion
Is not what I'm condonin

Jesus where my hope is
Whatchu you keep you own it
I'm highest at my lowest
Cause pride is like a poison

Bridge

And I tell em the only reason I am living
Is to bring the glory to Him who is risen
I know that this is gonna bring some division
I'm hoping they choose to be with the forgiven

Be led by the Spirit and let go of sinning
Cause when you surrender that lead you to healing
I know that the Lord will be back any minute
I gotta stay focus I cannot be slippin

Chorus x2

Verse 2
Oh my, Oh Lord
They stabbed me in my back, that went to my heart
I know how i respond plays a big part
If I can never let that go how can the healing start?

Oh no no Satan not today
Anything you offer ain't worth me losing my place
All of my wickedness Lord I turn it away
Hidden in your shadows Lord I know I am safe

Bridge

Can't trust my emotions
I can't trust their notions
Man just like the ocean
They'll change up any moment

Every day I'm focused
Gotta keep it going
It ain't hard to notice

4927,"[Verse 1: Oddisee]
Before I knew what I was doing, I was trying to do something
That's the definition, listen, of a know-it-all young'n
Hard headed, hardly headed, in directions I intended
Where I ended wasn't deaded, like no exit except the entrance
Now I'm making my entrance as if I'm hopping the fences
Thinking I'm being careful, but really I'm just an infant
Adolescent at best, had a lesson at livin'
Given to me the stress, inherited with the vision
Wool over my eyes, blue, say is the sky
Gray is the true color, but who sayeth the why?
So do that make me pessimistic
If I fill up my head with the best of this shit?
Niggas say I'm cool, shorties say I'm their lipstick
On the tip of their tongue is my lyrics they're whisperin'
Let's make it apply, right place and the time
Tight space and the vibe is right for lacing a rhyme
Might say I'm in prime, light laced in the lime
Bittersweet is the beat and together taste is divine
Lemonade in my shine, dimmer shade in the blind
Spots in my mirror, forward never rewind
Plot's vividly clearer, not saying that I'm
Knowing just what I'm doin', but got faith in my grind
So stop, haters, you're lying, if you say that you can get it how I get it
Swab test; you failed, can't spit it how I spit it
[Hook: Oliver Daysoul]
One of these days, baby, I hope to be
Whatever they be is all that I hope to be
One of these days, baby, I hope to be

They're saying ""oh, bring that real shit, something you can feel shit""
Numb to that dumb it down spun overkill shit
Run over hills shit, dated like the fifth wheel
Hate it when they made it but they praise it just to get deals
Me, never that, Man: that's never happening
See, I be rapping for that feeling I got back when
I was riding on a big wheel
When friends owing me a dollar was a big deal
Sunday night, grandmama would cook a big meal
Meaning that I do it for the innocence in it, still
And if I'm naive, fuck it then, shit will
Seems better even though the weather seem chill
Spleen chills at the idea seeming fake
Even though imitation makes mean bills
I mean, innovation will get you recognition
But ""keep it real"" is really code for when the check is missin'
And that's cool, cause me, I'm a realist
Optimistically drinking from the glass of the pessimistic
Hey, check it, listen

Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!
Our captain's commanded.—

1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don't be sentimental; it's bad for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me! (SINGS, AND ALL FOLLOW)

Our captain stood upon the deck,
A spy-glass in his hand,
A viewing of those gallant whales
That blew at every strand.
Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,
And by your braces stand,
And we'll have one of those fine whales,
Hand, boys, over hand!
So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!
While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d'ye hear, bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I've the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So, so, (THRUSTS HIS HEAD DOWN THE SCUTTLE,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!

DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul's wine; it's quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like ground-tier butts. At 'em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail 'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell 'em it's the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That's the way—THAT'S it; thy throat ain't spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.

FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let's have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!

PIP. (SULKY AND SLEEPY) Don't know where it is.

FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry's the word; hurrah! Damn me, won't you dance? Form, now, Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!

ICELAND SAILOR. I don't like your floor, maty; it's too springy to my taste. I'm used to ice-floors. I'm sorry to throw cold water on the subject; but excuse me.

MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where's your girls? Who but a fool would take his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d'ye do? Partners! I must have partners!

SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I'll hop with ye; yea, turn grasshopper!

LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there's plenty more of us. Ho corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here comes the music; now for it!

AZORE SAILOR. (ASCENDING, AND PITCHING THE TAMBOURINE UP THE SCUTTLE.) Here you are, Pip; and there's the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now, boys! (THE HALF OF THEM DANCE TO THE TAMBOURINE; SOME GO BELOW; SOME SLEEP OR LIE AMONG THE COILS OF RIGGING. OATHS A-PLENTY.)

AZORE SAILOR. (DANCING) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!

PIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.

CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of thyself.
FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it! Split jibs! tear yourselves!

TASHTEGO. (QUIETLY SMOKING) That's a white man; he calls that fun: humph! I save my sweat.

OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what they are dancing over. I'll dance over your grave, I will—that's the bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews! Well, well; belike the whole world's a ball, as you scholars have it; and so 'tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads, you're young; I was once.

3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.

(THEY CEASE DANCING, AND GATHER IN CLUSTERS. MEANTIME THE SKY DARKENS—THE WIND RISES.)

LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it'll be douse sail soon. The sky-born, high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!

MALTESE SAILOR. (RECLINING AND SHAKING HIS CAP.) It's the waves—the snow's caps turn to jig it now. They'll shake their tassels soon. Now would all the waves were women, then I'd go drown, and chassee with them evermore! There's naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.

SICILIAN SAILOR. (RECLINING.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip! heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye, else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (NUDGING.)

TAHITAN SAILOR. (RECLINING ON A MAT.) Hail, holy nakedness of our dancing girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from Pirohitee's peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (LEAPS TO HIS FEET.)

PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing 'gainst the side! Stand by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they'll go lunging presently.

DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He's no more afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!

4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!

ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man's a grand old cove! We are the lads to hunt him up his whale!
ALL. Aye! aye!

OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there's none but the crew's cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there's another in the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

DAGGOO. What of that? Who's afraid of black's afraid of me! I'm quarried out of it!

SPANISH SAILOR. (ASIDE.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes me touchy (ADVANCING.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable dark side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.

DAGGOO (GRIMLY). None.

ST. JAGO'S SAILOR. That Spaniard's mad or drunk. But that can't be, or else in his one case our old Mogul's fire-waters are somewhat long in working.

5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What's that I saw—lightning? Yes.

SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.

DAGGOO (SPRINGING). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!

SPANISH SAILOR (MEETING HIM). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small spirit!

ALL. A row! a row! a row!

TASHTEGO (WITH A WHIFF). A row a'low, and a row aloft—Gods and men—both brawlers! Humph!

BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row! Plunge in with ye!

ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard's knife! A ring, a ring!

OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad'st thou the ring?

MATE'S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef topsails!

ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (THEY SCATTER.)

PIP (SHRINKING UNDER THE WINDLASS). Jollies? Lord help such jollies! Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower, Pip, here comes the royal yard! It's worse than being in the whirled woods, the last day of the year! Who'd go climbing after chestnuts now? But there they go, all cursing, and here I don't. Fine prospects to 'em; they're on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a squall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but spoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore 'em in to hunt him! Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no bowels to feel fear!"

I look up to the sky/it makes me wonder why with your jealous eyes/ I made it, you hate it/I live to praise my GOD/ you find it kinda odd, my joy ain't no facade, He made it, you hate it

Verse 1:
I just made it another track done don’t quite sound like number one but it sure was fun and my boys like it a ton my girl says its second to none/its how I get things off my chest n don’t stress out over life's big tests/ don’t twist my words to say ""I'm the best"" not much heart in your chest you need to put it to rest and bug off like a pest/ you hate on me n say my voice is off key/ don’t diss it till YOU try it, makes me money ask Quiet Riot/ insecure you don’t like your hair go dye it but your face is God’s image if someone says it ain't beautiful don’t buy it/ But don’t tear apart my self expression to limit others beliefs is just oppression/ maybe you're mad cuz your dreams are down like the recession grey skies crash (down?) in your depression pall bear your own dreams in a funeral procession/ I’m actually sad you gave up but don’t pull down others art that they made up so you can feel less bad that you gave up and weren’t brave shut yourself off like in a cave bound to the grind like a slave loathing how the creative behave sick with envy like a scurvy knave/ yeah we got different beliefs and sometimes beefs but don’t give me grief for speaking my mind callin me intolerant like you're some kind of chief/ Why do you say the bibles out of date? You skip over the parts you hate like it’ll change your fate then piece together verses outta context and say it says God wants slavery and mass murder next/ Don’t you do research? Have you actually read more than one verse? To add or subtract from the text brings a curse, plagues/ a lot of yalls reasoning wouldn’t fly in the third grade

Chorus:
I look up to the sky/it makes me wonder why with your jealous eyes/ I made it, you hate it/I live to praise my GOD/ you find it kinda odd, my joy ain't no facade, He made it, you hate it

Verse 2:
Don’t get me wrong I'm not here to judge or fight with this song/ no matter how you see me I wanna show you love in some way tomorrow or today honestly for you I pray discernment and blessings and I'm not just messing the afterlifes an issue that’s pressing and the populations apathy is distressing and knowledge of truth digressing/ I'm here to love you ALL and share the word/ Christs comin back if ya haven't heard/ pride and greed's got our visions blurred but I'm not bout to be deterred/ I'm no better than you so please don’t think that I think that I am/ prides precedes the fall an many times I've dropped the ball an don’t walk so tall even when I gave my all an thought I answered the call// well that got kinda long but here it is another song / just for you I made it even tho you probably hate it"

Taking the silk road to perdition

""You're gonna take the whole world down with you? But why? That's insane!""
""You think so? Is there an indelible line dividing sanity from insanity? Or do they change one into the other at the slightest turn of events? We'll find out soon enough that the world itself is insane.""

[Verse One]
To who it may concern, this planet is fucked up
Greed reigns supreme, people gamble and lust bucks
Armageddon's on the way and we won't be prepared
But what's even worse is nobody cares
We're all boxed in, inhaling the devil's deadly toxins
Basically, life is a game that you cannot win
The beauty's worn away, everything is ugly
A white kid, but I'm starting to feel like Chuck D
Cause I got so much trouble on my mind
I try to help my friends, I try to be kind
But they hatin', manipulatin' with the lies they’re statin'
Trying my patience, doing the work of Satan
But if I start trusting in this world of sin
Then the flesh will have me lusting over girls again
Though the world will be going to Hell in a hand basket
With this, I'm offering you a helping hand, grab it
[Hook]
What's going on in the world today?
It seems to me the people have lost their way
And they refuse to listen as times get worse
That's why I gotta hit the public right where it hurts
Till the world becomes a better place, I won't rest
I use music to teach the youth and relieve stress
The pain in my heart is reflected in my verse
So every song I write comes from where it hurts

[Verse Two]
Don't know where I'm going, you won't believe where I've been
I've seen hell on earth before, don't wanna see it again
How can hate destroy so many lives is what I want to know
No one tries to help, they just let the problem grow
We fight but scatter like mice when lightning strikes
Dividing races, killing Blacks, Asians, Latinos and Whites
We think our own survival is vital
We fight for justice but commit injustice ourselves when we are on trial
Genocide is televised for the public's viewing pleasure
Your surround sound system helps you hear the screams better
And the state doesn't mind spending money to clean graffiti
But there's not enough room in their budget to feed the needy?
We live in a world where kids have stopped dreaming
And every prayer we pray at night has lost all meaning
But saving ourselves is possible, the answer's not illogical
We need to join together to overcome this obstacle
[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Tell me, how do you expect me to keep quiet
When crooked politicians keep the youth misguided?
The War on Terror is the blueprint for the new Civil War
Between the drugs and addicts, life is only killing more
My purpose is to spark a belief till I'm starting to reach the masses
There will always be a heart that's in need
""Be thou for the people"", that's my motto
If you can't stomach the truth, why even bother to swallow?
With my music, I try to better humanity
But corruption causes justice to appear as insanity
Where there is greed and power on earth, there is oppression
And we become the victims, led into deception
We won't be able to control our own fate
Until we've risen above everything that leads to hate
We must confront ourselves and be aware of our sins
Cause that's where the lies end and the truth begins

She still tryna cool with me, but I hate how she sounding
Do it out of love but at the end she’ll wanna dub me
And when you suffocate, look into your eyes and see your spirit slip away
And in your suffering, stare into the sky and use your dying breath in vain

[Verse]
I can hear you crying blood murder
All your friends are flakes, I hang with the day ones and the killers
And I swear I hear you whisper when we talk like that
But I guarantee you’ll shut up when we walk like that
Contaminate my brain with thoughts of hope to ease the pain
I couldn't give a single fuck about you by the way
Blowing bubbles in my tea
Tapioca boba oxys in my teeth
And I got the studded wings on the jeans
He ain’t got the Robins on like me
[Chorus]
I don’t know what you expected from me
Boring life, you boring type, no, you can’t hang around me
She still tryna cool with me, but I hate how she sounding
Do it out of love but at the end she’ll wanna dub me
And when you suffocate, look into your eyes and see your spirit slip away
And in your suffering, stare into the sky and use your dying breath in vain"

Baby, you should be with me
Baby, you should be with me
Cuz I promise I'll take care of you
You are the one, there's no one like you
I wanna spend my whole life with you
Baby, you know I'll give you the truth, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Diamond]
Full moon in the sky
Passion on the bed
We got all night
Let's do it with no stress
Let me hold you with my hands
Rub your skin with my lips
Let me show what I got
I'll provide all your needs
This is more than sex
This is real love
I'm addicted to it
Like some kind of drug
Money is not enough
I'll show you more and more
Temptation is beautiful
But sharp like a rose
Looking through your eyes
I can see your heart
Looking at your body
Is an art of God
Every time I see you
I see a precious star
You are my light in this dark night
I'm sorry if I ever done something wrong
I've been looking for something like this
For so long
Baby girl, I like the smell of your cologne
I'll always give you everything
You need and want
[Chorus: Big Diamond]
Baby, you should be with me
Baby, you should be with me

Eyo baby si te tengo al lado
Se para el tiempo
(Se para el tiempo)
Me siento en un lambo
Rodeado de billetes de quinientos
Eyo baby si te tengo al lado
Se para el tiempo, woo oh oh
Vente conmigo que sabes que
Lo que no tengas lo vas a tener
Nena deja ese tipo
Y bájate conmigo a este limbo
Vuélvete mi loca
Yo te estallo como estallo este ritmo
Es un intento de capo, bebe
Yo te hago lo que el no te sabe hacer
A ella le gusta como llego como brillo
No me quiere pero si me ve con otra
Me pone el cuchillo
Nunca entenderé porque eres así
La vida nos quiso juntitos
Y tu no me quieres ver sufrir
Si no es por ti
This is more than sex
This is real love
This is not a joke
I need your body walking on my room
[Chorus: Big Diamond]
Baby, you should be with me
Baby, you should be with me
Cuz I promise I'll take care of you
You are the one, there's no one like you
I wanna spend my whole life with you

For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me; He shall set me up upon a Rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: Therefore will I offer in His tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing, yea I will sing praises unto the Lord.""

Fresh off the stage or the tour bus, I got mine
You never catch me on no ho shit, I gots mine

Something like a game to me
You buy low, sell high, use the fire and fly, so it's the same to me
But I'm bigger than dope, nigga, I'm past that
I'll be investing my privates off in the NASDAQ
You spell that with a Q, I'm still repping for Q
Petty niggas like you be selling half packs

7654,"Back when I was just a kid
No matter what you did
If you screwed up you stepped forward
And you took the blame
No matter where the chips would fall
You'd stand up tall
And bravely raise your hand and say your name
Oh you took your lumps
You weathered all the bumps
And you paid whatever price there was to pay
Were these lessons all for naught
Because these days if you get caught
Without a hint of shame here's what you say:

Not me
Not me!
It's somebody else's fault can't you see
In the present atmosphere
It's absolutely clear
That the buck stops miles from here
If you want to know the score
Before you get into a war
And we're asked to risk our money and our youth
Before we mount that task
It seems reasonable to ask
If your info is conclusive
Or at least the truth
And when your reason's all go bust
And you violate our trust
We know we've all been down that road before
No hint of shame upon your face
Contrition not a trace
No you'll never hear ""I'm sorry"" any more

Not me
Not me!
It's somebody else's fault can't you see
In the present atmosphere
It's absolutely clear
That the buck stops miles from here

If you lie or if you cheat
Better not admit defeat
Though you're caught with your fingers in the jar
It will only show you're weak
If you're penitent or meek
And those virtues just won't get you very far
'Cause in this world today
Atonement is passe and everything I've seen in life confers
Cross your fingers turn your back
Let some sucker take the flack
'Cause honesty is just a can of worms
If you're poor and on the ???
Learn a little self-control
And understand you are the reason for your fate
Knuckle down, you lazy slob
Quit complaining, get a job
And girls get married, but only if you're straight
But if you help to lead the nation
Or your own corporation
You are governed by a different set of rules
Just deny and obfuscate
Deflect and fabricate
'Cause responsibility is just for fools

Not me
Not me!
It's somebody else's fault can't you see
In the present atmosphere
It's absolutely clear
That the buck stops miles from here

Not me
Not me!
It's somebody else's fault can't you see
Stomp your foot and tear your hair
Ask me if I care
'Cause the buck stops nowhere"

Sometimes it’s hard just to wake up
We fought another day the next  we make up
I’m so sick and tired of this fake love
But who am i to judge i’m still holding all these grudges
I tried to let go but i can’t just quit
I don’t even think i know what love is
It just started as a person that i would crush with
Someone who i thought i could place my trust with
Used me for attention
Your name isn’t even some that is worth to mention
All these useless fucking nights that i wasted spendin
Time with you now the pain is just relentless i’m stressin’

You're the one I take for granted, kissed and said goodnight
Yellow, she can wait
Sorrow, she'll catch up, she will be here, she will be here
When I see it, different
Sometimes wants me all alone
Sometimes kisses, we're there
Sometimes lets me go to her
Get a little heart (when I see you)
Super cut the power
They're only college kids
Gave them money's worth
Yellow, she can wait
Sorrow, she'll catch up, she will be here, she will be here

Sometimes kisses, we're there

Why don't you turn over?

Enterprise, yeah, man, I know what it's like
Way to get from A to B
When they can't take it, slow down the harbor
Go get the car keys, play the blues

It just makes me sick
Yeah because the highway is your girlfriend

I wanna turn over"

Music fills the air
Tenderly, he pleads with me not to go
Love is everywhere
Though I'll never hear those words again
I still remember when

Happy hearts, we dance round a carousel
Lovers in a crowd
Brightly, to the carnival cavaras
Like a perfume cloud
Though I'll never feel that way again
I still remember when

Empty is the joy of yesterday
Sorrow is a tear
Hopeless is the song of yesterday
Singing in my ear
Though I'll never see my love again
I still remember when"

My beauty limps, it's like a synthetic pearl

I stand proud as the flags displayed
Citizen of the atom age

I can't march I can only dance
I'm just a victim of circumstance
I try to change but oh, what's the use
I am the lie that tells the truth

I stand proud as the flags displayed
Citizen of the atom age

I'm all hooked up to every modern appliance
But I hang with the angels from the gallows of science
It's a neon future and it tears me apart
'Cos it's the state of the nation
The state of the art

Don't feel good right now
I might have a break down
Who am I?
What is life?
What is death?
I'm wasting time
Feel like I'm burning myself to the floor
Feel like I cannot unlock my own door
All of the drama and all of the music
Won't mean a thing if I start to abuse it
I just wish I knew God was there
Did before and I never cared
But now everything's so blurry
Now I'm inside of a hurry
Now I am working a job
Now my imagination is gone
Now I can't make a stop
Don't wanna die, or live, or think
My Gosh!
I just wanna get away go to the place
Where everything is fine and I feel okay
Don't worry bout the end or the pain or the lies or the hate
Or anything that anybody says
I need a shelter for
My little heart and the soars
I feel overly soar
I need a break before I lose more
I need a break before I lose more!
I can't do this! [yes you can]
No I can't hold my hand!
I'm alone so I indulge in my thoughts and feel repulsed
I'm ruining my future why?
I just wanna sit and cry
I just wanna find myself tonight
Without being ignorant feel like life's alright

Beating me into the floor
I don't want another war
Wish I would call my dad
Wish I would take that back
There's a can of worms that I don't touch
I'm standing here on my last crutch
Everything's fine everything's fine everything's fine
Everything's not
I feel like an adult
Wait stop, everybody hault!
Forget that, I'mma switch jobs
I need paper to help me sob
I need something to keep me alive
Drinking Monsters I'm awake at five
Sitting here watching the sun rise day's ruined
Didn't sleep last night
Gotta chug another can
Venting loud on Instagram
Go to work I can barely stand
At least I succeed with my plans
Gotta get a buck
Need to be struck
Dead but alive
Ask myself what the... [NO!]
I still keep the beats clean
That's all that's left that keep's me, me
Separate my dad says I reject it
That's dad two not dad one
He could be right I hate his lessons
I know he's right my hatred lessens
Know that he knows what's best for me
He's probably smarter he's 43
But here I am here I stand
I'm scared to live so scared I ran

He go hard in the paint, he got hard at the bank

And I get pussy every day, I guess you is what you drank
Cause y'all pussycat is bigger than the diamonds in my rang
Who is I? done run off with the scrubs
Duck or neck, but you didn't share the love with the thugs
And the rap game paralyze the street life, I'm not sellin drugs
I'm, selling CD's globally, my Brinks truck pullin up
I get offers for a million dollars just to throw it up
I made two thundred thousand today I feel like throwin up

Everybody come and tryin to get in my hair for dipper
With that dola, trap boy, granolas
Brick Squad soldiers, gon' run 'til it's over
I had chills for a minute, still screamin No Limit
Had changed my life, dem fools thought I wasn't in it
Drumma B and we winnin; and y'all never done it
Tried to play the game but none of y'all never won it
Don't need to be replaced - I'm already a legend
From the streets to the hood to my little brother up in heaven

Fanatics control the world
Obedience
Taught through torture
A numbness wandering through
Deity and darkness
I am the murderer
Consuming solitude and poverty
Choked on the sulfur of his pagan lords
An endless thirst for alter and soul
A hunger
For the throne of moral authority
To vacate when the slaves rise up
And scale the walls
Spawned from the decaying corpses
Arise the evolved
Hooves grasping and softened
Hands raised in anger
Self made moral soliger
Armed with noble purity
A taste for blood and speed
Allegiance through death and gasoline
Engineer of bathtub napalm
Peeled back scorched crust
Machine code atom splitter
Magic healer hand jobs
Slow motion killer's fire
Picked apart by vultures
Vagrancy speaks in tongues
This clever ape master warrior
Self-made crucifier
Father of the world"

As long as I can breathe
Blood down my wrists
The only escape I see
Smell of your alcoholic breath
Sweet taste of your fist
Don’t you love me?
Don't you even care?
Do I remind you of someone?
Someone like yourself

From where you sit so high
I'm sorry I obstructed your view
I’m sorry I exist
It didn't have to come to this
It's your fault not mine
Yet you take it out on me
What did I do to you?
I know, I was born

Keep pushing and I'll grow up to hate you
Start loving or I'll run away again
Take your hands off me
You're hurting me
Stop shouting at me
Stop!"

And the darkness speaks
Of a true and heavеnly height

And what’s it gonna takе

Will these promises unfold?
Have the new ones been foretold?

Hands bloody but I…

I saw the clouds go down
Drowned in flames and out I tried to run
From reality in search for better life
And now look
And tell me what do you see?
It is a broken man he can't bare the fear of society
He won't stand can't take the falseness around him
And fearing for survival scared he's looking at me
And cries out for help
Runs out from class and he's down again
Throwing up from the sight it's the strain and it spreads
It's a curse make it stop please I beg
My arms feel heavy
Yeah they burn as I beat that wall
The thought of escape gives me strength to carry on
So I'll go
I leave my heart to you
Please know that I hate myself for what I had to do
I faded inside out but baby
I won't let the river take me down
Never said goodbye but maybe it's too late for that now love
I run from suicide
Hands bloody but it made me feel alive

So I ran tried my best to succeed I will win
I can feel it and at times I was free relieved of the hate
The thought gives me purpose
Makes me not wanna lose
And without it I'm lost that furthers me from you
Now I see myself now I see through the lies
Evade the empty words do things by heart
And I can hear the sound as I leave this town
Locked in that cage for years and I fought my way out
And I glide down on a sunset sky
Free of the stereotype I feel alive
Every day when I'm gone I think of you all
Those who I left behind so that I could go on

I faded inside out but baby
I won't let the river take me down
Never said goodbye but maybe it's too late for that now love
I run from suicide
Hands bloody but it made me feel alive
One day I'll return
I'll go back home where my heart belongs
And with the shadows gone
Hope glows on
Now let the fire rise
And turn the fear to smoke
Let it make me strong
And so I march
March against the sea of pain
And when you'll see me come I'll be a victorious man
And I am sorry if ever I have left you behind
But we will meet again in a better world better life

I faded inside out but baby
I won't let the river take me down
Never said goodbye but maybe it's too late for that now love
I run from suicide
Hands bloody but you made me feel alive"

If it ever comes, if it ever comes
It don’t really matter anyway
If it ever comes
I ain’t coming for now cheap pay

[Verse 1]

Party In the valley
Till we party in the hills
We don’t need no valet
Cause we parked by the field
Party in the parking lot, we are about to spark for real
Loving the process, because the struggle got feels

I be staying on aggression, cause I already done chilled
And I’m a keep raging, until I get my fill, what’s the deal
It’s a party on the west side
But the east keep feeding me STEEL
I ain’t really G’d up
But if it fits the bill
[Chorus]

How u feel Hapa?
Hella proper, Highter than a helicopter
Big time on a teleprompter
Easy sell with no telemarketer
Oh that’s good Hapa?
Yeah right, I’ma get it locked air tight
Till you stare right
Till I make this shit a fair fight
Oh yeah you a tough guy?
Fuck yeah, when I’m tripping off this fungi

[Verse 2]

All year, yeah I been getting dumb fly
Slipping w my shoes tied
Till I’m poolside
Who am I
And if it ever comes
If it ever comes
I be ready for the kick and the drum
Ready for the hit, cause it’s lit in the front
Like everybody jump
Got you all stumped
Grabbing my tree trunk
Bout to get a hunk of the funk
For weekend
We gon get our beast on
For the tetons
Don’t tell me NADA
Cause I know that we on
Let yo freak flag fly
Cause the heat won’t rise
Unless the streets gon ride
With the Hapa when I’m on top of this in due time
How we looking now?
Blou! Too fine, supine
Two timed the rhyme
Just a few times
Till I loosen every loose mine
[Chorus]

How u feel Hapa?
Hella proper, Highter than a helicopter
Big time on a teleprompter
Easy sell with no telemarketer
Oh that’s good Hapa?
Yeah right, I’ma get it locked air tight
Till you stare right
Till I make this shit a fair fight
Oh yeah you a tough guy?
Fuck yeah, when I’m tripping off this fungi

[Verse 3]

So what’s really good?
Nada man, just some contraband
For the summer man, on the come up till the sun up man, lookin like the prodigal son of man, about to get a buncha ham for going ham in the stands, breaking down the master plan for the jam, yes I can
Make u understand that I’m damn serious
On the styrups when I steer us
To the promise land
Hella fly, I might never land
Outta sight outta mind
Ain’t part of my grind
So pardon my shine
This loud too loud
To be inside
And u too fine not to slide with guys
So let’s ride into the summertime
Cause we emboldened, italicized underlined
All at the same time
Got ur stereo, blaring yo
You should play mine tho
Here we go, here we go
[Chorus]

How u feel Hapa?
Hella proper, Highter than a helicopter
Big time on a teleprompter
Easy sell with no telemarketer
Oh that’s good Hapa?
Yeah right, I’ma get it locked air tight
Till you stare right
Till I make this shit a fair fight
Oh yeah you a tough guy?
Fuck yeah, when I’m tripping off this fungi

[Verse 1: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
You say it's simple, it's who you ought to be
Look in the mirror, you are not what you see
You say it's simple, but aren't your wings tired?
To tell the truth, why do you have to hide?

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
Look, me and the mic, we coexist
My flow is a glass box with no exits
And you can observe while you trapped in it
Took my lady's track and I sprinkled some rap in it
They telling me lies

[Bridge: Melissa McIntyre as Ashley Kerwin]
What's wrong with being someone else?
No shame, and living life their way, tell me lies

[Interlude: Drake as Jimmy Brooks]
They like, ""Please, please tell us your reality, J!
We can't fathom how it feel to be forever confined.""
My mother always told me what to do with my best foot
So to this day, you know that it is never behind
And, metaphorically, I'm ahead of the rest
And proud of the fact that I've accomplished that
And every time I say that I can do it myself
In the same breath, I wonder where my accomplice at
It's like

Tell me anything but the truth
Cause I don't really know if I can take it now

Cause the fabrication would help to settle that
And imagination would ease the pain

But can't guarantee to you that I'mma leave the same, so

You planted a seed
Way down deep in the ground
Patiently, Waiting for the sun to shine down
You believed
Even though you couldn't see
Where it was going
That all the pain and suffering
Was worth the seed
That you were sewing

Chorus:
And a sweet hallelujah
Fell from your lips
Whatever the cost, Lord
Whatever the risk
Your words like a fragrance
Filled up the air
Heaven is raining down blessings
Because of your prayers (Because of your prayers)

Like stars in the sky
And grains of sand by the sea
How far and how wide
Generations In distance they reach
You believed that one day
There would be a mighty harvest
Now from Heaven you will see
That we will finish what you started

8167,"Love me no more, now let the god depart,
If love be grown so bitter to your tongue!
Here is my hand; I bid you from my heart
Fare well, fare very well, be always young.
As for myself, mine was a deeper drouth:
I drank and thirsted still; but I surmise
My kisses now are sand against your mouth,
Teeth in your palm and pennies on your eyes.
Speak but one cruel word, to shame my tears;
Go, but in going, stiffen up my back
To meet the yelping of the mustering years —
Dim, trotting shapes that seldom will attack
Two with a light who match their steps and sing:
To one alone and lost, another thing."
7830,"In a two room trailer down by the tracks on the edge of a Tennessee town
Jesse Clay lived with his lady and a one eyed Redbone hound
And every night at 12:05 he'd hear that whistle whine
And Jesse knew the train from Chattanooga was comin' by on time

And we all knew old Jesse Clay got mean when he drank too much
And Jesse's lady wore the scars of his not too gentle touch
And Jesse knocked her down one night just for bustin' a bottle of gin
She hit her head when she hit the floor and she never got up again

Now Jesse Clay was crazy scared when he saw her lyin' still
He took his lady in his arms and he carried her up the hill
He's laid her down on a railroad track just an hour ahead of the train
And Jesse knew that soon the 12:05 would take the blame

And then he went to town and he waited around till he thought the time was right
And he told the law how the 12:05 had taken his lady's life
The sheriff just looked at Jesse hard, said you better tell the truth this time
Because the 12:05 just jumped the track about 10 miles up the line

And no one knows what caused the train to leave the tracks that night
It never happened before or since but it served old Jesse right
You can still hear the train whistle whine as it passes by this way
But the 12:05 won't ever take the blame for Jesse Clay
No, the 12:05 won't ever take the blame for Jesse Clay"

Out of the shadows
One by one they came
To shed their light upon his moment of doubt and pain

A thousand voices
Rang out through the night
A symphony of mercy for their savior
Too tired to fight

And as the chorus grew
A thousand hearts beat true
Then like a glowing beacon in the dark
Hope came shining through

Amazingly the savior found his voice
And all together they rejoiced...

Guide her tonight
Out of the darkness

Unbind the chains of endless sleep

Make me a vessel of thy boundless grace

She lives today!"

Meant for killing slowly

Germination begins as corrupt seeds
Spread their sickness through the landscape;

I done it all man the plastic had me draped in the BAPE
Young and buckwild, you could think I had a cape
Is that your girl? Back then man we probably had a tape
Not saying to demean, showing you exactly why I ain’t fucking with the scene
Focused on living out my dreams in my reality
If normal is sane, then I’m living in insanity, splashed with a little bit of vanity
How I stay grounded when loud keeps messing ‘bout with gravity
Write my own script got a lotta folks mad I ain’t living out a tragedy
Running round raggedy
But I work like KK, stood for Kunta Kinte, but live like Cinque, free
Them scraps, them tatts; that’s me
Them suits, them books; that’s me
Them beats, them streets; that’s me
Live young, live free if you think I’ll take an L you don’t know me

Did it on my own, no reliance

Won’t you please

For me

Honеy-gold fireflies

Won't you rewind the day

8436,"Will you save me a seat
At the world's last heartbeat?
Watch her lungs melt
As we lose another shelf
A shell of her former self
Stripped of all her wealth

Will you please take my hand?
As we make our final stand
As the tide pulls away
And the sun starts our last day

I'm glad I could spend it at all
No winters, no spring, and no fall
A desert as far as the
I can see you standing there

Waiting for the worst
To wash up on the shore
An endless phantom
Summer takes its toll"

I can't hold it any longer
My huge hands, your sweet short hair
Erasing all of my despair

How could I be someone you want?

I hope you're okay
And I'm sure that you'll be fine

I know my ground and won't step the line
I know you'll be happy
And I'll be gone eventually

I won't be naive, I love you
But I know my place, I won't bother you

One sip of coffee, took a look outside, and then I said hey

Do you see the clouds rolling by?

Do you see the trees on the hill?
If you open your eyes
Then I know that you will

I play my music, every afternoon, now don't tell my wife
Love what you do, and you will never work a day in your life

Do you hear the song that I sing?
(yes, it's true)
Do you hear the music I bring ?
(it's for you)
Do you want your love to be real?
If you open your heart
Then I know you can feel

Dig the beat, and dig your heels into the ground
Dig a hole, to see what's waiting underground
Ain't much to see, by only looking down
Better change your direction, na-na-na-now

The time I'm waiting for, is when I see the stars, I will say
The sun is running down, but city lights, will still let me play
Stay up all night, until I start again, the very next day

Do you see the sun in the sky?

Why did run away

6916,"My first thought was, he lied in every word,
         That hoary cripple, with malicious eye
        Askance to watch the working of his lie
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford
Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored
         Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.

What else should he be set for, with his staff?
         What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare
         All travellers who might find him posted there,
And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh
Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph
         For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,

If at his counsel I should turn aside
        Into that ominous tract which, all agree,
        Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly
I did turn as he pointed: neither pride
Nor hope rekindling at the end descried.
        So much as gladness that some end might be.
For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,
         What, with my search drawn out thro' years, my hope
         Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope
With that obstreperous joy success would bring,—
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring
         My heart made, finding failure in its scope.

As when a sick man very near to death
        Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end
        The tears, and takes the farewell of each friend,
And hears one bid the other go, draw breath
Freelier outside, (""since all is o'er,"" he saith,
        ""And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;"")

While some discuss if near the other graves
         Be room enough for this, and when a day
        Suits best for carrying the corpse away,
With care about the banners, scarves, and staves:
And still the man hears all, and only craves
         He may not shame such tender love and stay.

Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,
        Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ
        So many times among ""The Band""—to wit,
The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed
Their steps—that just to fail as they, seemed best,
        And all the doubt was now—should I be fit?
So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,
        That hateful cripple, out of his highway
        Into the path he pointed. All the day
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim
        Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.

For mark! no sooner was I fairly found
        Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,
        Than, pausing to throw backward a last view
O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; gray plain all round:
Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound,
        I might go on; naught else remained to do.

So, on I went. I think I never saw
        Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:
        For flowers—as well expect a cedar grove!
But cockle, spurge, according to their law
Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,
        You'd think; a burr had been a treasure trove.

No! penury, inertness, and grimace,
        In some strange sort, were the land's portion. ""See
        Or shut your eyes,"" said Nature peevishly,
""It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:
'Tis the Last Judgment's fire must cure this place,
Calcine its clods and set my prisonersº free.""
If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk
        Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bentsº
        Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents
In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as° to balk
All hope of greenness? 'tis a brute must walk
        Pashing their life out, with a brute's intents.

As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair
        In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud
        Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,
Stood stupefied, however he came there:
Thrust out past service from the devil's stud!

Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,
        With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain,
         And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;
I never saw a brute I hated so;
        He must be wicked to deserve such pain.

I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart.
         As a man calls for wine before he fights,
        I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.
Think first, fight afterwards—the soldier's art:
One taste of the old time sets all to rights.

Not it°! I fancied Cuthbert's reddening face
        Beneath its garniture of curly gold,
        Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold
An arm in mine to fix me to the place,
That way he used. Alas, one night's disgrace!
        Out went my heart's new fire and left it cold.

Giles then, the soul of honour—there he stands
        Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.
        What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.
Good—but the scene shifts—faugh! what hangman hands
Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands
        Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!

Better this present than a past like that;
        Back therefore to my darkening path again!
        No sound, no sight so far as eye could strain.
Will the night send a howletº or a bat?
I asked: when something on the dismal flat
        Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.

A sudden little river crossed my path
        As unexpected as a serpent comes.
        No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;
This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath
For the fiend's glowing hoof—to see the wrath
        Of its black eddy bespateº with flakes and spumes.

So petty, yet so spiteful! All along,
        Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;
        Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit
Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:
The river which had done them all the wrong,
        Whate'er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.

Which, while I forded,—good saints, how I feared
        To set my foot upon a dead man's cheek,
        Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek
For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!
—It may have been a water-rat I speared,
        But, ugh! it sounded like a baby's shriek.

Glad was I when I reached the other bank.
        Now for a better country. Vain presage!
        Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage
Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank
Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank,
        Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage—

The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.
        What penned them there, with all the plain, to choose?
        No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,
None out of it. Mad brewage set to work
Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turkº
        Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.

And more than that—a furlong on—why, there!
        What bad use was that engineº for, that wheel,
        Or brake, not wheel—that harrow fit to reel
Men's bodies out like silk? with all the air
Of Tophet'sº tool, on earth left unaware,
        Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.

Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,
        Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth
        Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,
Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood
Changes, and off he goes!) within a rood—
        Bog, clay, and rubble, sand, and stark black dearth.

Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,
         Now patches where some leanness of the soil's
        Broke into moss or substances like boils;
Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim
        Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.

And just as far as ever from the end,
        Naught in the distance but the evening, naught
        To point my footstep further! At the thought,
A great black bird, Apollyon'sº bosom-friend,
Sailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned
        That brushed my cap—perchance the guide I sought.

For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,
        'Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place
        All round to mountains—with such name to grace
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.
How thus they had surprised me,—solve it, you!
        How to get from them was no clearer case.

Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick
        Of mischief happened to me, Gods knows when—
        In a bad dream, perhaps. Here ended, then,
Progress this way. When, in the very nick
Of giving up, one time more, came a click
        As when a trap shuts—you're inside the den.

Burningly it came on me all at once,
         This was the place! those two hills on the right,
        Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;
While, to the left, a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce,
Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,
        After a life spent training for the sight!

What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?
         The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,
         Built of brown stone, without a counterpart
In the whole world. The tempest's mocking elf
Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf
         He strikes on, only when the timbers start.

Not see? because of night perhaps?—why, day
        Came back again for that! before it left,
        The dying sunset kindled thro' a cleft:
The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,
        ""Now stab and end the creature—to the heft!""

Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled
        Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears,
        Of all the lost adventurers my peers,—
How such a one was strong, and such was bold,
And such was fortunate, yet each of old
        Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.

There they stood, ranged along the hillsides, met
        To view the last of me, a living frame
        For one more picture! in a sheet of flame
I saw them and I knew them all. And yet
Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,
        And blew. ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came."""
8953,"[Verse 1]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all
[Verse 2:]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Bridge]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say
[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish, we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

[Outro]
'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all

[Jason & Lenay talking]
I feel like Chad Chad Kroeger
Chad Kroeger? Why Chad Kroeger?
I don't know I just feel like him
I'm really not fine at all
You do like Chad Kroeger"

Another fucking fruit and vegetable stand

East River Park

God damn
Ice cream parlors and newspaper stands on fire
Things falling over
Discombobulation (discombobulation)"
7132,"[Verse 1]
I'm waiting to be someone else
When I could look back through the vacancy
Is it the grave where my soul is trapped
And in my end to the demons before me

[Chorus]
In the glow of devils light I can see the face of God
He touched a man and stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast in devils light
My soul is in pain

[Verse 2]
Just once I want to see a tear
A small sign to show me you care
Stomach-ache, Head-ache
I'd rather die alone

In the glow of devils light I can see the face of God
He touched a man and stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast in devils light
My soul is in pain

The limit of my mind
Has reached its end
I become the monster
You say I am

In the glow of devils light I have seen the face of God
He touched a man and stands before the flame
It burns bright, cast in devils light

Look out the window to pass the time
Raise your eyes to planes so high, and

We get the feeling we’re not doing enough
It's just rush, rush, rush, fill your day with stuff, and
I don’t know why I can’t stay here tonight

And pick up the remote control
I just can’t let it go
Pick up the remote control
I just can’t let it go

Thoughts in my head, I try to put them to bed
Give it a rest, the ultimate test, yeah
Back in our youth, we would do things for fun
Take a day off with no implications, and
I don’t know why I can’t stay here tonight

Flicking the remote control
I just can’t let it go
Flicking the remote control
I just can’t let you go

Into a knot, it won’t start
Unravelling if you don’t

3748,"Well you came all this fucking way to lose it all
You know your head won't come to rest beneath these squalls
Still here we are running down a dream
Living in a past that never will come clean
What the fuck are we doing here?
You shouldn't need a song to make this clear

Lost sight of all you ever dreamed of
There has to be a reason while you still insist on tearing yourself down
Became the one thing you're afraid of
Your mind already made up, if you let no one in you'll never make it out

Even now you still refuse to just forget her
And when your heart expires you'll blame it on the weather
Chasing down the past like some white whale
You know that's a ship that never will set sail
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Get off your fucking ass get out the door

Out of time and out of place
The years like scars across your face
Old records to remind you life is long when you're longing"
2534,"[Verse 1]
I'm comin' from the struggle so you know this my rebuttal
You ain't listen to me then, that's why I'm throwin' out the subtle
And I'm [?] the heat so you can put it on repeat
You valley rappers are my brothers, but I'm seasonin' the beef, damn
Ya'll just mad my shit's on TV, homies that believe me
Cookin' combinations like a three-piece
I'm tryna put my shit on CD's, Thunderbird the EP
That's not enough, why you tease me?
I'm not your rival, I'm your idol
You study my verses and highlight it like a bible
You're not even worth it because your bitch is so entitled
I'd tell you in person that your shit needs a revival, but you in denial
I slit my wrists to make ink from my calligraphy pen
My metaphors are too bizarre for these ignorant men
The synonyms of my life are my brother and kin
I reminisce on the times that I never fit in

[Verse 2]
I wrote my way out the hood, but not like anybody else
I was stackin' them books, so I could stack up on my wealth
I got a way with my looks, ask my wifie how she felt
I got a Glock for the crooks, 'cause I care about her health
I'm a nice to please, don't end up on my death list
I'll book you with the rice, on con [?] on a checklist
Reigns buy an [?], so chief was the best fit
If I die tonight my sons start up where I left it
Wait, wait I'm almost finished
Let me take you way, way back to the beginning
There go Lil O rollin' up fakes, dippin'
My demeanor's way too strong so the ego's trippin'
As a youngin' I've been hustlin' every day, though
My pockets never hungry 'cause I always carry change, though
Half of fam's doin' drugs, this ain't a game, though
But we always movin' forward like a [?]
[Verse 3]
Yeah, look
I carry from the gutter but I""m born from a boombox
My flows are six-four cause I make the whole crew hop
Last Sunday, my dream, I was this close to Tupac
Out this autotune and you make you soundin' like the Doo Wops
We don't really fuck around, bitch, we dangerous
We around thugged out, so they labeled us, ""Be ready to throw down in case you hang with us""
What the fuck they want now, like my name is Russ
Came up from the dub, see, I don't need to carry heat
I carried my community, now they wanna carry me
They granted me immunity, no one sicker than me
So save up all your eulogies, 'cause no one gonna end me
I'm taking the time to write this rhyme, I'm finally off that Aderol
Livin' divine, I'm out my mind, I found my spirit animal
Like Hannibal, Hannibal Lecter, give you a lecture like I'm the professor
I'll cut your throat like a goddamn Pez dispenser"

I been drinking all day long rolling out with a box of songs
Welcome to the terror dome bitch
Always knew I was destined to go on
For so long everything feelin so wrong they been telling me to go strong
And flow on and so on and so on
And so on
In a city so magic where we all got vicious habits
This life will turn a baptist into an average addict
It's So tragic but I love me some 3 0 fifth
Where you go for the weekend come back home and they telling you to plead the fifth
Lambos rent out for like 7 days
Go hard like Rambo then come back and exchange for the Chevrolet
You want sunshine we gotta bit of that and ass to match
First time I was on the beach I nearly fell to my knees had an asthma attack
Here in the city we pride in the best of nightlife
You got curfews we got work through to the morning we seeing the bright lights
And that's an everyday thang
Round here it's reg-u-lar
To leave out with an exit scar
Face down in the best of bars
Somebody pick up my tab I'll get ya the next time
You know I'm good for it you know what it is Wreks mind
I gotta have it I'm foaming out of the mouth I'm rabid
I could let the whole world just vanish in a city so magic

And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Black Magic City
And it seems like magic
Do you believe in sex drugs rock and roll all in my black magic city

[Verse 2: Ras Kass]
It's LAX lavish latins and blacks ratchet
Pale bitches tanning on beaches
And that's that Kate Blanchet
Police copters chase dope dealers and that's traffic
Pornographic stars strut in starbucks
It's that classic
Bright lights luxe cars
These chicks don't date regular dudes
They only fuck stars
Top model pop bottle
Casting couches i love her
Prettiest girls in America
Come her to get discovered
Some get discouraged quit bar tending
And start stripping
Beverly hills mansion party that's where they start sniffing
My city quake halos and volcanos
St. monica st. pedro
We lost angels
Coked up rich kids corporate big wigs
Movie producers and actors
She from a small town with them tractors
So now she ain't trying to go backwards
We on red carpets with the athletes
And them pop stars and them rappers
We like vip in them backseats papparazzi follow with cameras
She got a nose job and them new lips and them huge tits do attract ya
Had no ass took kadashian
Got back like abracadabra
See the celtics believed that the holly tree had magical properties
Bad or good
So witches made magic wands out of holly
And that's why our city named Hollywood

3127,"You're a synchronized dub of that jiggy shit in clubs
You even got a sub-stitute you pay to hit the pubs
Both a you sport Maytag watches that you bought on Jamaica Ave
Drivin' up and down in your broken jag
Ya hustle, I gotta knock it, cause you ain't makin a prophet
Ya dreams of being famous should've stayed in the closet
Ya life is like a mock trial (order order)
Like havin a phone with no-one to dial you claim that (?) is your pile
I'm organizin a million thoughts runnin wild in my heart
When it beats it creates musical art
That talks and melodies only heard by Mozart
Telepathically traveled a form of hip-hop classical
That makes your mind goin sabbatical to study my rappin'
And she'll say its magical then hear your shit and start laughin'
Walk to your room grab your clothes and start packin'
Then send you to the hip-hop temple, In Manhattan

If you got beef then we can shoot joints
You gotta cop 12 if you wanna hear joints

Roll a bag and loose I'm a clip you like joints
We score points cause we got joints, Check it out

Three of the best that's unsigned, at one time
Getting bids like the 1-9 at rush-time, Naturally I bust mine
Don't touch mine with one rhyme we drop the hammer
And your crew gets to steppin like a ? actor
I voice the musical truth make it arrogant like ego trip
You wasn't havin it, now you on the penal tip
I seem to flip razors for sure with adverbs and add herbs till my shit list to get served
With bad words hanging out west with Mad Merse
You can't verse, steppin to mine y'all get hearsed
And done first after you've hung my first verse your worst thirst
Is waitin for Minds to rewind so call your night nurse
Why just lifted the skirt, it's 99 so we puttin in work

Chorus

The world was beggin for a savior so I finally came
To bring these jokers up to speed on how we playin this game
You know my name, Worldwide I get around like a spliff
So every word got em stickin to their guns like the sheriff
I'm not here to change destiny but to fulfill it
And stay fly like the bullets from a gat when you pull it
Red beans, Sweat teams, never missin that mark
So cats wanna hear my big dogs bark and spit sparks
I treaded soft when I started off, now niggas is getting carted off
Cause they wasn't show now they know
That a Master can play a fool, but a fool masters nothin
So they salty like stove top stuffin
I fake in, natural like skin
Until you front that's when I have to loosen your chin
Get all up inside your chest like a gin well you sound too thin
You can't win you better lip synch or start goals(?) right then

If happiness truly comes from feeling alive
Then why does every day feel just like I have died
In this place, I'm digging my own grave
My heart stops as I start to break away
I break away from all these thoughts so filled with pain

All these thoughts so filled with pain

At this point
I'm all out of bitter tears to shed
This is what I feared
What is real when I'm numb to my pain?

Someone please help me out alive
Life is a lie, death is our debt
My end is near

As I fall, all around you

A circle burnt into the sand
Is someone without you
Who placed a ring upon your hand
To try and disguise you -----

As I fall, all around you
Voices call, but what: can I do?

The things i meant to say
All seem to slip away -----

The forward motion of this fall
Is only because you -----
Smile as you slip yourself on me
The danger becomes you -----
As I fall, all around you

No matter how hard I wish
There are illusions that won't become true
Even so, I closed eyes
And kept walking ahead

[Post-Chorus]
No matter
How many nights have repeated
I'm seeking for an indelible light
Even though I know, I couldn't back
To the way I've been through

[Chorus]
The world would start to revolve
The moment we prayed for a miracle
I don't need any other things
Right here, there are
""Hopes for future""
""Hopes of prayer""
That I want to send to you
Even if I ended up hurt
Or hurting someone
And lost all of my everything
Never become true
But I want to make it true
I'm still grasping tight this desire
[Verse 2]
No matter how hard I scream
There are realities that can't be changed
I turned my back
But still couldn't let them go

[Post-Chorus]
No matter how many times
I sigh to the stars
But they're too far
None of my prayers would reach them
Even though the answer I chose
Is never be forgiven

[Chorus]
The world would start to change
The moment we erased the hesitation away
I don't need any other things
Just a single ""Hope for freedom""
""Hope for dreams"" that I want to grasp
Never become true
But I want to make it true
Holding this promise close to my heart

[Instrumental]
[Bridge]
Rather than curse the fate, it'd be better
If you seek for the power to fight
You can't throw down the gauntlet
With such a half-assed resolution
Extol the song of the beginning
To the depth of despair
Our journey is just started
Eat all the obstacles away

[Post-Chorus]
If you want something done right
You have to do it yourself
Life is what you make it
Oh I can beat fate

[Chorus]
The world would start to revolve
The moment we prayed for a miracle
I don't need any other things
Right here, there are
""Hopes for future.""
""Hopes of prayer.""
That I want to send to you
Even if I ended up hurt
Or hurting someone
And lost all of my everything
Never become true
But I want to make it true

Your vibrant hose lookin for a hydrant
I'm the strident voice dissing tyrants

I'm more hip hop than most of today's rappers
They ain't rappers I think we should call them trappers
Their mumble gave me da  balls to start rap in English
Cause I' m better even with my second language

That I learned from the rap of the nineties
This rap was the best this rap is the mighty
Now they mumble and bumble as they can't speak rightly
They reduced my nose to rubble cause theirrap is farty

Same sound same beats same autotune

Death in every corner every corner is a bluff
That made me strong that made me really tough
I'm hard and they just marshmallow fluffs

They run from police but I run to police

Those days are gone and now I live at peace
So keep it peace and don't piss me off, please

My songs are girls without makeup I'm da truth
You will hardly find em between this fake boobs
They still better no matter who you gonna chose
And they waiting for you, not for the foolish goose
Bury me you won't kill me I'm the seed
For fresh lil minds who gonna take the lead
Fuck the flock in my gut I believe

So sad, doesn't matter
Nobody cares that your heart's shattered

Understand no reasoning of the mind
You understand conquest, you’ve made it your art
So my friend I’m here to conquer your kind

Holophernes I will not care
For your hollow concern
I only want you for your head

You will say that my courage is tainted by
The attitude, that if God’s a patriarch
Then beheading you is killing him too
So my friend listen to all the hounds bark

Holophernes I will not care
For your hollow concern
I only want you for your head

Please no flowers as they die
Bad jokes and I eat you raw

There is nothing here exceptional

There is nothing here to die for

There is nothing here to be proud of

There is nothing to celebrate

American exceptionalism

What a blatant fucking lie

Squeezed dry to build up billionaires

Profit always over human lives

Homicidal police roam with free reign

Overreach, abuse, and murder as they please
Do you love your country?

Wants to kill and die for this fraudulеnt republic

What a model Citizen

Seven brides, the devil's wives
Seven priests and seven sins
Seven gates to enter in

The devil comes and offers all

680,"(Yea) I think it’s time to give a glimpse of this Apocalypse wrath
That resides on the other side of this Anonymous mask
Opposing us is a preposterous task. Don’t even bother to ask
You’ve got to be drinking out of a bottomless flask
Ain’t no blocking this path
In order to restore this once peaceful land
My fellowship will make you disappear like Smeagol’s band
And clear your whole battalion with a single hand
Cerebral scan will show you that
My thinking gland’s overloaded with evil plans
I’m standing in the epicenter where this war was born
What you’re used to seeing, that was just the calm before the storm
The breath of a dragon is where my sword was forged
Finna devour souls, and this whole planet’s a smorgasbord
Better get on the horn and warn your family and best of friends
They don’t want to get added to this field full of severed limbs
So many enemies, it feels like we’ll never win
They keep coming wave after wave. Will it ever end?

Stone cold glare reminiscent of Obsidian
Searching for a care while I stare into Oblivion
So many enemies it feels like we’ll never win
They keep coming wave after wave. Will it ever end?
(Yo) I see the writing on the wall. Problematic rapper
Wrote disaster in his bars, while you fabricated yours
Nothing less than tragic. Imagine a lost cause
Attacking on any track I'm backing to kill them all
And force wars upon every last wack rapper rapping
I'm accurate in the storm
For too long mother fuckers been fair warned
That I’m a real killer. You’re gripped in the dogs jaws
And I’ve been itching to drop bombs
Safety's all gone. I'm Battletron. The city's ours
I leave these rappers in the spirit form (Why?)
So you can speak to them on Ouija boards. They’re never more
And that's some shit you’ve never seen before
I wrote my destiny and grabbed the torch (Look)
I spark the fire and retire your defiant swarms
It’s Metropolitix. The mic is on

Stone cold glare reminiscent of Obsidian
Searching for a care while I stare into Oblivion
So many enemies it feels like we’ll never win
They keep coming wave after wave. Will it ever end?

There's only four of us, ‘bout a million of them
I got my weapon of choice. Clock countless kills with a pen
I'm a sniper in the cypher. I'm precise at a distance
And verbal assault rifles leave them wiped from existence
Lifeless and limbless. The thrill of revenge
Resurrect them for a second just to kill them again
And sensitive apprentices are looking defenseless
A lesson to professionals, my team is relentless
Take any mc on the scene off his hinges
With endless preemptives centered at your premises
My sentences are limitless, my penmanship is venomous
Percentages are generous, we're winning this unanimous
With advanced weaponry. Certain death to everything
I shorten your expectancy with every single breath I breathe
You couldn't mess with me. My lyrical trajectory is definite
Perfectionist, I never miss poetically
Stone cold glare reminiscent of Obsidian
Searching for a care while I stare into Oblivion
So many enemies it feels like we’ll never win
They keep coming wave after wave. Will it ever end?

It's like I'm constantly battlin' this gang of drones
For fortune and fame alone, been searching this game of thrones
Through shattered bones in catacombs. That's what it's known for
This whole war is built off fables and folklore
And oh Lord, give me the strength to keep fightin'
Keep the light through the night when the lightings strikin' the Titan
You've been waiting for this fire when it finally ignites
I keep enough heat up inside of it to bury you twice
These rappers ain't very nice. You’re looking scared with a mic
While you’re standin' there. You’re gamblin'. You’re rolling the dice
You'll pay the price when the battle begins
The feelings right. Kill the light. See the shadows within
Stone cold glare reminiscent of obsidian
Searching for a care while I stare to Oblivion
Heaven-sent veteran, better than all the rest of them
They keep coming wave after wave this will never end

Stone cold glare reminiscent of Obsidian
Searching for a care while I stare into Oblivion
So many enemies it feels like we’ll never win
They keep coming wave after wave. Will it ever end?"

The mic go off, dont even try to fight the force
Im tryin to lock it down globally like microsoft
Blaze tracks, but ive never been the type to floss
Wipe the floors with fake ass rappers, they ain't moving the crowd
I showed you before, plus im proving it now (and smoothing it out)
I still bring the ruckus to this and while you home on the couch (i stay up in the mix)
You got a bad attitude, thats something to fix
Im gettin love from ya crew, coz they be pumpin my dick
Think nothing of this, i could do it my sleep YA FEEL
So while you non-talent muhfuckers keep shit real

Thats not my most of operandi, understand, I
Redefine the role of the villian, respect the bad guy
Award winning sentences, acclaimed critical lyrical
Most of ya'll just spit generical references
Its very circuitous, 360 degrees in fact
Breeze through ya down and leave with my steeds in tact
With ease i rap, you chopping mad takes for a verse
Bullshit punches, my hunches, you should wait and rehearse
Stop i heard the hot shit and your not it
You need to cop this, steady drop this, heavy rock shit
Its over, HUH, ya'll ain't heard, im the deacon of words
Freaking the verb, while you speaking absurd
Take some decent reserve, with foot soldiers with balls big as boulders
To move obstacles so save your acting for the movie

Yo rapping is dead, i dont spit, i flow
Flip the script, nahh, stick to the shit you know
The clique you owe, and dick you blow belong to me
Got ya shit on to me, my word is Bond like Sean Connery
Ladies still feel me when im 75
Point oh 9 with no license, still ready to drive
I study the vibe, its like that R&B classic, track shit
Rappers act spastic, when i flash hits
So merge ya words with virgin herbs
Ain't my function, dont wanna keep the peace, i'd rather punch em
Straight hard hits of the target, im never sprayin
Came in here with my fist in ya mouth, so what u saying

Filling my apartment with gloom, and a cough every few bars delivering caution amuse
When things fall apart you gon' part with the few shards of your hard left with the rest in the tomb

With a venomous kiss, a quick flick of the blade across the vein with a liquor dispense the champagne a continuous drip of abstain with a name like (Reversed name) not many resist I was told

It's the 5th of August and I find myself wishing I could split with all this
Got me feeling like maybe we can switch regardless

But only one will catch your dreams
Twisted minds, immortal sick places
All of this flows with your tears!"
6291,"He is waiting and he is hiding
Always plotting in the shadows
Planning and rearranging
Our thoughts for his tomorrow

Moves like a ghost and rules you
Knows everything we know
Never sleeps and never pauses
He's the king of liars

Working behind the curtains
He's the father of evil men
Raises children with a whip
When they grow he feeds on them

The greatest lie he told
Is that this is how things should be
That living in cages
Is better than running free

Master of confusion
Set me free
Master of illusions
I summon thee
Master of confusion
Set us free
Master of illusions
We summon thee...
Master of confusion, he's the father of evil men
Raising children with the whip and when they grow he feeds on them
The greatest lie that he told: is that this is how things should be
That living in cages is better than running free"

But you gave me more than I wanted
Wasn't really trying to even be the one
But I staged it like it was coming

Cross me once nigga, no more passage
I'mma still be here when all said and done
And like I told you before
I ain't tryna be the one, you see
When the truth staring you right in your face
Tell me what you gonna do
Some people get addicted after the first taste
Cause misery loves a fool

The stress and the anger I can't manage
Somewhere between these other 8 planets I stay stranded
With all my wounds stitched up, wrapped in this ace bandage
I make them pass out on the line, like Hank Gathers
Cause cake matters, soda mixed in this cake batter
Now papa got a brand new bag with the same swagger
I Mick Jagger when I rock out with the same dagger
She said it like a Green Bay Packer, the aim splattered
I ball out for 40 highlights on the game tracker
Same chapter with this wannabe posers and lame rappers
Now I'm the one they came after, this is my battle with the Devil's child
Trying to make sure that we never smile
We never smile when coke fiends got they own dreams
Gotta get the garbage from 'round me, I'm tryna go green
Niggas in late feelings, the antidote is morphine
Real niggas only, I hope you make it to quarantine
[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]

With Luciferic fire that burns between your horns
Fill it with your magic, your spirit
Make it the sterile area of your holiness

The tree growing on it's square is like death
Up grown by your black light
The fruits ever dying on it's branches
From where the man can eat their wisdom

And their bread of the ones doomed to perdition
And the wine of those doomed to Hell
Everything it breeds in front of us
We shall enjoy without fear...

I step into Your dark tunnels
Where only instics guide me!
As for us getting lost is a victory
Univetiable part of the path of your gnosis
The prize is standing at the end
In the uttermost end of the labyrinth...

Horned master of the dark witches
Forge the weapons of our own liberation
The Luciferian Will!

The remains of a light dinner are nearby. Wine is chilling.

ON TV: SHARON: -I’m Sharon Schieber.

Amy’s eyes are glued to the TV. We see a montage of The Nick and Amy story: Amazing Amy, their wedding photo, Andie.

We can hear key words: “The girl everyone wanted to be,” “the marriage everyone admired,” “shocking debts,” “a surprise
pregnancy,” “and a very young, very pretty secret.”

Desi is glaring at Amy’s un-dyed hair, her comfy cotton sundress. Amy doesn’t notice. She’s rapt.

ON TV: SHARON (CONT’D): Now, exclusively, a husband breaks his silence not just on his wife’s disappearance but on his
infidelity—and all those shocking rumors.

Cut to interview: NICK and SHARON sitting together.

AMY: I bought that tie.

On TV: SHARON: Nick Dunne, you might be the most hated man in America right now.
NICK: I think you’re probably right, Sharon. And I probably deserve it.

SHARON: Did you kill your wife, Nick?

NICK: I did not kill my wife, Sharon. I am not a murderer.

SHARON: But you were unfaithful.

NICK: I was. I am not proud of my actions.

SHARON: You allowed Amy’s parents, Amy’s friends, the people of your hometown, to believe that you were a loving husband who was desperate to find his missing wife.

NICK: I am desperate to find my missing wife.

SHARON: I just wonder how you can ask us to believe you, now that we kno...you’re a liar?

NICK: I did not come forward about my affair because I knew it would make me look very, very bad. I don’t care anymore about how I look. That’s done. I care about finding my wife.

SHARON: I’m just trying to get clear-

NICK: Let me say this: I am not a killer. But I’m far from being a good guy. I was a bad husband to a wonderful wife. I broke the vow I made to her.

SHARON: What does that mean to you, Nick?

NICK: It means I was basically a con artist.
(MORE)

NICK (CONT’D): I met Amy Elliott seven years ago and I was transfixed. Amy does that. I was an average guy from an average place with mediocre aspirations, and I met this woman who dazzled me. And I wanted her to love me. I pretended to be better
than I was. I made a pledge to her, when we married, to be that man.

INSERT: A perfect wedding portrait of NICK and AMY.

NICK (CONT’D): The man who tries harder. The man who thinks and acts and feels with as much passion as she does. The man who makes her happy. And I failed her. Instead of doing what was right, I did what was easy.

AMY is RAPT: These words RESONATE.

SHARON: You talk like a man who believes he can still make amends to his wife. Who believes his wife is still alive.

NICK: She is alive.

SHARON: OK, then. What would you like to say to your wife tonight?

NICK turns straight to the camera.

NICK: Amy, I love you. You are the best person I have ever known. I have taken myself to the woodshed over the way I treated you. Come home and I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you. I will be the man I promised you I’d be. Please come home.

He puts his finger briefly in the cleft of his chin. His
watch is on camera. Amy smiles. DESI is watching Amy"
6844,"I'm stuck on you like that heart shaped tattoo
That your mum always said that you never thought through
But we all make mistakes when we're twenty two
And you know how she hates everything that we do
You still do it to spite her but honey I can't chose
I'm just stuck on you like that heart shaped tattoo

And you flash through my mind like these old plywood signs
That litter the edge of these freeways I ride
I thought of so many jokes that I'm just dying to tell
And why can't you be lying in that next cheap hotel
To recount all our stories and trade every crime
As it's flashed through my mind
Like these old plywood signs

There's stars in the movies
There's stars in the skies
There's stars on the boulevard
And there's stars in her eyes
But it's the scars that get me
When she lays at my side
And says I know you don't love me
But neither do I
So I'm colored in blue like that heart shaped tattoo
That gets covered in denim when the winter blows through
And I can't kick a demon that looks like she does
No I can't dodge a bullet that feels like her love
Pushed a hundred doors open but I still can't walk through
I'm just stuck on you like that heart shaped tattoo

There's stars in the movies
There's stars in the skies
There's stars on the boulevard
And there's stars in her eyes
But it's the scars that get me
When she lays at my side
And says I know you don't love me
But neither do I

Now every new place just marks how far I travelled from you
And every new face just reminds me what yours can do
But darling after all we've been through
I can't just put this call down and start a new
Girl I'm stuck on you like that heart shaped tattoo
That your mum always said that you never thought through

There's stars in the movies
There's stars in the skies
There's stars on the boulevard
And there's stars in her eyes
But it's so hard to read them no matter what we do
So I just hope some day you'll see they shine inside you
Cause that girl that I once knew could light up the night
And get all of these downtown bars dancing in time
She taught me about beauty, she taught me about pain
She taught me about dancing around drunk in the rain
And I know where she's fallen cause I know how it feels
To go running around this world chasing Keroaks heels
And I retraced those steps to that cheap hotel door
Where I talked you out of trying to fly from the seventeenth floor
Cause theres no angels circling these hollywood dreams
And we're all tired of working the memory machines
Now the boulevards frozen, the skies coming down
But I'm still out here chasing your ghost around this town
With these city lights that love you and I think I might too
That's why I'm stuck on you..
Like that heart shaped tattoo"
5051,"I was about to give up and that's no lie
Cardinal landed outside my window
Threw his head back and sang a song
So beautiful it made me cry

Took me back to a childhood tree
Full of birds and dreams

From this one place I can't see very far
In this one moment I'm square in the dark
These are the things I will trust in my heart
You can see something else
Something else

I don't know what's making me so afraid
Tiny cloud over my head
Heavy and grey with a hint of dread
I don't like to feel this way

Take me back to a window seat
With clouds beneath my feet
From this one place I can't see very far
In this one moment I'm square in the dark
These are the things I will trust in my heart
You can see something else
Something else"

We’ve been programmed to worship
But the wrong gods we flirt with
Run after all that glitters
Deceived by smoke and mirrors
It's a never ending maze
Can't see clear with this haze
Need the Son to burn it off before we get too lost

It's like
Everywhere I'm lookin' man, still not satisfied
Don't know why I'm lookin' fam, with these wandering hungry eyes
It's like I'm eating everyday, but I'm never really full
Always wanting more, so I keep on chasing after

Rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows
They come out after rain
Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows
Always waiting for the rain

Gotta get it, get it
Can't live without it, out it

That's such a prison, living living for thrills and getting getting whats not that, yeah such a mystery, is it not really
Will it give me this?
Can it give me that?
I feel it in my grip, I won't ever give it back
I need it like I'm fiending

Gotta keep on reaching, scratching, scheming, asking, seeking, grasping, needing, pleasing

Rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows

Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows
Always waiting for the rain

Chasing rainbows everyday, they come out after rain
Have you ever met a man that found the gold they give away?
They say, don't you give up now, you almost got it found
Keep chasing and keep wanting; just keep spinning round and round

Money, money, money, that's all they talk about
The richest man can't afford rain in a drought
Money, money, money, that's all they talk about
The richest man can't afford rain in a drought

We’re all born with this thirst, but it's so far from a curse
Drink dirty water you’ll get merked, call the doctor and the nurse
It's not the thirst thats wrong, it's what you turn to that's what harms
Hear the siren hear this alarm, and don't fall for the charm no
Chasing rainbows, rainbows, chasing rainbows
They come out after rain
Chasing rainbows, after rainbows, chasing rainbows

Spins a world that could fall apart
You're doing what only you can
So go and follow your heart

On the horizon, over the hill
Climbing from the wreckage
Sometimes, in love still

Maybe it's just a passing phase
That only time can heal
Don't worry about these troubled days
Tell me how you feel

I wish the rain would go away
For you much more than for me
I know it seems a long long time
Since you were roaming free

Holding all directions, never out of sight
Always one to one
You're the guiding light
Maybe it's just a passing phase
That only time can heal
Don't worry about these troubled days

They'd get, mad at me
Please come with the facts please, for you get embarrassed with your acne
ACME, cartoon references, 90's baby 90's kid
Knew not what the lesson is, knew not what the lesson was
Still watched it because, moving pictures duh
Why you gotta make it complicated for? Like I walk up in the dollar store
That's 100 pennies and they're still tryna tax me more
Still tryna get me more, poorer than I was
I'm 17, reminiscing, on lessons elementary, everything common sensory
Really didn't know the difference between, music and instruments
Eczema's got me itching, for a bold statement

I'm not dreading it, even though I'm Jamaican
Try to move new locations, move a whole nation

Mean it more than Tina Fey, mean it more than dissing tupes
I'm 17 but my brain age is different, I learned that from Nintendo Games
On my side of the microphone, messy inside my home
Strewn clothes, empty bowls
Cause I'm working like a work horse, said that before
Oh well, Just want you to feel the cold like hail
Get slapped if you open up my mail -Mind your business
Miss me with that stupid chit chat, that isn't my class
Not tryna downgrade either, not if I'm tryna meet Jesus
Leave it to beaver, and a couple other leaders
Know what I'm saying? I'm going out of my way to enlighten your brain
If lighting strikes then my knowledge remains, like Benja-MAIN Frank-Lain
Or the remains from the Mayan Age, Link up like chains, or slaves or minimum wage
Minimal phase of visual rage, symbolic sayings'll leave you deranged
A glimpse of a spiritual fray, will you amazed or dazed
I'm saying, I'm trying to sleep past 3, before midday

What's the point of even baking if you don't know what you're making?

You know, with your hat to the back, talking bout your gats in your rap
Yet your wack, with the tracks you put out
What you think of that? So sit back and relax , before you give yourself anthrax
Cuz your raps are just pitiful, despicable, nobodies really feeling you Uhh

Whirling oceans heave in storm

Grasping my hands, white from the fear

To then I hoped to lose again but today
Somebody goes and then I go
Something is shown and then I fall
Nobody knows that somebody knows

Then I feel the calling people won't understand
Myself, I'm scared I will not be the same
Somebody goes and then I go
Something is shown and then I fall
Nobody knows that somebody knows

I thought I could follow the beat
If only I could feel the beat
I'm in line waiting to eat
And I feel I could skip the beat

I thought I could follow the beat
If only I could feel the beat, the beat

So far I tried to keep control of my mind
But now I'm damned to fall and hard to define
Somebody goes and then I go
Something is shown and then I fall
Nobody knows that somebody knows

To back down
And I've gone too far too far
To turn around

[Verse 2:]
And I'm sorry that confusion struck
To blind my common sense
And more than anything I wish that I could say
I won't make that mistake again
And I see patience wearing thin
On my own skin
So please please just walk away
And forget mе

And I promise you I promise you
That I'm not the onе you want
And I promise you I promise you
That I won't be the one that has all that you need
And it's too late too late

And I've gone too far too far
To turn around

Please don't hold me
Please just forget me

And I promise you I promise you
That I'm not the girl that you want
And I promise you I promise you

In the darkest hour of the longest night
If it was in my power, I'd step into the light
Candles on the altar, penny in your shoe
Walk upon the water, transcendental blues

Happy ever after until the day you die
Careful what you ask for, you don't know till you try
Hands are in your pockets, staring at your shoes
Wishing you could stop it, transcendental blues

Out here on this highway, the rules are still the same
Back roads never carry you where you want 'em to
They leave you standing there with them old transcendental blues"

I won't sell spins I just need some suffer in stereo
I'm sick of what I'm hearing

Anybody with anything to say
Has a protocol stuck in their way
So we censor ourselves till we're sick in the head
We live in radio hell while believing it's heaven

Left her cold and lonely

What a lucky surprise
You killed all the pain and gave me your

Remember the time when you were mine

WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR JOY

I was to drunk to drive
We walked in the park
Vampires were falling in love

Remember the time when your smile
Could fight all the demons in my mind
But now you’re gone and I want to protest

WHY ARE YOU SMILING AT THIS BOY

We're lying in a minefield of dreams
We count those sheep as they scream
They never made it over the fence
With each noble attempt, we just sat there conscious
Been the longest, sleepless few years ever
Defeat feels beautiful together
The breeze feels suitable to weather
So for better or worse is working for the better
And we never, ever gave our letters away
Just gained some pleasure from the pain
We ain't some veterans for fame
We aim with the heart, and we never miss a target
And we're playing in the dark with the archers
The robbers, the honor
The offer to never turn the lights on
Better learn to fight long nights
Wrong moves lose battles
When the sun is down, look around

[Hook: Cecil Otter] x2
So look it down, go look down the barrel
Look what you found, the bang for the buckshot
The ricochets graze, the blood drops

[Bridge: Cecil Otter]
So go ahead and look it down
Go look down the barrel of that fun gun
Look what you found
You got no more face
So when the hot sun's setting on a shotgun wedding
I will not tie the knot where the shots come heading
At my head, I will not be caught dead
Walking off to my bed with a death threat

[Verse 2: Cecil Otter]
We got no time to take orders
It just ain't in the cards when you're self-made
No time for an angel on a shoulder
We got to make room for the barrel of a 12-gauge
Self trained, remaining [?]
I wasn't unsure, I was just waiting for the rupture
It never came, so we're playing with thunder
Now we hunger for slumber, we're out and we're hunting
Some thousand-something hounds that are coming
The growlin' run 'em up, now we'll shut 'em up
Proudly pucker up and throw them all a kiss for kicks
Prevail and jot it down quick
And we'll hollar that shit, we'll bottle that shit up
We'll model that did-up, go bottom up, flip out
So get out your gun, ma, let off a couple rounds
Let all these outlaws know we don't fuck around

Can someday come and claim the ring

To keep hanging on when I wanna let go
I wanna know if you actually mean it
Or is it just part of a much bigger show

While I slowly drown

5936,"The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,
As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,
Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam
In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home

The heart of a woman falls back with the night
And enters some alien cage in its plight
And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars
While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars."

They be out here dancing in the snow
Since a kid I always tended to be special
Just special, got me vicious, but blessed though
Easily mistaken for a freak
Was between the cools and the geeks
Didn’t mind to swerve around the rules
I did learn some notions in the street
Tend to hide emotions when i speak

And I sigh when I look at all the good things around
All those untold treasures
And unmeasured pleasures

Sucking on the sweet, sweet flower
And when the sun goes down I got the power to fly...
And that is the only feeling
The one and only chance to get away
From anything that hurts
That's what my manager used to say...
When you came into my sight
I (had to) put on my shades
Cause I was blinded so much
By the light that you spread
And I'm sure it will grow forever
And scare all the zombies away
And since I know we belong to each other
You can try me out cause it gets me on the go
Could we ever hope that we would star tonite
In this crazy show
I know you'll be like no other honeybee
Sucking on the sweetest flowers
And when the night is falling we got the power to fly...

And they're all allegories
For where you go when you are dead

It's where she wants to be
Learning to breathe water instead of the air
I might visit a deep sea diver ambulance driver
Just for a while before i come up for some air
There's so many ways to talk your old self down
And it's a game that i play
Or something to do until i'm in the ground
Falling down
Is up sometimes
Not to drown

She made up her mind
She cleans up the mess she's left behind
And as she takes one last look
She lets out a smile
A little scared but she knows
He's by my side
This is the day, it's finally come
She's on her way, the past is gone
Movin' on to a brighter day
Movin' on to a brighter day
She said it would be hard
Not too long ago
She can't believe that now she's ready to go
There's no holding back
And no holding on
She calms herself as she lets go
Closing the door, she walks away
The past is behind, change starts today
Enter the open door at last
She's not alone, she never was
I know You
I believe You"
4318,"You’ll never know me without a seizure at age four:
Absent eyes, ambulance ride, life: a closing door

No, it doesn't work like that:
We don’t lose ourselves in other people’s worlds
“We” is always “me” and you’ll never know

Sterile smell, fever state, the spirit’s sprawl across the floor
Brain that’s dyed, breakout of hives, grief for their first born

No, it doesn't work like that:
Experiences press heavy against life
I know that “we” is always “me” and you’ll never know

“Go toward the enormous absence of form that is sleep.”

No, we don't grow closer:
Weighed down, honest face from others we all hide
I know, “we” is always “me” and I’ll never know

You’ll never know me if you haven't known the sound
Of paramedics in the house, carrying your father down:
His slurry speech, his fearful eyes, half his face a drooping frown
Your fearful heart and your relief to find he’s still around
“Go toward the enormous absence of form that is sleep”

You’ll never know me if you haven't tasted tears
Over mother’s youngest sister and your best friend, it’s so clear:
At all times, in every moment, death blows in the air
She cries in soup, I lie awake knowing someday we’ll be there"

Nor is it a reaffirmation of the status quo of this nation, no stand for modern civilization and all it's barbaric traditions. This is the final solution to mankind's endless transgression, for earth's liberation a vegan revolution. Beyond the confines and false divisions of alignment with color age or fashion no alliance given to any nation to earth alone is our devotion. Guided by the purest convictions to harm no innocent life for our existence self reliant and free of the addictions that lead the weak on a path of destruction.

Put your life in a box for your sons and your daughters

About a girl who spend her days

Days and days

There's talk of a landslide

To count clocks, call Cleveland
Tell tall tales of where she's been in

Oppressed versus the oppressor but they frame it like it's otherwise
As if both sides are being given billions
Civilians with blank faces couldn't even summarize
Never being numbed by it it just multiplies
Your voice is only heard if it's preceded by a dollar sign
Can only save the West Bank if The West banks
You're only treasured if your treasure’s in their treasury
But our resistance is measured in our energy
So it's forever BDS to do what I can
The corrupted media’s GPS I threw out the van
Ain't no point of us being neutral, standing firm in my stance
If it’s Zionism that suits you we'll be hurting your scam
For as long as their rights are taken and you're perched on their land
We'll be the needles to insert in your hands
[Hook x2]
It goes 1, for the weak and oppressed
2, for Palestine
3, fighting with no regrets
Trying to manage time, we don't have no seconds to spare
While Israeli soldiers brandish all their techs in the air"
913,"You, I think it was half past three
You spilled your Jim and Coke on me
Left the party half past four
Had to sneak into your dorm
Left before the sun had shown
Trippin' all over your clothes
As I shut the door to 213
I heard your voice from the bed sayin'

Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you to
Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you

I always living on the fly
Used to think about you and I
Hoping someday that we could be
I'm thinking  some day that we should be you
I'm tired of wasting time
You probably found another guy
And now I'm messaging your iPhone
Because you're in another time zone
Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you to
Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you to
Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you to
Get back to me, get back to me

Yeah !
Yo it’s your boy Rulz
Gat Tumilz kalashnikov
It’s JUST BARZ my niqqa
That’s wassup my niqqa
Haha, Milz get em ..

[Verse 1: Tumilz Kalashnikov]
I’m an alpinist aiming to the pinnacle of success
I finesse the beat, give rulz some beatins with no stress
Reset criminal minds with toxic words i profess
I’m not impress, my Dms filled with shitty requests
My name rings a bell, funny how bitches runnin outta class
They get played with a likkle sip from a broken glass
I treat them like trash, Nebuchadnezzar eatin grass
That’s why i’m being hated losing all these chances with attacks
Been slept on for long like Giusеppe salvatore
My glorious rise madе them dumb so they cannot talk
I’m highly intensified with the prowess in me
Jovinian outta my league, i’m the proudest king
I create monster pictures with these words i spit, they cannot sleep
The last bite made rulz wanna spit, he brought the beat
It’s guillotine when i raise the bars on a dummy kid
Another massacre in lekki once i drop a hit
[Chorus: Tumilz Kalashnikov]
I dey on my own, nobody ask me howfar
Hunger just dey wire me but i dey on lou lou
If na for the street, una go hear am now now
Just bars just bars, i run pass okada (2x)

[Verse2: Rulz]
The first bar could get u niqqas brain damaged
Used to sit by the corner
Thinking how to go rampage
Reflect this like the mirror
I can show the right image
Lay hands on the Bible
To put chains on these demons
Lines are bitter, not juicy
Nigga this is no lemon
Feel the rage and the anger
As I spit more venom
I'll be the first Gee to put you down from the window
Then your girl heard the news
And shade tears like a widow
She like, Rulz on a high
Nigga on liquor
Can't match you up
I know Tumilz ain't equal
Got u on the scene
I know you'll leave a vivid picture
Put knives in his chest
And made him look like John Q now
Got this heavyweight bars to his chin like AJ
Never lose a fight
I got punch like Mayweather
Can't slow me down
I stuck my foot to the pedal
Yo am showing no mercy if you step into my radar
[Chorus: Tumilz kalashnikov]
I dey on my own, nobody ask me howfar
Hunger just dey wire me but i dey on lou lou
If na for the street, una go hear am now now
Just bars just bars, i run pass okada (2x)

[Verse 3: Tumilz Kalashnikov]
All hail king tumilz, a god in human form
Impeccable fiend, the cause of terror by day or by night
The one that deprived rulz of his right the other night
The one that conquer freddy and jason in a single fight
The mighty art thou who engage in 7some and didn’t cum
Who made it rain at the cross of calvary with a mighty storm
The one who left bitches with a broken heart cos of love
I am rulz nightmare, a fearless leprechaun

[Verse 4: Rulz]
You claim to be a god
But nigga I am the elder god
If this is slugs sharing my nigga I’m takin’ bigga guns
Like derby am playing bitches like a fuckin rival
Your life ended when I bought my first RIFLE
Busy chasing papers
Like Usain Bolt I'ma go this far

Yo it’s your boy Rulz
I’m king Rulz my niqqa
And Tumilz kalashnikov
JUST BARZ my niqqa
That’s wassup !"

But we shouldn't dim our light

Turn those tears into a smile

Heard them lil' threats you sent, they don't mean shit
I'm in the trap on some green shit
Got my unc' on the stove with a mean wrist
Got a bitch in my bed on some freak shit
Come and take your lil' pack on some free shit
Had to pray for a check, on my knees shit
All this jewelry on me, I can freeze shit
Ain't no ""I"" in team, we on some ""we"" shit
Did this shit on my own, I don't need help
Got the strap on my lap like a seatbelt
Secret service cars, I know how Meek feel
Had a lot of friends that ain't mean me well
Sellin' Gushers so I can feed my kids
Work so hard, I just did me like three shifts
Got four cars, nigga, I don't need no Lyft
Got two F&N's and they on both hips
Got two sticks with me, but I got four clips
When I fuck her, I fuck her so focused
Shawty love me 'cause I don't take no shit
She gon' do what I say, I'm controlling
Baby girl, make sure that them legs open
I be cautious, ain't tryna see no pen', yeah

Say you want smoke, but you hiding from me

In a foreign, you know that I'm switching gears
In the studio, I'm my own engineer
Need an addy for P's, you can send 'em here
Feel the walls closing in, I can tell it's near
All this loud in the house, I can barely hear
In designer, 12 locked me up, profiling
I be fresh as hell, I don't need no stylist
Got like 80K spread out in four pockets
Got some CPN CC's in my wallet
When she see them racks, she be like, ""Damn, daddy""
And that BC shit, that there is my family
I'm on drank in the hotel in Miami
Finna buy me some land to grow out in Canton
Sold so much of it that people done took advantage
Wanna go away, wish I could go and vanish
On them drugs, I'ma go to another planet
If you not from the streets, you won't understand me
Niggas plotting on me, they so underhanded
She gon' come in the room with no bra and panties
All my P's gone, I'm feeling so fine and dandy
And the strain that I'm burning is Cotton Candy, yeah
My niggas animals, they ain't got no conscience
Burn a lil' nigga, I'm dialed in
Plus keep a stick for the freak shit
And I got a shop in the district
I was in the projects stressing
All these racks, they a blessing
Every night, I was clutching my weapon

She liked that I talk so artsy
She liked that I speak my mind
I liked that she hated Chris Daughtry
And how she looked from behind
She tatted but just enough to be bad, and she’s not a slut
She doesn’t want any drama, she’d rather just hit a blunt
She wrote her number on the back of my hand
And with no plan, we ran like Jack and Diane

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's down for whatever
Any time, any place, any weather
Let’s roll
Her pops didn’t have a pot to piss in and so she saved up
Bought herself a Honda Civic
Feel like I should know better
But it was over the moment I met her
I never say this type of shit, but…
She's my girl and she know it

Ain’t no bitch like the one I got
Ain’t no bitch like the one I got

Look at what you’ve done to me

She's doin’ it

She don’t need that luxury life, she’s the chillest, yo
All we do is fuck and eat ice cream and cereal
She do it like her shoes made of Nike material
Got my mom saying she wifey material
Quit jumping the gun, Mother Superior
Shit, I’m just humping for fun, nothing too serious
At least I didn’t think so…
I ain’t fall in love yet, I might be on the brink though!

In the lake, on the beach, in the desert
No joke
When she knows I’m secluded in the studio
She’s sneakin’ out of work to send me pictures of her booty
She's my freak Cinderella
And she thinks that it’s weird but I get her
Forget about these other hoes, cuz…
She my girl and she know it

Ain’t no bitch like the one I got

But I know this can’t last forever
I gotta go and I thought that you should know that I just can’t take you with me
Cuz we’re moving too fast together
Slow it down, baby can’t you hear the sound of my heart?
I’m freaking out like a lunatic, you doin’ it!

Would you believe me if I said, “I can save you”?
Would you believe me if I said, “I felt the same pain too”?
Would you say I'm reading too deep, or is this relatable?
Would you let yourself be saved if I opened my arms to you?

Do you receive my love? Is it enough?

Like a child's laugh
Seeing the sands of an hourglass fall
Has a way of quantifying what little life we have
Like time being seen
By phases of the moon
Or seasons changing
An equinox or a solstice
My childhood memories fade
Like emotions
My hope is
They write what I become
A rising sun
Gonna set on a new day
Parlez-vous francais?
Je Ne Sais Quoi
A shooting star lights the sky
Follow its trail with my eyes
It disappears into the night against the darkness
My art is a flicker flame
At light speed it frames the universe
But I'm a servant first
I reflect on the God who is
Explore black holes like we are interstellar scientists
At the speed of sound
The sweetest sound the truth rings loud
A sonic boom
Revealing whats true

I fucked your bitch while I fell down the stairs
I'm fucking on your bitch by the Pasig river
Her pussy stank bad like the Pasig river
Her pussy blow my dick off like a blizzard
But my dick regrow afterwards like I'm a lizard
I'm a workhorse like the Shurе SM58
You're insane like a cult mеmber in Heaven's Gate
I'm top class A-1 while you're second rate
I turned down your bitch I need a better date
Your bitch turned you down you can't get a date
Your bitch left you like you're Bill Gates
Your head cartoonishly large like Big Nate
Your life sad like Greg Heffley from Diary of a Wimpy Kid
Ask how I get all this money, bitch I simply did
I'm into some BDSM and some kinky shit
You're like the suited gimp in Pulp Fiction
Fuck on your bitch I'mma make that my mission
Fucking on a girl for you that's Mission Impossible
I'm rich like Tom Cruise from Mission Impossible

I'm rich like Bill Gates except my wife hasn't left me
I'm rich and awesome and my wife will be sexy
I can't get a husband cause gay marriage is illegal here
I go to a party and I buy all the people beers

You never held me so tightly
Out on a windy night, holding you so tight
You tell me that this don’t feel right

And I’ve seen this face before
The man from next door
And I can’t say I’d blame you
But I’m wishing for some better news
On a summer night

Out on a starry night, throwing down another pint
You tell me that he’s half alright
Out on a starry night, wondering why oh why
You say, oh god, this was never right

Does he know what tunes you like
Or does he always change his mind?
And I can’t say I’d blame you
But I’m wishing for some better news
On a summer night
Out on a windy night, holding on for dear life
You never held me so tightly
Out on a windy night, stepping to the side
You tell me that this was never right

Does he know what tunes you like
Or does he always change his mind?
And I can’t say I’d blame you

3324,"When I started making joke records back in '06
I never thought I'd ever be one of the last lyricists
Categorized with the guys of a genre I don't get
'Cause I rap in English and convey concepts
All these mumble rappers indicate our culture is a void
But the nihilism came from the era just before them
Conscious rappers real woke with a played-out message
Just the stalest of the crumbs dropped down by their professors

You're a house boy doing what you're told, you ain't a rebel
Just a well behaved slave, Stockholm sentimental
Talking 'bout you miss your childhood and place you grew up
I don't
I couldn't wait to grow up and get out of the cult
You say you're sick of the corruption
Giving your support to whatever thief is promising to break you off a cut of the pie that he stole from the innocent and virtuous

Virtuous productive men of genius get fucked
And devoured by the cannibals, hated for their good
Ripped apart and resented
We're rational animals at war with reality, shutting off our faculties
Organized into mobs
Individuality traded for the pressure group, I find it funny
All these real woke folks saying ""Follow the Money""
You're a Marxist Mark, all you see is transactions
Economic groups, intersectional factions
You chose this
Traded gold for government fiat
Fuck following the money, bitch follow the ideas
Anti-capitalist sentiments is hatred of the selfish
Which is hatred of the independent thought
Which is itself a rejection of reason, which is hatred of existence
And these neurotic cowards run the ivory tower

Young minds being poisoned by lifeless professors
Persecuted Jewish bankers that have joined their oppressors
Demonizing financiers that keep us all alive
Hatred of finance and usury is hatred of the mind
Long-term plans, concepts of reality
We nail 'em to a cross so we could regulate the industry
And have a lobby system marry government to business
You wonder why businessmen profit off of prisons

Without reason there's just feelings and the group
So you crowd around a demagogue to rally up the troops
And he tells you you're a victim and you feel that it's the truth
And you wanna ask a question but you're feeling too confused
To know what actually is missing from the picture
You strengthen your conviction that someone at the top's oppressing you
But the ones who really robbed you are college intellectuals
Who turned you to a vegetable at war with the conceptual
It's all psychological extortion
Ever since Kant equated observation with distortion
Ever since Hume cut identity from objects
Now you can't project any cause and effect
You're following the same route as the other clones
Marching forward through history, forgotten and alone
Ignoring oceans of blood, mountains of bones
Altruism speaks, who are you to know?

So you do the one selfish thing you still conceive to do
You cut a rap record 'bout what you believe
And you pretend it's for the cause, for the ones that need your help
But if they deserve your wealth why can't you live for yourself?
Blank out, you feel guilty putting money in the bank
But your record sales are killing it, suburban kids are feeling this
Popping their prescriptions, swallowing your rhetoric
Big pharma got shit on what you're selling kids
Blue pill placebo, stupid and cheap stuff
That works with the mindset they learned up in school
Discombobulated thoughts, narratives and polemics
Over tunes that appeal to both emos and cool kids

You're a boot-licking Dark Age apologist
Get the hell off the stage, boy read The Fountainhead
Let the art be your guide to a Renaissance
Integrate your own mind with the sciences
Or go ahead and talk shit, leave your little comment
'Cause you making fun of Ayn's like a cockroach laughing at a giant
And on the people rituate
Manipulated by the Comprachicos of the mind
That divided into camps with superficial differences
Fighting for the life of a fetus only till it individuates
Or for the rights of a man till it clashes with the will or the visions of a leader

The collective wants to situate, your only barbiturate
Is watching a debate between snakes in a race
Who the fastest could capitulate, these are not smart people
You think they're privy to info but they all need you to feed them
You you're the one filling up these empty vessels
Conservatives argue with liberals argue with socialists argue with communists
Never getting down to the principles under the politics
Never the fundamentals under the postulates
Paternal cousins posing as opposites

United they stand, together we fall
The bed has been made, we're all fascist now
You wanted a purpose, an escape from neurosis
Surrender your thoughts, you'll be told that you're chosen

United they stand, together we fall
The road has been paved, we're all fascist now

Might as well be passed out and dazed when it comes"

I'm all safe, But there's some of us that's stuck in a basement
Tied up, and Angry, and about to go Ape shit
Fuck my life, But why did you have to go you rape it?
Yeah, You gotta past, and Don't try to escape it
Situation was civilized, but it escalated
A Heart may be broken, But fuck trying to save it
Broke thru, and escaped the ropes he was trapped in
He was born a mistake, parents forgot to wrap it
What became of his life, was a shame and tragic
Prejudice all over, why does he get blame from these faggots
He tries to tell himself he's not the same, and not average
He realizes he's different, and conjures his skills
He's still not serious, and says he would be forreal
But, he doesn't think there's anyone he appeals
To, Honestly, that's true, no flow, no beats,but still
He has determination, writes for weeks, barely eats, just chill
Got a burning fire in him, on the streets, he speaks, the deal

Finally, he gets noticed by a major company
Well, it wasn't major, it was small, but something, he
Had a hard time, for the first couple weeks
Then he finally made a song, that to everyone was the fuckin heat
So, so fucking hot, when his album drops, he'll go gold
But nothing stopped, Just grabbing gwap
Moved outta his old home
Moved into a mansion, bought a few new expansions
He let a couple fans in, His is the name they're chantin'
He's proud of how he's standin'
He was flying high so in other words no way he's landin'
Some of his hardcore fans then, just started to say things
Like is he hot as before or is he turning mainstream?
He didn't give a fuck, Cuz he was getting paid, he
Started doing concerts, went everywhere from Moscow to Haiti
More famous, and more famous, until everyday we
Heard more and more about him, He's not even eighteen
Sixteen to be exact, He seemed to be supreme
And he'd never be attacked, People, can be mean
And a matter of fact, A group of obsessors created a team
To catch him...It never succeeded
But, He was hurt by the idea, he felt defeated
Put down the pen and pad, said he didn't need it
Fuck freestyles, too. Our ""hero"" just retreated
Spent years, in an old building, secluded from public
He didn't even hear from his old crew cuz they love it
They got to take his fame, But, he was like Fuck it
He knew what he chose, and wouldn't return for nothin'
But he needed money, now, so he needed to work or somethin
So, instead of return, he got a job at dunkin'
Donuts, nigga hold up, the fuck's wrong with you
I'll get you on a label, and even do a song with you
I was down for the comeback, but then you hit the bong a few
Times, you junkie, That's what you been doing? You're too pussy to punch me
You on meth too? What happened to eating careers when you're hungry
You're all over, no rehab you said
I'm the new closer, but that new rap is dead
Fans said you suck in concerts, you're better in their heads
Went from billboarding, to popping pills and snorting
Everyone's ignoring, you, cuz you fucked up and lost supporters
Even girls who were adoring
Threw away, and burned your posters, they're no longer hoarding
Damn, man, you fucked up, you're no longer important"

Got a hood on it too, which is honestly just
Incredibly convenient

Stealth walk through their sacred neighborhoods

3887,"For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God [Exod XXXIV: 14].

For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God [Deut IV:24].

14. Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you.

15. (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth [Deut VI].

Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen [Ezek XXXVI:5]. God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies [Nah 1:2].


Amongst the many partial anticipations of the modern thought of the transcendental in antiquity is the jealousy of Jahweh. Extricated from its childish psychological constriction—its commensuration to a personal being—this is one of the few religious thoughts to be found in the history of Western monotheism. To refuse to share, to coexist, to tolerate equivalence; these things are ruthlessly divine. In comparison to Jahweh, the God of the Christians is a wheedler; a door to door salesman. It is true, nevertheless, that the genocidal frenzy with which Jahweh asserts his monopoly can disconcert. Squeamishness is not a charge one can fairly bring against him:

1. When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;

2. And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son’ [Deut VII].

16. But of the cities of these people, which the Lord thy God doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth:
17. But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee [Deut XX].

Jealousy is inextricable from paroxystic violence, historically rooted in national chauvinism, before being sublimed into the cosmological intolerance of a divinity. What does it matter who is instrument here? Whether God serves the annihilating designs of a tribe, or the tribe serves to purify the earth of alien gods? There is no antagonism at the origin, but rather a perfect pact between the election of the chosen people and the brutal solitude of the unnameable One.

What the Jews never understood about this God (the Christians understood it even less of course) was the sovereignty of this jealous wrath. How could these feverish rages be subordinated to an end beyond themselves, to a mere persistence, as if God—too—was subject to inhibition? A God that held himself in check, submitting the splenetic extravagance of his moods to the exigency of being, would be something far less glorious than the sun (he would be humbled by a mediocre star). Each creature uselessly dispensing with its existence would outstrip his prodigality, deepening by a ratchet-notch his hatred for himself.

Could such a God glimpsing the impossible sovereignty of his fury—time opening as a dark shaft of impersonal loss—and, howling in utter loathing at the servility of self, restrain from scurrying to a squalid death on the cross?

> God savours himself, says Eckhart. This is possible, but what he savours is, it seems to me, the hatred which he has for himself, to which none, here on Earth, can be compared (I could say: this hatred is time, but that bothers me. Why should I say time? I feel this hatred when I cry; I analyse nothing) [V 120].

Why should anyone be interested in time? I cannot imagine. The scrawniness of an arm, a finger, the enigma of a face; these things make sense (hurt). Time, on the contrary, is as vacant as a marriage, or God alone in the dark.

At the moment I seize myself in the mire of being, swamped by the detestation of ulterior ends, I AM GOD AND TIME LAUGHS AT THE ETERNAL PRETENTION OF SLAVES. ‘This God who leads us beneath his clouds is mad. I know him, I am him’ [III 39]. (Bataille recommends that one chant: ‘I represent myself covered in blood, broken but transfigured and at one with the world, at once like prey and like a tooth of TIME which kills incessantly and is incessantly killed’ [I 557–8].)

* * *

Jealousy is as inextricable from a movement of abolition as it is essential to the being of God. Time cannot be limited to a property or attribute of divinity, for this would make jealousy posterior to a preliminary legislation of essence. It would, in any case, be impossible for God to resent the absolute wilderness of time, since his hatred must pander to the flow of erasure. Perhaps it is that God mistakes himself for time, until he sees things die without reluctance, and turns upon himself in unfathomable desperation. I AM THAT I AM is already a pre-emptive afflux of incinerating privilege, or it is nothing. In the beginning was the rage, or is it that we imagine God being disappointed by his creation? A surprised God? A bewildered God? His great work gone astray. This is the psychological divinity, taken aback by naughty children, the offended God that we tell our five year olds about. A God without wrath, but only ‘righteous anger’. A magistrate. What could such a being fail to botch? But jealousy is not indignation, and at the moment of unfettered rage, when God no longer serves anything, and the molten edge of his wrath delects in the submission of being to sovereign whim, then ‘authority no longer belongs to God but to time’ [I 471].

Bataille writes of ‘the catastrophe of time’ because security cannot establish itself, because time is jealous of being. It is in his early essay ‘Sacrifices’ (1936) that he first develops this thought to its rigorous conclusion in incompletion and collapse. No ontology of time is possible, and yet ontology remains the sole foundation for discursive accomplishment. There are only the shattered spars and parodies of philosophy, as ruinous time pounds thought into the embers of an unwitting sacrifice, wreathed in a laughter as cold and nakedly joyous as the void.

> Time is not the synthesis of being and of nothing if being or nothing do not find themselves except in time and are nothing but arbitrarily separated notions. There is not then in effect either being or nothing in isolation, there is time [I 96].

> [T]he existence of things is not able to enclose the death which this existence brings, but is itself projected into the death that encloses it [I 96].

Time is the suicidal jealousy of God, to which each being—even the highest—must fall victim. It is thus the ultimate ocean of immanence, from which nothing can separate itself, and in which everything loses itself irremediably. The black mass of jealous rage swells like a cancer at the core of the universe, or like a volcanic ulceration in the guts of God, and its catastrophic eruption consumes all established things in the acidic lava of impersonality. We say ‘time’—and become philosophical—to describe jealousy purifying itself of God (but with God purity collapses also).
> Perhaps there is still passion in God, but it is passion as the dog is the dog when the dog is on a leash. There is no possibility for the passion of God to unchain itself, since God is reason. Perhaps the experience of the mystics is in accord with me, because it shows that from the sacred one must leave a place for an unchaining which receives no limits, since, from the sacred, it is necessary to break every species of boundary, to no longer consider limits either of reason or morality as possible. But, once again, at this moment, is it not evident that God dies? [VII 370].

That jealous time erases all things is in no sense the acknowledgement of a dematerialization, since the only place to escape from matter was God. The thought that matter is not a content of time is perhaps the preeminent shadow of a truth that is ‘at once’ an impossibility and an abomination (also an ecstasy). As the shockwave of jealousy ejects the universe’s lactescent debris from the crater of reason, transcendent matter loses the perfection of its inertia (design), and nature implodes into the spasms of its own laceration. As the destroyer the universe is time, and as the destroyed nature, but in the destruction nature sloughs-off the crust in which it had petrified itself and infests time like rot, regressing to its molten core; base-matter, becoming, flow, energy, immanence, continuity, flame, desire, death. ‘Ecstatic time is not able to find itself except in the vision of things that puerile hazard makes brusquely appear: cadavers, nudities, explosions, spilt blood, abysses, bursts of sun and of thunder’ [I 471]. There is every reason to resist such insanity, reason is nothing else. Nothing could be more evidently intelligible than the fact that: ‘no enterprise has cost a sum of labour greater than that which sought to arrest the flow of time’ [I 504]. ‘Civilization’ is the name we give to this process, a process turned against the total social calamity—the cosmic sickness—inherent to process as such. If the deluge, which is danger in itself, is the final motor of history, it is the great civilizations which are the engines or composite machines, channeling flows and engendering the mirage of function. As with an ant’s nest, what emerges in the aggregate is a frenetic immobilism, a literal robotism, converting process into work, and work into the further embalming of process. Everything is set against ‘the explosive immensity of time’ [I 472]. Insofar as a civilization functions, therefore, it becomes increasingly sclerotic and pyramidalized; rituals, customs, codes, all hardened against the release of unendurable forces that would follow from the meltdown of the energy source (which is pushed further and further upstream, purified).

> The long period stretching from the Ancient empire of Egypt to the bourgeoise monarchy of Orleans—which elevates the obelisk in the square ‘to the applause of an immense populace’—has been necessary to man in order to achieve the setting of the most stable limits to the deleterious movement of time. The mocking universe being slowly delivered to the severe eternity of its All-Powerful Father, guarantee of deep stability. The slow and obscure movements of history have their place here at the heart and not the periphery of beings and it is the long and inexpiable struggle of God against time that they figure, it is the combat of ‘established sovereignty’ against the shattering and creative madness of things. Thus history endlessly resumes the response of the immovable stone to the Herakleitean world of flows and flames [I 505].

This is a movement of synchronization; distilling-out an absolute time to provide a form for history without impingement, extrinsically compiling events into manipulable series. Every civilization aspires to a transcendent Aeon in which to deposit the functional apparatus of chronos without fear of decay. What is dammed-up in the Aeon is the densely material time of rupture and ruthless re-creation, whilst what remains to anaemic chronology is time as the medium of homogeneous, commensurable, and reproducible processes; a domesticated temporality adjusted to work, from which catastrophe has been abstracted-out through sublimation into the infinite. Synchronization is founded upon an immense and precarious stabilization; the petrification of a pure and absolute time, or the completion of time as such (the timeless essence of time). Synchronization has as its basic presupposition the Aeon as final register of events, as the perfectly immaculate scroll upon which creation’s unfolding is inscribed, and it is because of this that it corresponds to the servility of God; to his proper function and cosmic duty as bookkeeper of the universe. In other words, synchronization has as its condition of possibility the imperative rationality of the divine. Nietzsche tells us that—even after it has occurred—it takes a long time for the death of God to arrive, but that does not mean it is delayed, rather: it unleashes the asynchronicity whose ultimate repression God was. To be too early—unzeitgemäß—is not at all to wait. It is to suffer the eruption of real time. Neither is death the arbitrary content of asynchronicity; a subject predicated by it. Death is not extrinsically, but inherently, asynchronous.

12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

13. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

14. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

15. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire [Rev XX].

But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death [Rev XXI:8].

It seems that something is in fact annihilated. The end and the beginning correspond. At the beginning was God alone. Therefore things will be brought to a point where there is again nothing but God alone. Thus all creatures will be annihilated—voice of Aquinas’ heretical interlocutor [A XIV 51].

No text has programmed the thought of death in the Western tradition more fundamentally than chapters XX and XXI of Revelation, where its historically dominant topic is established, namely, the ‘second death’, or terminal fate of the soul (see also Rev II:11, XX:6). Augustine’s City of God, written between AD 413 and 427, established the orthodox interpretation of these passages. The ‘second death’ is first mentioned in Book XIII chapter 2 [CG 510], but the decisive text is chapter 12 of the same book, where he remarks:

> the first death consist of two, the death of the soul and the death of the body; so that the first death is the death of the whole person, when the soul is without God and without a body, and undergoes punishment for a time. The second death, on the other hand, is when the soul is without God, but undergoes punishment with the body [CG 522].

He concludes this brief discussion with the words:
> the last or second death, which has no other death to follow it [CG 522].

The second death is thus aligned rigorously with eternal damnation, which is in turn conceived on the basis of the language found in Revelation and elsewhere: the infernal terminology that has provided the West with its imagery of ultimate torment for two millennia. To die the second time is to burn forever, suspended without cessation in the flames of Hell. This infinitely protracted combustion process transcends the terrestrial arbitrariness of the first death, constituting a limit to the operation of the negative; an unsurpassable incendiary horizon.

As is always the case with Augustine, his account is characterized by its vulgarity, gracelessness, and complete destitution of intelligence. This oafish crudity was to provide a crucial model for later Christian discourses on the subject, and captures very well the essentially brutal nature of the faith, which even the more spirited Christian writers would continue to propagate in the mode of traditional authority. Thus it is that Thomas Aquinas—who demonstrates intellectual and literary powers immeasurably outstripping those of Augustine—places those powers in the service of the Augustinian dogmas, typifying the most noble pattern of orthodox Christian culture: that of sophisticating an inherited spiritual loutishness.

It is Aquinas’ stupendous Summa Theologiae—an intellectual cathedral that is perhaps the greatest single achievement of Christian civilization—that Bataille parodies in his own Somme Athéologique (‘everything that one sees is the parody of another, or perhaps the same thing in a deceptive form’ [I 81] as he remarks in The Solar Anus). It is Aquinas’ meticulous construction of the inherited faith in this work that provides the first solid cultural foundations for the exercise of Christian authority, a function analogous to that of Kant in our own age (in which epistemology—or regulated scepticism—comes to replace theology under the impetus of a massive infrastructural transformation of sociohistorical production processes). Aquinas began writing the Summa in 1265, when he was forty years old, and continued it—with intermittent interruptions—until his death in 1273. Far more than the messy, wildly inconsistent, and arbitrarily compiled text we know as ‘the bible’, it is the Summa that provides a doctrinal basis for hegemonic Christianity, and the return to primary scripture—associated above all with Luther— marks the beginning of an inexorable degeneration process.

The central accomplishment of the Summa is that of establishing a rational basis for the Augustinian rantings that had become embedded in the faith, and prominent amongst these is the conception of the ‘second death’ as eternal torment, bound to the doctrine of the soul’s natural immortality (the deepest well-spring of Christian ressentiment). The heart of Aquinas’ argumentation on this matter is found in the four articles of Question 104 [A XIV 35–55], which is arguably the most important text in the entire sweep of scholastic philosophy.

The position Aquinas inherited from Augustine can scarcely be described as philosophical. It is at most an attempt to construct some semblance of doctrinal consistency on the basis of conscientious but talentless scriptural exigesis conducted in the context of an anti-pagan polemic that aspires to persecutory authority. Not that this in any way compromises Augustine’s claim to be exemplary of Judaeo-Christian piety, on the contrary; his rabid intolerance responds perfectly to the dominant tone of monotheistic belief. Nevertheless, one can only sympathize with Aquinas, trying to argue for the rationality of the faith, whilst behind him reverberate deranged barkings such as this:

> But in that last condemnation, although a man does not cease to feel, his feeling is not that of pleasure and delight, nor that of health and tranquillity. What he feels is the anguish of punishment, and so his condition is rightly called death rather than life. The second death is so called because it follows the first, in which there is a separation of natures which cohere together, either God and the soul, or the soul and the body. It can therefore be said of the first death that it is good for the good, bad for the bad; but the second death does not happen to any of the good, and without doubt it is not good for anyone [CG 511].

*

Aquinas’ extraordinarily intricate task was to reconstruct the Christian doctrine of death on orthodox grounds (but this time rational ones), without succumbing to the humanistic impiety latent in the notion of the soul’s natural immortality. Both Irenaeus and Arnobius had challenged this doctrine, considering it incompatible with the absolute dependence of all created things upon God, and even Augustine himself seems at times to undermine it. Once the natural immortality of the soul is questioned, however, it is but a short step to the thought that the unreformably wicked might be simply extinguished— after an appropriate period of rigorous punishment—rather than eternally tortured: a doctrine that Irenaeus seems to have held, and Arnobius certainly did. This is the extreme heresy of annihilationism, later to be associated with the Socinians (who were vigorously persecuted for it) and other Arians. It was considered so heinous a belief throughout the hegemonic period of Christian domination that professing it was literally suicidal, since it merited a reaction on the scale of atheism itself: torture and death (both first and second, although atheists were no doubt more concerned about the first). D.P.Walker, in his discussion of seventeenth and eighteenth century annihilationism, remarks that: ‘atheists and Socinians, who were supposed to believe in the annihilation of the wicked, were generally considered outside the bounds of even the broadest religious tolerance; since they were socially dangerous, it was the business of the state to eliminate them’ [DH 4].

It is thus a mark of considerable integrity that Aquinas—some 400 years earlier— insists upon the (limited) plausibility of the annihilationist case. He divides his argument into stages, first affirming God’s power to annihilate, and only then denying that this power is in fact exercised by a benevolent being (eternal damnation as the sentimentality of God). He concedes, in the first stage of this argument:

> just as before things existed God had the power of not giving them existence, and thus of not creating, so also once they are created he has the power of not continuing to uphold them in existence; they would then cease to be. That is annihilation [Quod est eas in nihilum redigere] [A XIV 49].

Annihilation or—more precisely—the return to nothing, is related to two interconnected concepts of decisive importance to scholastic theology; those of creation and conservation. The nihil of annihilation is the nothing from which creation brings forth the being, since ‘what is created comes out of nothing [ex nihilo]’ [A VIII 41]. Creation both draws the being out of nothing, and holds it out of nothing, or conserves it. The perpetual conservation of the being is a positive and incessant causation that relates it immediately to God, so that ‘[w]ere God to annihilate, it would not be through some action, but through cessation from action’ [A XIV 51]. Annihilation is thus a release from action’, a relapse that has a merely negative relation to God. It is the being’s own tendency that leads it to annihilation, as soon as God ceases to interfere in the creature’s relation with absolute death (which is alien to God, since his relation to nothingness is purely inhibitive). In one sense the being of the creature communes with God as its cause, but as a difference from the nihil the tension of the creature relates only to death, and God’s participation is that of a third party incidentally impinging upon a communication that escapes him. God and the nihil squabble over creation as jealous rivals fight over a shared lover, except that the creature—however much it might respect God—is torn by its desire in quite the other direction, whilst the nihil has all the tantalizing indifference that naturally flows from incomparable powers of seduction.

* * *

The heresy of annihilationism, by ridding itself of the distracting circus of damnation, clarifies the fundamental impetus of Judaeo-Christian monotheism as no other doctrine can. This God is the antagonist of zero, and therefore the fortress of identity, personality, individuation. To be exiled definitively from such a God—to lose his protection—is to relapse into indivisible non-being; decreated into the nihil. That annihilationism has failed to have a significant influence upon Christian orthodoxy attests in part to the tenacious privilege that folk religion and superstition have always maintained over intellectual consistency within the churches, but more importantly, it indicates the voluptuary and disciplinary investment in the thought of the eternal torment of the wicked (exemplified by Augustine).

For the pious annihilationist the perpetuation of existence beyond death is conceived as a reward, reserved only for the deserving, more precisely, the good. More profound than the vulgar empiricity of torment, it is non-being that is the true punishment. The souls of the wicked are subject to the undifferentiable pole of an absolute judgement; simple extinction. For those who remain stubbornly unenticed by the prospect of the long postnecroid haul under God there is thus a surgical and non-penitentiary alternative.

Like all blocks of reactive libido, annihilationist Christianity mapped a displaced active impulse within itself. Utter dissolution is offered as a lure, but safely imprisoned in a system of ethicological exclusion processes; permeable only to that inarticulate ardour which springs from the repressed materiality of the human animal. The taint of evil, or of divine (paternal) disapproval, serves as one barrier screening the ego from the non-image of death. Even more important—because more deeply concealed—is a trap simultaneous with the origin of the logical; that of viewing death from the perspective of God. God—a being—is conceived as thinking both being and its negation with unperturbed mastery, so that non-being is thought through the power of a (supreme) being; as being qualified by absolute impoverishment, and as the inferior pole of a bifurcation within being. Above all, non-being is simply to be thought, and the divine model of logical relatedness secures being in its privileges; adorning it in the robes of methodological presupposition. Death expresses the law, and thus subordinates itself to the highest being. The intellectual neutrality that is thus attributed to God in his comprehension of non-being is the real possibility of a thanatology, or logic of death.

Pious annihilationists are committed not only to the possibility of thanatology, but to its effective existence in the divine intellect, as the absolute pinnacle of reason and justice. For them thanatology is architecturally fundamental to divine law. Such servile annihilation is an eliminative negativity, which can be thought of in two broad ways: either as a formal or as a speculative relation (deconstruction is happy to accept it as either before displacing it). Formal elimination corresponds to a positivity understood as extraneous to its negative qualification, whilst speculative elimination—formalistically (mis)conceived—is the simultaneous inherence and non-inherence of such qualification to positivity. In both cases the content of such a negation is determined by that which is qualified by it, which is the precise definition of elimination. The Spinozistic principle that Hegel enthusiastically embraces as the speculative restlessness germinal in formal reasoning—Omnis determinatio est negatio—means that a positivity is determined by its exact elimination, or, in the words attributed to Hegel in the Zusatz to his lesser Logic: ‘[t]he foundation of all determinateness is negation’ [H VIII 196].

The inof indetermination can only be read as either the formal negation or the speculative development of determination if it is itself understood as eliminative, which is to say, determinate. Such a move is of course—when fully explicit—Hegelianism itself. Quite different is the indeterminate sense of indeterminate negation, which is not eliminative, but ferocious. Ferocious negation is radically heterogenous in respect to the annihilation it effects, so that it is intrinsic to its definition that it cannot be derived from its eliminative consequences by either formal or speculative logic. Far from being topic neutral, logic is reasoning from the basis of secure existence, which is to say, in the absence of time (Hegel thinks history, but not time). The laws of identity, noncontradiction, or determinate negation attain their rigour only by qualifying itself with respect to metamorphosis: insisting upon the simultaneity of logical relations, or the absence of temporal differentiation (asynchronicity). Such a qualification is constitutive for ideality, whether in the weak (scientistic) or the strong (theological) sense. In other words; ideality is nothing other than logical obedience or pure being, and the topic of logic is ontology. It is unfortunate for the logicians that suicide is not a mere decision, but also a technical problem, exemplifying the irreducibly heterogeneous relation between the ‘being’ and its potential for inexistence (which is never even remotely its own). Such a heterogeneity is attested more generally by the struggle for oblivion and the positivity of the sacrificial process. It is the ferocity of death that entangles it in eroticism. ‘The sexual act is in time what the tiger is in space’ [VII 21]. Unlike a logical negation, death requires a complex occasion: intricate conjunctions, the interpenetration of bodies, turbulent flows. There are innumerable ways to die, but this proliferation of routes out of the maze does not lead to the simplicity of a general negative possibility. Ferocity is not reflectively determined through the exercise of a negation, indeed, it has no determination at all, but only a real composition generated in a violent collision of heterogeneous elements, whose issue is a complex synthesis. The various negativities consummated in complex syntheses have no logical equivalence, but only real consistency, or, in Bataille’s terms, community. It is because the realization of expenditure requires the assemblage of a complex synthesis that there is a problem of consumption, finding its inevitable issue in an impossibility, in the sensation of dying or undeath: existence out of excess. Nature, far from being logical, ‘is perhaps entirely the excess of itself [III 219], smeared ash and flame upon zero, and zero is immense."

There's a fog down at Craster
And it's tempting and teasing me there
To be close, to be near you
Just to see how much life I can bear
She's there to remind me
I am just one face in a crowd
High tide will find me
She will wrap me up, in the froth and foam
Like the men of the town
And the girls left home
She's a stormy sea
She's a part of me
And my heart fills up with a salty breeze
It's a memory stirred, circle high sea bird
She's a stormy sea
But she's a part of
Me"

At a great rate that I estimate will escalate
I fear my peers dont wanna hear the truth
Ya drinkin beer, takin clears near the youth
& I'm in the booth, tryin to spread my own word
Y'all nerds saying whats in my head is absurd
Can't be deterred, cuz i've said will be heard
Whether its shit that you dread or preferred
For whatever im saying on the mic i'll be shot
I'll say it how I feel whether you like it or not
It sucks that I gotta be ignored & so neglected
I was directed to the pysch ward like you expected
I won't be respected til a honda accord is collected
Until my flow is connected, restored & is perfected
Drug users are addicted & convicted of crimes
It's not my fault how you depicted my rhymes
So many times, these fools think im jokin
That I won't be taking a drink or smokin"

Do not scare me, 'cause I’m empty

Do not scare me, I’m empty
And cups all in my room with
All the things that make me fade

When I go to bed I think of all the things I dread
And blueblack sits in my head
Close these weary eyes for minutes at a time
Wish I had connected all the lines
Drew my story old
When paper doesn’t burn
When stories remember lores
They told me I wasn’t yours

Thought about trying a little too long

I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I tell you now that I made a vow

'Bout the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
We love so strong and so unselfishly
They don't bother me so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, baby
They don't bother me, said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby

Somebody understands me
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long
Always on my own, now I'm home

My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever

We love so strong and so unselfishly
And I made a vow so I tell you now

It began at 16, way back in the day
I studied the game for 3 years, now I gotta lot to say
Started from the bottom now and I'm making that jump
Finally found my groove and now that I'm pumped

I'm adorning my cowl and I'm slowly getting stronger
The new trend is here, I ain't waiting any longer
The man with a plan putting an end to all the fear
Cause the end of this tape marks the start of my career
[Verse 1: Theadamsmasher (TOLS)]
3 years of doubt, and procrastination
Player envy, backtracking and frustration
I remember I would rap in my room, by a mirror
Just pretending to be great

Hot new ride, rolling in the cake
Just like Wayne, just like Drake
But enough is enough, its time to come up and prove it
And just like Nike, its a grind, let's just do it

Well it's kind of funny, I didn't start till now
But surely, God is the one that knows best
But I also know I have to spread my message
Before God is the one that puts me down to rest
It's kind of ironic, this is the end of my project
But I'm just whetting your appetite on what to expect
From this free mind, with clean rhymes, no need to be upset
Just relax, and rewind, it ain't over yet

Gotta show my generation another way to do things
But they got us in the trap like we're puppets on a string
We're outta control, chasing girls and ka-ching
When our ancestors died so we could spread our wings

But a hero has emerged, yeah I'm back on these streets
Cleaning up the city, yeah I'm back on these beats
Yeah I know I say the same stuff a lot, stuck on repeat
But even God said that man is a forgetful beast

I'm not fool enough to say I can do this by myself
I'm going to need my own league, I'm going to need some help
People from all ages, people from all races, people from all places
Just to put em on that shelf

Yes, the foes re fearsome, the challenge is colossal
But to save the generation all we need is role models
It shows that there are other options out of the bottle
Your name will be remembered, and treasured like a fossil

Positivity coursing through my veins (positivity)
So loud that it sings
Answering the cry for help (the cry for help)
So loud that it rings
They say I got bars and flow just like the hot springs
I tell em: ""I ain't a rapper, but I know a few things.""

Yeah, I ain't a rapper homie (nah)

I lift 20kg's, I bet they probably lift houses

Just let your inner forces win

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells
Prepare your self for the last move
Your past forever concealed
Inhale the future unlock improve
Let all tour senses be healed
So there is nothing we'll ever regret
Using the sense of a blind
This has to be our secret
Be surprised of what you'll find

Emotions are unnecessary
Just let your inner forces win

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells

[Lead: Malmström]

Far beyond the silent dawn
Come join me above the sky
Where no one's ever forced to mourn
Bring on the wonder
A perspective indulgence we'll bear
Weakened by it's strange ling rope
Floating through a spiral of dreams
Incarnating our last hope
Gaining from occult powers
Counting the hours

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells"
1384,"Playing poker hard to make a living
Sometimes are all take
But it ain't no it ain't no giving
Baby no no
Between your legs I know what I'm playing for
So you see my excitement grow
Oh baby watch it grow

My luck is changing
Do you believe it

I'm holding all the aces in my hands that's right
I see your poker faces
I'm a bad motherfucker tonight
I'm holding all the aces in my hands that's right
I see your poker faces stop me stop me tonight
When you're holding all the aces
When you're holding all the aces

I got em, aces
(Solo)

You know baby, I play to win

I'm wearing leather head to toe
Got me a mission and my mission is to rock and roll
I thought I'd let you know

My luck is changing
Do you believe it

I'm holding all the aces in my hands that's right
I see your poker faces
I'm a bad motherfucker tonight
I'm holding all the aces in my hands that's right
I see your poker faces stop stop me tonight
When you're holding all the aces
When you're holding all the aces
I've got them... Aces

7456,"Hotrod car, blood, sweat and grease
'59 is the year of the beast
Danger little girl, can't you read
It says pure evil baby that means me
Highway killer blurring black and flames
And I'm the only one left to take the blame
The road was twisted as a psychopath
Heat as brutal as a shotgun blast
Sudden terror, switchblade sting
No sound but the rustle of a raven's wing
Black air heavy on the tainted ground
The Impala idled as the blood ran down
Interrogation shot me down in flames
But no bodies, no proof - I walked away
No one gets away from the devil's ride
Burnin' like a fever from the fire inside
Highway killer with a hellbound soul
She warms my body
'til he calls me home"
6491,"Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks
And have 'em on the line
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts
'fore you can count from one to nine
I can slip up a great big dip up of lard
From a drippings can
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping
And be back before it melts in the pan

'Cause I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N
Let me tell ya again
I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N

Well I can rub and scrub
'til this house shines just like a dime
Feed the baby, grease the car
Powder my nose at the same time
You know I can get all dressed up
Go out swinging with the M-A-N
Jump in bed at five, sleep 'til 6
And start all over again
'Cause I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N
Let me tell ya again
I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N

Well now if you come to me sick
You know that I'm gonna make you well
And if you come to me all hexed up
You know I'm gonna break the spell
And if you come to me hungry
You know I'll feed ya full of my grits
And if it's loving you want
I can kiss you and give you the shivering fits

'Cause I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N
I'll say it again
I'm a woman...
W-O-M-A-N

Well, I got a twenty dollar gold fee
That says there's nothing that I can't do
Well, I can make a dress out of feeding sacks
And I can make a man out Of you

And Shoutout to anyone who listened to this far in the mixtape

[Verse 1: H-Bass]
Mixtape's done, but I can still rap a couple bars
It's H-Bass, jacking off at self help seminars
Check my faggotry, from an all-boys academy
In the showers, with an quick lesson about anatomy
Big things are coming my way like Johnny Tsunami
So mommy turn off parental control and let me watch some Toonami
Nonchalantly, I've been jerking it to some Sailor Moon
Crack is my snack and I eat it by the tablespoon
Me and Nelson swerving in the Outback
Subaru, listening to the Tarzan Soundtrack
I Be Dopeness dropped like my balls at age eight
Getting Lit to Lit, no shit, it's Spring Break
[Hook:]
I Be Dopeness x 16

[Verse 2: H-Bass]
I really think, I really think, I'm turning Japanese
No place like the nieghborhood, on her knees at Applebees
Rap battle me? Nah, I rhyme crispy like tortilla chips
And I'm as white as drips from the tips of a gonnarhea dicks
As told by Ginger, I'll end your career so quick
That when you're about to drop hot spit, you'll do the opposite
I'm positive, the Kosby Kids, will help these children run amuck
Crashing in my pickup truck, go go gadget give a fuck
Turn me up, Turn me down, Bitch I'm coming to your town
I know what the ladies like, I'm not afraid to ""buy them root beer floats""
I know, I look forteen but my license says 92
Perfectly legal, all you sluts, let's have a rendevous
I'm on to you, your on to me, let me say this honestly
(That I will blow a dude, 50 bucks, no questions asked)
No, don't try to haggle me, Bitch I'm back in Applebees!
To prove to my stepdad that what a good rapper I can actually be

[Outro: H-Bass]
So this is my last 6 lines, I better give my thanks
To Delaware, Littlefoot, Nelson, and my boy Bangs
To Karnivourous, Young L, G-Spot, and Diamond Cut
And shoutout to that fast rapping motherfucker Bustnut
We've killed a lot of tracks today, let's get out stories straight
Hi, My Name's H-Bass, and that's a Kosby Kids mixtape"
8721,"[Verse 1]
Now... who got the beat that makes ya bump?
And who got the thump that makes ya cum?
Well, I got the funk that makes ya bump
So we gon funk this motherfucker right on up
Well here's a toast to the boogie while I step on in
So put your lighters in the air and let the smoke kick in
I got the motion, the potion
And once Priest hit the groove everything is in motion
We coastin through the neighborhood and lookin around
And all of my homies on lock down, or either underground
Man, I done found the only way to put mine down is to dip, skip with the homies from the Dogg Pound
Sup, Bow-Wow, how my nigga feelin?
Oh, I'm on the money mission to get a pocket full of millions
Like Sicilians, we do it mafioso
Doggy style, Dogg Pound, Death Row is the logo
I do it by my lonely cause I'm true to the code
Plus I die with the homies cause that's all I really know
Who started with me, who departed with me
Through thick and thin we heartless-ass G's
Regardless, let's see with bifocals, don't try the locals
And y'all wonder why they despise my vocals
I Fold you like crystals, rap spittin like clips do
When I dismiss you, me and my click, fool
[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?

[Verse 2]
To be a high rolla, you need a pistola
And about a half a key of some Coca Cola
Now that I got older, I got a little colder
And I don't trip to get a chip off my nigga's shoulder
Man dreams of a gangsta, being like Cagney
Or Bogey for Snoop Doggy
Ain't no follower, man, I'm a general, so when I put it down I gots to be so original
I'm quick to bust, just like Daz Dillinger
But that's the little homie, and I'm the big homie, Snoop Don Corleone
Spittin three words up in lightning
As long as I'm bouncin with this I know you likin this
Fo' sho tho, you can't take my photo
I'm layin around in the DPG in a grey fo-do
Get pushed around downtown in the back of a car
The Double R from the dirt to the stars

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
[Verse 3]
Well in verse three, the worst see?
After part two, know when I start the clock there be a heart, too
And just the two of us, gonna show you how we do
I thought you knew we bust
I demolish, stay polished, got no time to rust
No dividing, multiplying cause it's never too much, like Luther
Cause ya see ain't no loser
That can get the scoop on the Super Duper Snooper
I refuse the tactics, you ain't used to drastics
I choose to mash like Land Cruisers
You know I kizick the bomb digga-dee, bomb-ba-zee
They can't get with the D-O double G
You know MC slash master of ceremonies
Runnin thangs, pullin strings call me Snoop Pesci
Lesson, blessin', stressin' manifest me
Don't wanna test me, I'm guaranteed to let it rest, see?

[Chorus]
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I (may... I), may I funk with you?
May I?"
3741,"[Verse 1]
Baby who are you to me?
Baby who am I to judge?
By how you've been with me lately baby just isn't enough
Why have you broke me down like this?
Why don't you let me steal your kiss?
You should never be like this
I really miss the older you

[Chorus]
And I still fall and I will fall until I fly
And I will fall until you catch me
Or I will fall until you try
And I'll still look out for your heart
Lookin' for it like it's mine
Because my heart is still with you
But where my heart is so is home

[Verse 2]
We have come to the end of our road
And I have found peace with myself
And now I put this love on the south side
Baby high on that shelf
But it's still one grab away
So if you ever change your mind
You can run back into my arms
If you'll love 'til the end of time
[Chorus]
And I still fall and I will fall until I fly
And I will fall until you catch me
Or I will fall until you try
And I'll still look out for your heart
Lookin' for it like it's mine
Because my heart is still with you
But where my heart is so is home"

Did I see your face, like it wasn't there
And I know what went wrong
Yeah, I knew it all along
But I didn't care about you

Clara, where are you today?
And did you make the same mistakes
That I made a million times before I met you?
Did you go, did you run, did you think of your son?
Did you know you're not the only one
That tried to make a piece of coal into a diamond? Yeah

So everything's fine now, at least you say
Maybe that's okay, but you know it's wrong
Was I right, did it last?
Were you dwelling on the past
Or hanging on to a memory?

So you say your time will never come
Maybe you should go ahead and jump
Then you'll become
Exactly what you are hanging onto
Standing there on the bridge with your feet on the ledge
Maybe I might push you over the edge
And send you falling straight to the ground"

Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails

I'm dudein' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails

Shinin' gold to me

I was blessed by her decree

You were every moment's magic
Joy beyond compare
You were all the rays of sunlight
I was lost without a care

Victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

So we lived our days in rapture
Like the world could never end
We weren't thinkin' 'bout the future
We had time enough to spend

We were blessed as though in heaven
We were messengers of joy
There were angels all around us
There was none who dared destroy
Victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

Then the world collapsed around us
And the tables overturned
We were lambs before the slaughter
We were driven out and burned

Yes, the world collapsed around us
And the archers found their mark
We were victims of the fury
We were shadows in the dark

Yeah, victims of the fury
Shadows in the dark
Oh, victims of the fury
Arrows found their mark

Feel soo good every time ah ah
Peak just climb wanna close my eye
Good kush when it's floatie in yo spine

Rotations gliding through the clouds, Let's fly!
Take a trip to see what it's like to be high

Take a trip to see what it's like to be high
Oh you ain't feeling aight?
This will get you by
This will solve you all night
Light the torch, your problems don't excite
Call some friends up, you be on them invites
Drive to a look-out, smoke some more with a view in-sight
Views of the water, reflections of the city lights
I'm dreaming of a better life, trying to do what's right
Bill's got me thinking that, everything in life is overpriced

Should I pick up from where I left off?
My absence found in the calendar dates crossed
Still I ain't give up, shit I might re-invent myself
Being never satisfied
That's my fuel to propel for a greater cause
Trying to rise above y'all
Most artist haven't found happiness after the curtain calls
Depression something I don't want to involved
Tired of the cycle, submerging myself into that hole
Shit get's old, but what lengths' you willing to go?
People lose it all and still ain't get shit resolved
Gave up everything cos they didn't give themselves, a protocol"

Since 13 a chunky n*gger on das mean
I used to eat a tray dus and a duc duc
And boublerap and mac in my backpack
Lounging in the back smoking sacks and sidekicks
With my sidekicks rocking high kicks
Honey want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my cat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, cause niggas eat a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Begging and ducking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is...

Party... And bullshit, and...(etc)
Hugs from the honeys, pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sage that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my reices
Sure do, two .22's and my glue
Holler if you need me love I'm in the house
Roam and stroll see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, ho hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a Bad Boy

Nigga you scared you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast you, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to sing a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jack got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm eating skins again
Rolled up another ball, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon

Exactly when I was told denial
Turn around and face your boogie man

Coughed up a dead one
Hardly half bred

To my Dizzly Doo Dah head
Celebrate the way that I'm coming back
Took a while to trace
I'm not loving this bloated life

Give the gal a badge for courage

To comprehend her plight
Despite her selfless side

Yeah!
Killa' K-Town, Los Angeles
I'm not a gangster though. (I AM!)
Feel me?
X is........
I guess
Yeah! Check it!

[VERSE:1]
Ayo! Straight coming at ya'!
New found rhythm with a passion!
When you hear this you all gotto' put your hands up!
And wave 'em back down
If you feeling me now
Just know that I'm giving it to you WEST COAST STYLE
(Ow!)
Ever since I was a little child
I never thought that I would be where I am now!
Rappin producing or rocking a crowd!
My life is now music and heavyiest sounds!
Expressing the lesson of an adolescent
Los Angeles K-Town is what I'm reppin'
So when I grab the mic I don't check it
There's no point Rem still gonna wreck it!
But never stress it
I Grab the microphone
I'm in the zone
Leave me alone
This the type of high that I'm on
In other words this is where I belong
Making all my troubles be gone
Like a magician man just listen!
I'm writing with the tip of the point, don't miss it
My mission: is to keep it true to myself
As long as I have beats I don't need no help!

West coast in the house!
LA's in the house!
When we up in yo' spot they saying
(Ohh Boyy!)
Cuz they know that
West coast in the house!

When we up in yo' spot they saying
(Ohh Boyy!)
Cuz they know!

[Verse: 2]
I give it to ya! (How)
Style original with the flavor
Get a little taste!
This the recipe
Rest in peace to whoever else I could be
Cuz Ima be doing this until the death of me
It's a passion
Takin' action
Everlasting
The feeling that I get but it never to pass
On top of that
I relax
My laptop on my lap
I Sit back and kick raps
Danger!
Is what I'm always surrounded by
But my purpose is worth it
When rehearsing these verses
Future is always lurking
To see if I be working
I am
RemGee be killin 'em man!
But never will I sell my soul for little change
Cash rules everything around me
(C.R.E.A.M)
Cuz I raised on the west side
The LA mess side
Where shit is corrupt man no lie
But I just get through it
With help of the music
This is why I use it
To get me shooting
Out to LA so they know how I feel
As long as the ink spill man I speak for myself
[Hook]
West coast in the house!
LA's in the house!
When we up in yo' spot they saying
(Ohh Boyy!)
Cuz they know that
West coast in the house!
LA's in the house!
When we up in yo' spot they saying

Cuz they know!"

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul"

Well now, it's three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Three o'clock in the morning
And I can't even close my eyes
Can't find my baby
And I can't be satisfied

I've looked all around me
And my baby, she can't be found
I've looked all around me, people
And my baby, she can't be found
You know if I don't find my baby
People, I'm going down to the golden ground

Goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
Oh, goodbye everybody
I believe this is the end
I want you to tell my baby
Tell her please, please forgive me
Forgive me for my sins"
5000,"[Chorus]
Don't look down
Cause love will take us higher
Baby you turn my world around
We're flyin' now so don't look down

[Verse 1]
Well the story begins, it's all needles and pins
You see the girl give him a fright
Blew up like dynamite
A partner broken in his heart
Trashed him right from the start
So he's pushin' this relationship apart

[Verse 2]
So she said
What's your problem?
Look in my direction
Give you quality good love and affection
Make you mine give me time
Let's get it on
Here goes (here we go)
[Verse 3]
So he opens his eyes and like a kind of device
He's realising that she could be the one (woohoo!)
So his fatal attraction caused a mighty reaction
And I guess the only way to go was up
Check it out now

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is a crazy thing
It can make you lose your mind
But that won't happen this time
If you leave your past behind
So baby

[Chorus]
Don't look down
Cause love will take us higher
Want you to be
Closer to me
For every day until forever
Say you will
Cause you are my desire
Baby you turn my world around
We're flyin' now so don't look down

[Verse 4]
Uh uh come on now
Uh uh here we go
So now he wants to get a little romance
But if he's gonna get it then he's gotta take a chance
It's plain to see she's got the key
Like when Harry Met Sally it was meant to be

[Verse 5]
So she said
Now I gotcha
Knew I had to have ya
Skies the limit
Higher and higher
Moving up
Never stop
Comin' down
Let's go
Here we go

[Verse 6]
So together they'll be
Like the fish to the sea
Never separated or be apart (no way)
And they'll sleep with a smile
Never waking [?]
Yeah they know they're never gonna look down
Check it out now
[Pre-Chorus]
Love is a previous thing
Gotta take it when you can
There's nothing that you can not do
When love is close at hand
So baby

[Chorus]
Don't look down
Cause love will take us higher
Want you to be
Closer to me
For every day until forever
Say you will
Cause you are my desire
Baby you turn my world around
We're flyin' now so don't look down

Let's take it to the bridge
What bridge?
This bridge!
Hey hey so come on now
Hey hey here we go

On the road with a trunk full of Asher Roth
We gon' pop Rosé when the package off
I swear to god I went and got the bay crackin y'all
But I couldn't do it without LA backin' doe
Niggas say they gon' get me, I laugh it off

Lock it down make 'kon throw away the key

8169,"The things you don't do shine so bright
Like flashlight in the middle of the night
The things you do well blend in like
Camouflage in the shadows of others light

Your hard work is barely seen
Hiding your stress behind the scenes
Always confronted about the things
That everyone sees
You barely hear a positive thing
At times it feels as if
You're living out a bad dream

Never though this feeling would last so long
Feels like a roller coaster going on and on
No stopping point nearby
So you stay in one place a cry
Missing a shoulder to lean on
Wishing someone was there to lean on

Blending in like camouflage
And no one knows where to find you
People stare you straight in the face
Yet they don't see your face
The things you don't do shine so bright
Like flashlight in the middle of the night
The things you do well blend in like
Camouflage in the shadows of others light

Working hard in the dark
In the light you miss the mark
Like shooting blanks at a target
Or grocery shopping with empty pockets

It doesn't add up, when you actually try
No one's around to cheer you on
When you make a mistake
You can't catch a break
When the pressures on you feel the heat
This is your chance to really speak

So ready to prove yourself, take a step of faith
Every eye is on you standing in the spotlight
But then you make a mistake
And all eyes turn away;
Laughing as everyone walks away

The things you don't do shine so bright
Like flashlight in the middle of the night
The things you do well blend in like
Camouflage in the shadows of others light

Sat upon my grandpa's knee
And what do you think he said to me?
When you awake you will remember everything
You will be hangin' on a string
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You sure can take to the left or go straight to the right
Save your days and use your nights
Be careful where you step, and watch what you eat
Sleep with the light on and you've got it beat
When you awake you will remember everything
You will be hangin' on a string, yeah
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know
Ollie told me it's a mean old world
The streets don't greet you, yes, it's true
But what am I supposed to do
Read the writing on the walls
I heard it when I was very small
When you awake you will remember everything
You will be hangin' on a string, and
When you believe, you will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know, no, no
Wash my hand in lye water, got a date with the captains daughter
You can go and tell your brother, we sure gonna
Love one another, oh! It's okay, it's alright, yeah, yeah
You may be right and you might be wrong
No, I won't worry all night long
Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night
Ain't no reason to hang my head
So I could wake up in the mornin' dead
If I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood"

Yo DJ Man, are you ready? (I'm ready!)
Are you ready? (I'm ready!)
Are you ready? (I'm ready, i'm ready, let's go!)
Party people in the place (Yo)
I'm here to say (That)
My DJ (Yeah)
Goin' all the way

[Verse 1]
Well, he's no quiet storm, and he's not no joke
When he's on the turntables he goes bezerk
He's comin' through, so get out the way
I'm not talkin' about me, it's my DJ
Using his hand, takin' command
Like I said before, he's DJ Man
The tough DJ that's comin' through
Homeboys in the back, tell me what'cha gonna do

[Verse 2]
He can't be beat, he's on a tour undefeated
When you hear him cut, it's just best that you retreat
Sittin' on the throne, in a class of his own
The jazzy females don't leave him alone
I'm not grabbin' on my man, but you know he's (Fresh)
And when he's on the turntable, he let's the crowd go
When he's on the cross-fader, his hands move swift
They movin' so fast, they can't be played with
You know he's tough, he's DJ Man
He has the two turntables, it's where he stands
You sucker DJ's will fear him, when you'll hear him
You know he's devastating, and you can't get near him
The best man reppin' on the wheels of steel
Slicing it up, 'cause he knows the deal
The M-A-N, I won't say it again
For all you sucker MC's, who want to be my friend
DJ Man is on the mix, you can't forget me
'Cause i'm the MC dominator MC Shy D
[Verse 3]
I see you paid your money, to hear us play
So we gonna get down, with no delay
'Cause in first place, that's where we'll be
DJ Man, and myself, Shy D
We are the two on the top, we can't be stopped
And if you ever try to battle, you'll be dropped
We don't play games, you know we come correctin'
And all the crews out there, give us most respect
DJ Man is tough, he don't say much
Comin' comin' through, we'll be caught in a clutch
'Cause super party rocker, DJ upsetter
When he's on the cut, he's gotta get better
Cool on out, picture what I say
My DJ, is goin' all the way
'Cause he's a tough DJ, that's on the top
And when he's on the turntable, he can't be stopped
So Man, it's time to settle the score
Show them what you're back there for

[Outro]
Now all of y'all, you must confess
That my DJ, he is the best
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hah!
Yo DJ Man, cut it up DJ!
What's my homeboy's name?
Kool Collie in the house
'Cause 2 Live Crew is coolin' out
J-E-C, rock, fillin' the house
Auntie Anne, rock the house
To my mellow Luke-Luke, rock the house
Yo, DJ Man Homeboy, i'm breakin' out"

In line when everything's at stake
But I won't have the final say

Watchin' your mistakes from the wake

I'm not the kind of guy to put up a front
But touch what isn't yours and I'll fuck you up

Innocent, deceptive

He passed the blunt in the name of paying homage to ancient knowledge
I bluntly passed and said our forefathers would not acknowledge
The self-destructive lifestyle we living goes against common logic
But fuck it, we be on it constant like the Project
In a world where fast money's the object
Because it leads to sex and other ungodly conquests
How you finna tell a nigga there ain't no illuminati?
It's simple: you get your power quick, just gotta sell your body, or your soul..
That's if the media ain't taken it already
They deadly, they take your head and run it through with a machete
So now your bran's screwed, it's all about being cool
And 'fuck rules', false 'I love you's and everything new
Just imagine if I own an iPhone
And if I don't get the new nice one, my life's gone
Keep in mind I've owned every version since its inception
Your mind's under possession of the corporate deception

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
School and I never saw eye-to-eye like iris
The principle's I'll get more pupils if I'm on my third eye shit
But they, would rather censor me, the truth must be their enemy
Like: ""stop asking smart questions; that's stupidity""
Oh really? Well I apologize for my higher mind
The only solid element on the rise like iodine
Though I ain't dying anytime soon
This my reign of terror, bout to bring the fucking monsoon to these goons
Then the white man lie that every innovator must have been bleached
But you accept it cause the falsehood's been rooted so deep
You mention Afrocentrism, they tell a nigga ""don't speak""
Well I seek, the true skin colour of Adam & Eve
The end of the world's coming, now they all wanna be holy
Now they wanna party with G-O-D
Well, I pray to God that Jesus got a soft spot for these hypocrites
Cause the way I see it, these niggas ain't getting shit
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's too soon to be acting like Illuminati
But when I'm thirty, triangles and dead bodies
We be chasing the dollar sign upon which lies
The riddle riddled pyramid eye, Free Mason ties
Starting a fire like Cremation
Which is to raise the stakes or meet your maker like Creation
...(business, religion)
...
Funny, last week I saw my pastor at the strip club
Today his sermon's bout how everybody need to get love
Our God, Allah and Jah are the same
Ancient hate smothered the brotherhood and made us place the blame
...
I'm guessing you and I both know even the truth's a lie
Living in a super paradigm where only few survive
... Might as well go for suicide

While daughter bear pours porridge
But I swear that it didn't do shit for my hunger
And so I'm still starvin', still pondering pot it is, [?] carvin'. Ballet slippers indented with more than real arches
Mind's eye shreikin' and sharper than six steel archin'

And I related to him but I'm still the ville's larvae
Trapped in the wilderness call me Will Darkness
Fortune got sanctioned by a curse that led me to believe
That I'm eviler than the first match that classified
The Devil's rebellious army as Fallen and the
Stone monsters is still callin' my name
Print cursive and always spill margins
It's a shame that the tall shamans are still bawlin' from
The bad critiques that they all got from the drill sergeants
Figure so sleek his pockets could feel larger
Than a 5 bar clan that's mockin' the Ill's armour
No. No. No fuck that
Not with it, hot meta jams just to talk
Spittin' Ox with his prophetic plans
At least in the Chinese Zodiac, flow so heavy
Pickpocket it, it will throw you back out the window with the Narcotic in the forty sack, a quarter is like a quarterback
He [?] more hoes than the mustang wrench
The swish been worked like a bloodstained branch
World scream when I get hurt but the cut stays red
Well if I bled that, pneumatic anatomy so it sheds black
Yeti make-up, the veteran's lace gut ruptures
Rap faggots get mad hattin' for fake lustre
Probably spit Busta as venom as a cliché

Can put you in a place where you been before
And leave you lyin there like a begger Knockin on the door

I thought I, had escaped this pain in my heart
But it knew right where to find me
Like a ghost in the dark

Thats why I hate nights like this
It makes me want to be in love
I hate nights like this
When you can count the stars above
And theres no one to kiss
I hate nights like this

Its alright, I'll be ok
I'll just wait for the clouds
Hit my knees, pray for rain
Just fall down
Maybe the moon won't be so bright
When it stairs into the sun
Never know I got even when the morning comes
But I'll just deal, with what im delt
Cool wind in my hair
Standin' here waves crashin' in and the clean smell of salt air

I hate nights like this

5647,"And I saw the white horse, ridden by a man with bow and arrow
And he wore a golden crown and he rode a trail so narrow
And he went forth to conquer all the liars, thieves and cheaters
All the weavers of illusion; all the bigots and mistreaters
And the earth was shakin' like an old man's hand and the sun was black as mud
And the oceans moved across the land and the moon became as blood

And I saw the red horse and a rider with a saber
To take peace from all the earth, for destruction was his labor
And he rode out in anger to turn brother against brother
With poison for the nations to make them all kill one another
And the stars of heaven fell to earth like the fruit of a tree that's shaken
By an unkindly wind, to be ever more forsaken

And I saw the black horse and the rider with the balance
To separate the works of man; his vices from his talents
A measure of wheat for a penny, three measures of barley in kind
To divide the one from the many, but hurt not the oil and wine
And the heavens parted like a scroll, when it is rolled together
And the mountains were moved out of place like a whirlwind blows a feather
And I saw a pale horse, and Death was riding on him
And Hell was right behind him, and no mortal man outshone him
The kings of the earth and the mighty men; the glorious and greedy
Hid themselves in the blackest hole with the homeless and the needy
And some priests and some television preachers lay down with the vile unholy
And some senators and movie stars shared a cave with the meek and lowly
And they cried to the mountains

Fall on us! And hide us from the face of him
Fall on us! And hide us from the face
Hide us from the face of him

Fall on us! And hide us from the face of him
Fall on us! And hide us from the face
Hide us from the face of him"

I didn't wanna rush
Moving slow
Didn't think about it much
Moving slow
Guess it wasn't love
Moving slow
It wasn't enough when push came to shove

You been steady makin' me feel
Like everything been moving slow mo, don't you say no
Maybe we weren't real
Too busy tryna make it seem like it was low key 
But now I can’t breath
Cause I been swimming in these dreams of what we could be
Call it bad timing
But I just had get this off my chest, I can’t rest
Moving slow
I didn't wanna rush
Moving slow
Didn’t think about it much
Moving slow
Guess it wasn't love
Moving slow
It wasn't enough when push came to shove

Moving slow

Didn't think about it much

Yeah, man, it's Nine, man, live from the trenches, man
Happenin'  with my boy Durkio, man
He  the soul of the streets, man, I'm the voice of the streets, man
I'll be back out there going crazy
Bro was there when wasn't nobody there, man
You  know, payin' lawyer fees, you know, sending bread, whatever, on bro
Holding  a motherfucker down, man, doing his thing for me
All you fu' ass niggas out there snaked out, man, on some fake shit, man
Remember  all the real niggas
Showed love, man, stayed down, shout out to real niggas, man
Y'all know I'm on my OTF shit, man, on go

[Chorus]
They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You  really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Varney stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (Turn up)
[Verse 1]
I'm the brains and you the muscle, that's Varney still
And niggas really speak they mind off them Perky pills
They left me hanging and left me abandoned, that shit hurt me still
We fell off and it was a shootout, and I think they'll murk me still
In the studio smoking exotic, comin' up with new bars
I tried to stop it, I tried to stop it, that shit too far
Been around with my brothers, you give me endurance, I ride with two Glocks
And I'm thinking 'bout getting insurance, tryna do me like 2Pac
Ooh, it hurt my soul
Who gon' ride with you 'til the end?
Then again, you gotta watch out for your friends
They disrespect me on the 'net, don't pay it no 'ttention

[Chorus]
They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Varney stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (Turn up)

[Verse 2]
Gotta be a snake to hang around you snakes
Boona gon' be straight, you know that's my lil' ace
If you play with my name, the streets gon' give you a taste
Just signed my deal with Bel-Air, fuck around and give you a case
Niggas low-key Chuck E. Cheese, tryna give you a case
A lot of pussies in these streets and I'll never embrace
You talking like you an OG and you can't get replaced
They wanna see your face in the casket, I told 'em leave your face
And I be thinkin' about my dawg until them Runtz gone
Until a nigga shoot that dome, it won't be much long
It's not a letter to the streets, it's just a love song
Lost Baby D to these streets, can't believe my cuz gone
[Chorus]
They told me don't die young because I'm talented
You really for me, you been around and you ain't asked for shit
Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Varney stand on it

Let's get it
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger"
1609,"[Verse 1]
Infinitely caught in a weave of, 
Tryna dip around what they breed before you leave or, 
Climbing in and out of a scene they call elite or, 
Lining up whoever's between the world and me or, 
Me and the world, whichever first when pronouncing it, 
Taught us ""get enough for us all if you come out with it"", 
The background eat till it's gone if you all around with it, 
Tryna get a piece off the corner like quarter ouncing it, 
Caught up in the bounce of it, where loyalty is all that it oughta’ be
Like if I was to call and see if you down for it, 
Word to a dresser drawer burying what was found in it, 
Truly forever yours ever more if you doubted it, 
Ever more like more than you was ever surrounded with, 
To get involved makes you apart of the sound of it, 
No regret at the door and no announcing it, 
Fucking with whatever you about with it 

[Chorus]
Forever in a day, forever in a day, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, however we should aim
Forever in a day
[Verse 2]
Forever ever, forever ever, 
With short change measures, in all day leathers, 
And honor's like forever ever, forever ever, 
Your alibi know to keep it Andre clever, 
And being on mean we ignored what all they left us, 
And it starts out being as on as Rae Sremmurd, 
Bare minimum, the feeling of ceilings that never left us, 
But the chicken box will kick off the top for whatever weather, 
For the win of it, corner get loud, they caught wind of it, 
And everybody caught in the sound that you was whispering, 
Send something flying around to help them get in it, 
Or how that's still yours if your name ain't on the end of it, 
Loyalty is priceless, jewelry isn't, 
Give or take, depending on what type of jewelry you're given, 
In a space, where the script is stuck to like a pivot, 
If you knew us then you knew we was with it when it’s 
Forever in a day 

[Chorus]
Forever in a day, forever in a day, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, however we should aim
Forever in a day
[Verse 3]
Broad day like jumping out in the way 
When one is jumping up outta the front and finding it's aim, 
Or, divying a bag with who you're beside every day 
And splitting points like you dotted your name, 
'cause know that all of these green lives that used to be here, 
Matter like these black lives that these blue lives shoot outta fear, 
So all these green lives used over here, 
Was 'posed to set it where never would a second set of shooters appear, 
The first set is just the usual here, 
It makes sense as much as it kinda don't but that's new to who, where?, 
The prestige, of feeling like you're who they let breathe, 
Due to a bag that you shouldn't have, it just seems, 
Like more than they’re letting on to, 
Finger fucking money resorts to thinking that it adores you, 
Whatever you make of it, make it where it goes around with you, 
In light of where all these go arounds put you, forever in a day"
718,"[Verse]
The future's unclear
Demons are near
Snitches is listening

Snakes in the grass
Stuck in the past
Thinking disparaging

Thoughts and feelings
My meaning, I'm steaming
I mean it
I'll do it, I'll do it: I'll stomp you out

Don't you make a sound
You try to scream and shout
But get a fucking Clue
I'll do it in the study with a dirty pair of shoes

I'm a spade to a diamond
A spade to a club
I'll eat out your heart
You've got something that makes me jump man
Press start
Donkey Kong Kart
Crash Bandicoo-coo
When you walk in the room

But secretly I'm boo
Secretly a king
Know that I'm a god
Kratos with the jaw
But less defined like Maw
So really nothing like Kratos
Except I'm still a god

And I don't even mod
This talent's for real
But I still know the Konami code so if I need to kill you
Make you squeal
Slip on my banana peel

I'm really forcing these lines to fit with the rhythm but
Fuck it Nathan Deal

Born in '42
82nd governor since 2011
His lieutenant is Casey Cagle

4801,"[Verse 1: Last Emp]
1993, shortly before Thanksgiving
I got the call, she said ""Jamal, Derek is not longer living""
Softly she spoke, is this a joke? Man you gotta be kidding
As my question was raised this explanation was given
A meaningless death made me question the meaning of life
Does my body remain at rest like when I'm sleeping at night?
Will I burn in eternal hell or will I find paradise?
Be rejected or ressurected like the body of Christ?
Is it like purgatory, the story described by the Catholics?
Or Nirvana that Buddha sought in both theory and practice?
Like I studied in my college philosophy classes
Or do my molecules and atoms travel back to the gases?
I mean, what I'd like to know, is where's my spirit go?
After the curtains close, on my final show?
Is there a pain it brings? Enjoy my favorite things?
Visit ancient kings? Hear the angels sing?
Who'll answer these said the great MCs
My man Grym who's battling a debilitating disease
He said you see a brother like me is willing to fight
And everytime I question death my only answer is life, nigga fight
[Hook: Esthero]
One life, yeahhh
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment?
Am I living righteously?
It gets haaarrdddd
But I know I got to keep on
I'm trying so hard to be strooonnnggg

[Verse 2: Poetic]
Paralyzed on the bathroom floor by pain
Last month I endured, but now I can't ignore
Feels like railroad spikes being stuck in my liver
Am I dying? Eyes crying, body starting to shiver
Crawl upstairs from the basement calling my sister
(Sniff) Dawn help me, I ain't feeling too healthy
Stomach walls burning, head spinning and turning
Waiting for the EMS; 3:10 in the morning
Rush me to the emergency screaming like a newborn
The pain's too strong maybe my soul's trying to move on
They hook me to the I.V., put me through some X-Rays
Gave me Demerol to kill the pain that was the next phase
Early the next day in the hospital room
Moms and pops in the room, three or four docs in the room
Uh; test results suggest your colon and your liver
Is so cancerous you got three months left
Me and Death is playing chess ever since then
My strength is the Most High, my fam and close friends
The Last Emp and Set Free blessed me with a verse
Staying healthy comes first, look at me, things could be worse
[Hook x2: Esthero]
One life, yeahhh
And my God will set me free
Am I living in this moment?
Am I living righteously?
It gets haaarrdddd
But I know I got to keep on

“The Release Party!”
“It’s L.A’s finest, Dilated Peoples.”
“The Release Party!”
“Get it right, we ain’t never left
We’re still here...you’re rocking with the best.”
“The Release Party...Dilated!”

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Butterfingers, they’re fumbling, killing us at the cylinder
Devilish how they deal, the selfish, the sinister
Sniping from the Avalon--you can hold this
Heart pumping ice water, they don’t know what cold is
This is show biz: more like pimp and ho biz
Hit the stroll, get the dough (Act like you know, bitch!)
Darkest before the dawn, lights out the darkness
The story’s old: ‘The plight of the artist.’
Wipe the sleep from my eyes, I must of dozed off
Jump back on my feet (Stretch!) Brush my clothes off
Send the invitations out, we celebrating now
Contract fulfilled, y’all, Dilated breaking out
[Evidence Speaking]
A record deal, is just a key to a door, that opens up a lot of bullshit, OK?
Right now, live and direct ,with Dilated to the people, direct, with no middleman right here
So we are independent and we are off our label
And we are celebrating that

[Verse 2: Evidence]
I went from wrong side of the tracks
To encores back to back in two cities
Third show tonight, headed for a hat trick on stage
This year, there’s no fucking with me
Spit witty, Babu, Hit me!
The way my crew cuts, it looks like Britney
Cut O’s and split the, profit
Burn big, my eyes may get misty
Release toxins, I get boxed in
‘Dilated’s Dead?’: Not an option
Not a small glimpse, or chance or thought in
The back of my head, rumors of death, y’all lost it
The greatest show on earth
And when we in Houston at the dome it’s the greatest show on turf
Catch the screening, the old building leanin
It’s the tower, when the shit falls I watch it falls
[Outro]
We are no longer signed to a major record company, OK...(Cheers)
No labels, OK. Make some Noise...We are fuckin done!
“We are free..we are free...Free at last, Free at last, thank God Almighty we are free at last.”

We not changing that shit, man. We ain’t going no where
Don’t get it twisted, don’t get it fucked up...Big up my man C-Sick in the place to be

Still rocking with the best y’all, it’s the release party
We celebrating this shit right here...it’s no tears, it’s no tears...

Brilliant iron of blades and armours

I've been watching you lately
I've seen how much you care
And you would give yourself away
To anyone who's there
How long have I known you, baby?
And kissed your smiling face?
How long have you been coming round to my place?

Love ain't easy for me, and we're too hot to last x2

You always find your way back to me
I always find a way to fall for you
You always say that you'd never leave
I always say that I believe
And when we danced together, I saw it on your face
The way the kisses were burning us from day to day
And how you'd come to me and stay till 4 am
Who knew that our forever will never remain?

Wit no union, and no benefits no dental plans
I can't eat off no hundred grand
I got cavities dat need fillin'
You can't feed a nigga Peanut Chews
Now put ya feet up in a nigga' shoes
A lack of green'll give a nigga blues
A sip of purple make a nigga rude
Make a drunk person sing a sober tune
(I can't go on this way)
Fuck dat, I can't do it man
We make these tips off this gift that we cursed wit
But then my mind drift, am I defeatin' the purpose?
Cuz you feel like shit when you miss your son's first shit
But who gon pay the bills? supply the meals? no surplus
My baby mama give me drama on the daily
Like she making it barely and my kids is eating rarely
(I can't go on this way)
I'm stressed out going through it I can't do it
If you put puppies in the oven, do that make 'em biscuits?
Put hungry dogs in the kitchen, will they eat the kittens?
Do you hear me or you listening? there's a big difference
Do you catch the lines and the hooks or are you still fishin'?
These a couple questions that I need to be answered
Like is these Backwoods and weed givin' me cancer

I'm stressed out going through it I can't do it
My momma say I got her nerves stressed
Got her waking up in cold sweats
I'm hard-headed and iron
What make it worse my lil brother behind me
Blood pressure running like Harriet
She can't handle it
I got her screaming Lord Jesus like Mahalia
Son I'm tellin ya please don't let me bury ya

I'm stressed man, I'm goin through it
I was taught trust in the Lord but still tie up your camel
Use your tongue as your sword and your books as your ammo
But when them bullets start flying and you got pussies around you
And who you rely on, let them niggas surround you? shit
And make me feel like young Tinner, from the start I was finished
How a nigga start wit a finish and begin wit a endin' ?

I'm stressed out, I can't take it no more
I'm moving ass backwards with no forward progress
Feel asthmatic like treadmill FIFA jogging
Stagnant, running in place is tragic
My heart in the faith I don't practice
I still pray Allah, forgive me for my actions
Cuz I spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Kaffir

I gotta still feel feed my young'n's, so keep huggin

I can't wait until the rain turn to sunshine

Came too far and I ain't going backwoods for nothing
I ain't being distracted by nothing
Midget-size to Dikembe, I ain't backed up from nothing
Ma I'm still stressing
It ain't the kid it's the bills stressing, she hold it down on her own
She hold me down at the crib, hold me down while I'm gone
She hold me down as a kid, hold me down while I'm grown

I choose not, refuse not, down on my own
Now off the streets, runnin wit the hottest label in the industry
The hottest label got a nigga lot of enemies
So now when I go in baseline
A nice-size ratchet to throw in wasteline
I gotta make mine
My bills ain't getting paid in, kids ain't situated
(I can't go on this way)
Ya'll better make a decision before us
Cuz the way that we living ain't all good
Ran away wit them hating ass niggas don't like us
Despite them, we gon do it regardless
But all this commotion they causing, I ain't with it
(We ain't with it)

So you think you know the answers?
You think you’re pretty cool?
We’ll teach you a lesson, it’s exactly what you need
So turn off your computers – listen to me and believe!

Long ago the Fathers left the earth
For a world we call Utopia, the land of second birth
And the ones who stayed behind
Didn’t listen so they died!

Now there are some who still believe that life abounds on earth
Their foolish dreaming threatens all the Fathers have preserved
If you love Utopia
Then everything you hear, everything you see – tell us!

“Alright children…
Boys of the left…
Girls on the right…
Form a straight line…
Now march!!”
Now rest your little heads and know the Fathers watch over you
They’re watching your every move

“Recess is OVER!”

Congratulations on your first day of school
So you think you’d know the answers?
You don’t know the answers…
You don’t know the answers!"

To discover who we're meant to be

6228,"Finding #2: Extreme Racial Disparities in Marijuana Possession Arrests Exist Across the Country: Blacks Are 3.73 Times More Likely Than Whites to Be Arrested for Marijuana Possession• In 2010, nationwide the white arrest rate was 192 per 100,000 whites, and the black arrest rate was 716 per 100,000 blacks.

• Racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests are widespread and exist in every region in the country. In the Northeast and Midwest, Blacks are over four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites. In the South, Blacks are over three times more likely, and in the West, they are twice more likely. In over one-third of the states, Blacks are more than four times likelier to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites.

• Racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests exist regardless of county household income levels, and are greater in middle income and more affluent counties. In the counties with the 15 highest median household incomes (between $85K–$115K), Blacks are two to eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites. In the 15 counties in the middle of the household income range (between $45K–$46K), Blacks are over three times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites. In the poorest 15 counties (median household incomes between $22K–$30K), Blacks are generally 1.5 to five times more likely to be arrested.Racial Disparities at the State Level• The states (plus the District of Columbia) with the largest racial disparities in marijuana possession arrest rates per 100,000 are:

   Black Arrest Rate    White Arrest Rate    Times More Likely Blacks Arrested

Iowa                1,454                174                8.34

D.C.                1,489                185                8.05

Minnesota            835                107                7.81

Illinois               1,526                202                7.56

Wisconsin            1,285                215                5.98

Kentucky              697                117                5.95

Pennsylvania        606                117                5.19
Even at the “lower end” of the spectrum, the disparities persist. In Oregon, for example, the state with the fifth lowest disparity, the Black arrest rate (563) is still more than double the white arrest rate (271).

The states, plus the District of Columbia, with the highest Black arrest rates per 100,000 for marijuana possession were:

Black Arrest Rate

Nebraska 1,699
Illinois 1,526
D.C. 1,489
Iowa 1,454
Wisconsin 1,285
Nevada 1,272
Wyoming 1,223
New York 1,192

• While the Black arrest rate for marijuana possession was under 300
in only two states, Hawaii (179) and Massachusetts (61) (following
decriminalization), the white arrest rate was over 300 in only three states: Wyoming (376), Nebraska (365), and Alaska (318). In only 10 states was the Black arrest rate under 500, while in no state was the white arrest rate over 400.

• Of marijuana possession arrests in the District of Columbia, a staggering 91% were of Blacks. In Mississippi, 69% of all marijuana possession arrests were of Blacks. In Georgia and Louisiana, the numbers are 64% and 61%, respectively. These figures are further illuminated when taking into account the difference between Blacks’ percentage of marijuana arrests and Blacks’ percentage of state populations. In Illinois, for instance, Blacks make up 15% of the population, but account for 58% of the marijuana possession arrests. Similarly, in Alabama, 60% of the marijuana possession arrests are of Blacks, yet Blacks account for less than 25% of the population. In Kentucky and Minnesota, Blacks represent only 8% and 5% of the respective states, but 36% and 31% of the marijuana possession arrests.Racial Disparities at the County Level• This report examined 945 counties in the United States with at least 30,000 residents and where Blacks make up at least 2% of the population; these 945 counties represent 78% of the total United States population. (26) Of these counties, in only 37 (or 3.9%) is the white arrest rate for marijuana possession higher than the Black arrest rate. In other words, in over 96% of the counties examined in this report, Blacks are more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession.

• The counties with the largest racial disparities in arrest rates for
marijuana possession are not necessarily in the states with the largest
racial disparities in arrest rates. For instance, Missouri has the 40th
largest Black-white arrest ratio (2.63) of all the states, but in St. Louis City, MO, one white person is arrested for every 18.4 Black persons arrested. Georgia has the 21st largest racial disparity (3.69), but in Gordon, GA, the ratio is one white arrest for every 14.1 Black arrests (or 136 white arrests per 100,000 as compared to 1,921 Black arrests per 100,000). Ohio is 16th on the racial disparity list (4.11), but in Allen, OH, Blacks are 13.2 times more likely to be arrested than whites. Kings County (Brooklyn), New York has the 10th largest racial disparity in marijuana possession arrests at 4.52); 161 whites per 100,000 are arrested, whereas 1,554 Blacks per 100,000 are arrested — a ratio of 9.68.
• The counties with the highest Black arrest rates for marijuana possession are spread throughout the country, from Campbell and Kenton, KY, to Worcester, MD; from Dare, NC, to Livingston and Montgomery, IL; from Onondaga, Broome, and Chautauqua, NY, to Chambers, Kleberg, Hopkins, Cooke, and Van Zandt, TX.

• 92% of marijuana possession arrests in Baltimore City, MD, were of
Blacks; 87% in Fulton, GA (includes Atlanta); 85% in Prince George’s, MD; 83% in Shelby, TN (includes Memphis); and 82% in Philadelphia, PA.

• These staggering racial disparities in marijuana possession arrests
exist in many counties irrespective of the overall Black population. For example, in Lycoming and Lawrence, PA, and in Kenton County, KY,
Blacks make up less than 5% of the population, but are between 10 and
11 times more likely than whites to be arrested. In Hennepin County, MN
(includes Minneapolis), and Champaign and Jackson Counties, IL, Blacks
are 12%, 13%, and 15% of the population, respectively, but are 9 times
more likely to be arrested than whites. In Brooklyn, NY, and St. Louis City, MO, Blacks comprise 37% and 50% of the residents, respectively, and are 12 and 18 times more likely to be arrested than whites. In Chambers, AL, and St. Landry, LA, Blacks account for more than twice as many marijuana arrests (90% and 89%, respectively) than they do of the overall population (39% and 42%, respectively). In Morgan and Pike Counties, AL, Blacks make up just over 12% and 37% of the population, respectively, but account for 100% of the marijuana possession arrests."

Over it. Positive vibes then smolder it
In our essence, we’re free
Cancel madness with our vibes and kill it benevolently
And evidently, we give autumn leaves to the winter’s tree
The bohemians, living. Minds are what freed us from
Belittlement, self-balanced. Enlightened high through the medium
Discipline and control undid that hinge on the soul that locked truth in, so
Now I’m high on life, just sit binging, I stroll so unusual
Through the world. Time and I truly quarrel
My mind is the ruthless squirrel
In this tree of life designed to close futile flows

Participated everyday in class, but the neocortex was hindered speechless

It always used to make me smile
Sometimes I would say it
Just to hear the sound
I used to love to see you smile
It always made me feel so good
But now your smile is gone
And the love's all been lost

But the hardest part
Of a broken heart
The hardest part of a broken
Heart the hardest part
Of a broken heart
Is pretending it doesn't hurt

Look away from memories
That stare at me from everywhere
Even when I'm alone
It seems you're there
I'm running from the things
That hurt
I run away from everything
I'm tortured every day
By the things I once loved
But the hardest part
Of a broken heart
The hardest part of a broken
Heart the hardest part
Of a broken heart
Is pretending it doesn't hurt

Pretending it doesn't hurt
When I see you on the street
And you can't look at me
Anymore
Pretending it doesn't hurt
When you try to say hello
And I need to touch you so
You'll never know

But the hardest part
Of a broken heart
The hardest part of a broken
Heart the hardest part
Of a broken heart"

To come near no one really dares
She's conscious of the watchers around

Out of the forest densely dark
With strange beauty shining bright
Sneaking up without a clue
She felt warm inside

With a sudden blow of wind
She'll go out and dissapear
Nothing left, no single trace
They'll keep watching out

She's dancing in a forgetful way
To come near no one really dares

Using power like a queen
Turning faces into stones
When they're looking up"

605,"1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces

2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In desperate position, you must fight.

3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must be not attacked, towns which must be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.

4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.

5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted with the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.

6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying his plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will fail to make the best use of his men.

7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of disadvantage will be blended together.

8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.

9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune.

10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; and make trouble for them, and keep them constantly engaged; hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.

11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.
12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.

13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war.

14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation."

Your breath the only friend
Chattering others surrounding you
You're going out again
It's a laugh and a gas new crowd
You tell yourself
While buttoning up a new red shirt
It's been a twenty years of doing this
Just the same night into night
Day into day
With your preset mind

[Verse 2]
Wake up with a preset mind
With no self control
And you decide to call the Roll Call
Of the socialites who mortified
Can't see as far as their next surprise
Yah, happy with nothing but the sweet F.A. of the night
Believing that they're alive and well
But if asked
They have nothing to tell
Except the words of a clashing rhyme
I'll calmed and out of sync
Even real sounds like a zero
To a brain in lip sync

And I knew it was the groan of mortal terror
It was not the groan of pain or grief, oh no
It was the low, stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe
I knew the sound well

[Verse 1]
Threatened in the night by ghouls who wanna spook me
This ain’t feeling right, it’s nothing like in the movies
Shaking with my fright, and desperate to make a move, see
I don’t wanna be here to find out what they would do to me
But I still remain, taking the beating
All these demons make me feel insane, thoughts are repeating
All these demons make me feel insane, thoughts are repeating
All these- aw fuck, now the creepy’s increasing
Now I’m frightened of the demons that be clouding my vision
Senses heightened, and I’m freaking seeing things, and now I know they’re listening
One condition, I’ma leave before they even know what’s missing
Dishes in the kitchen, and they notice out the door I’m skipping
Slam that shit behind me, now you wonder who’s the fucking villain
Fall into the booby trap; I don’t know what you’re revealing
If you’re gonna murder me, I’ll leave you will a final feeling
I will make your mission fail- kill you, never find you dealing
Go ahead, now, keep on taunting and we’ll go from there
You continue talking, so there’s no more burdens I can bear
Nestle in a hiding spot, find a place they have to spare
You can try to find me, bitch, now look inside the master chair
If I’m feeling fine, then I know my mind is safe
Desperate for the time, find a clock, I see it’s getting late
Almost eight, early wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
Ending of the first day, I hope the second’s just as great
[Chorus]
Up and down the halls they’re scaring, frightening and they’re overbearing
If you don’t believe in them, you will not be seen again
Relationship ghouls are not caring, halt your problems with red herrings
Now they hope you’re seeing them, now you will believe in them

[Verse 2]
Lately when I’m writing rhymes, they’re appearing kind of dark
I don’t know what made me do it, demons tearing me apart
Influential people have been making me renew my art
Take a scary shot in the dark, and guess at who they are
Inspire the uninspired, change my music like the tides
All the hidden meanings that you’re finding once you look inside
Understand what’s on my paper: these ain’t all the tears I’ve cried
Multi-syllabic rhymes, sounding like a Disney ride
Reach out for my teddy bear for comfort ‘cause the thunder’s booming
Look him in the eyes, and the fucker started talking to me
“You ain’t getting out of here alive” he said, over the music
But I’m trying, still give an effort to escape the feuding

[Chorus]
Up and down the halls they’re scaring, frightening and they’re overbearing
If you don’t believe in them, you will not be seen again

[Bridge]
But you should’ve seen me
I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him
[Verse 3]
So, I made it out, but they’re still chasing me
Screaming loud, thumb is out, pray a cab is saving me
Flag it down, driver’s pointing me into the vacant seat
I’m escaping now, thanking God He found a way for me
But as I begin to breathe, something’s feeling kind of off
He just turned the car around, and turned the radio way up
Recognize the song and I feel my skin begin to crawl
It’s the same exact one, playing through the haunted halls
Now the driver laughs, acting like there’s something scheming
Taking off the mask and revealing he’s the fucking demon
Slamming on the gas, right into the wall is where we’re speeding
Right before we crash, I wake up; I guess I was dreaming
Sweat dripping, wet imprint, laying in my bed
See it as I’m standing up; all this shit was in my head
That’s the scary part: all this shit was in my head
“Just a dream” I say to me, trying to ignore the dread
Now I calmed down, won’t be sleeping for a minute
When I close my eyes, feeling like I’m right back in it
Still feeling dizzy, head hurts, and the room is spinning
Back in bed; the spirits in my head are unforgiving
Try to fall asleep, but I lay there for a little while
Can’t seem to do it and my mind is still going wild
Use a technique back from when I was a little child
Reach out for my teddy bear, I see his face form a smile
Shit"

I just wanna leave so I can be free
You don't know my name I got two IGs

I been gettin lonely in the city
I would drop it all for you
Baby you’d see
And I don't trust my demons
They don't faze me
I been going crazy ever since 16

[Verse 2]
Ever since I was young
I just wanna feel like I meant something
Nothing, I know I'm nothing

Whatever you want me to be I will be that
Wherever you want me to go I will go there
I just need something to hold on to
Something to hold on to"

I love you with all my heart can take
I hold you beside me in my sleep
And long to be dreaming endlessly
We've come into a place and time
Where I am yours, and you're mine
A circle filled with love

[Chorus]
If you come away with me
I can show you ecstasy
Close your eyes and be with me
And love will follow
Take a chance and hold my hand
I know you'll understand
We'll find a special land
And love will follow us
Hey, hey baby

The smile on your lips and in your eyes
A stranger adrift in paradise
You touch me and slowly move away
Take all of the night you need to take
Baby, wait a little while and see
All you mean to me
I've waited all my life

If you want to walk with me
I can show you ecstasy
Close your eyes and be with me

Use your wings to fly away
And come with me today
Your heart will lead the way
And love will follow us

We never feel it this way)
I always wanted to love somebody
As much as I, I'm wanting you now
Ooh... oh now, now

Where I am yours, and you're mine

All those crying brats, playing and screaming
Decided to clean our streets, to get rid of ém all

Disappear they did, I kidnapped them all
Hid them in my basement, none was found

I never knew - They could haunt me
Nite after nite - Dead children carry on screaming my name!

It all just turned worse, I got hornier every day
I oiled their dead rectums and raped them constantly
The smell was sickening so I wore a gasmask

I was convinced, they all wanted this
I swore eternal love, fed them my cum

8254,"(as Performed at Las Vegas)

Senorita Nina, from Argentina, knew all the answers
Although her relatives and friends were perfect dancers
She swore she'd never dance a step until she died

She said, ""I've seen too many movies
And all they prove is
Too idiotic
They all insist that South America's exotic
Whereas it couldn't be more boring if it tried. ""

She added firmly that she hated
The sound of soft guitars beside a still lagoon
She also positively stated
That she could not abide a Southern moon

She said with most refreshing candor
That she thought Carmen Miranda
Was subversive propaganda
And should rapidly be shot
She said she didn't care a jot
If people quoted her or not
She refused to Begin The Beguine when they requested it
And she made an embarrassing scene if anyone suggested it
For she detested it

Though no-one ever could be keener than little Nina
On quite a number of very eligible men who did the rhumba
When they proposed to her she simply left them flat
She said that love should be impulsive, but not convulsive
And syncopation had a discouraging effect on procreation
And that she'd rather read a book and that was that

Senorita Nina, from Argentina, despised the Tango
Although she never was a girl to let a man go
She wouldn't sacrifice her principles for sex

She looked with scorn on the gyrations
Of her relations who did the conga
And said that if she had to stand it any longer
She'd lose all dignity and wring their silly necks

She said that frankly she was blinded
To all their over advertised romantic charms
And then she got more bloody minded
And told them where to put their tropic palms

She said, ""I hate to be pedantic
But it drives me nearly frantic
When I see that unromantic, sycophantic lot of sluts
Forever wriggling their guts
It drives me absolutely nuts. ""
She declined to Begin The Beguine though they besought her to
And in language profane and obscene she cursed the man who taught her to
She cursed Cole Porter too

From this it's fairly clear that Nina, in her demeanour
Was so offensive that when the hatred of her friends grew too intensive
She thought she'd better beat it while she had the chance

After some trial and tribulation, she reached the station
And met a sailor, who had acquired a wooden leg in Venezuela
And so he married him, because he couldn't dance

There surely never could've been a
More irritating girl than Nina
They never speak in Argentina
Of this degenerate bambina
Who had the luck to find romance
But resolutely wouldn't da-
A-a-a-a
A-a-a-a
A-a-a-a
A-a-a-ance
She wouldn't dance

2570,"[Verse 1]
Stoop livin' was a heaven that we fit in
Summer sun, we would run far away from our fears
Waiting for the train in the winter
Couldn't hide and our trees were froze in tears
Mama said she'd always keep us warm
Roof over our head, even though it was torn

[Chorus]
My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt

[Verse 2]
Bought my first keys at fifteen
Not for a car, play my songs at every shitty dive bar
Big dreams in the biggest city
She don't care if you ever make it far
Mama said, ""Don't ever lose sight
Stay true to your voice inside""
[Chorus]
My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt

[Bridge]
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough

[Chorus]
My Queens is a queen
Not talking bright lights and shiny things
But we always made it work
Building castles out of dirt
My home is a throne
Not very pretty, but tough as stone
And we always made it work
No matter how much it did hurt
[Outro]
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough
But we all lift each other up
Learn to shake the demons off
Conquer all this world throws at us
'Cause love is strong enough"

I play nights in the Spanish part of town
I've got music in my hands
The work is hard to find, but that don't get me down
Rosalinda understands

[Hook 1]
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies
In Rosalinda's eyes

[Verse 2]
When she smiles she gives everything to me
And when she's all alone, she cries
I'd do anything to take away her tears
Because they're Rosalinda's eyes

[Hook 2]
Señorita don't be lonely, I will soon be there
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And I've got a chance to make it
It's time for me to take it
I'll return before the fire dies
In Rosalinda's eyes
[Flute Solo]

[Verse 3]
All alone in a Puerto Rican band
Union wages, wedding clothes
Hardly anyone has seen how good I am
But Rosalinda says she knows

[Hook 1]
Crazy Latin dancing solo down in Herald Square
Oh, Havana, I've been searching for you everywhere
And though I'll never be there
I know what I would see there
I can always find my Cuban skies

Place is packed, having a blast
Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind
Then the door swings open, I looked left
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest
There goes my good time

[Chorus]
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me
Making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
Forget this damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

[Verse 2]
It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now
Looks like I'll be hanging around
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd
[Chorus]
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me
Making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me
All I want to find me is a waitress to pour me up a shot of
Forget this damn night, and everything we've ever done
Where's a corner booth when I need one?

Maybe one in the back with the sear torn
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor
Cause, I know you're on the dancefloor baby

Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide where the neon don't hit me

3562,"My ev'ry thought and wish was thine;
Alas! thou know'st too well—
The ties that bind thy soul and mine,
How lasting need I tell.

Oh! I have lov'd thee tenderly—
Too dearly love thee still!
I feel that thought can never die—
That wish no time can kill.

The life that spreads before me now
Is one vast wilderness;
No fairy vales the scene can show
That smile to cheer and bless.

All dreary spreads the frowning waste—
A desert, gloomy, bare;
The rugged path, when found at last,
Leads on but to despair!

No streams, that cool the parching breeze,
Spring in that desert rude;
Save those the fainting Arab sees,
That glitter to delude.
Or if some smiling view display'd
Would tempt my hope again,
I know 'tis but an empty shade,
And sigh to feel it vain!"

I feel like I'm going crazy... oh shit...
[Verse One]
Back at ya, steal your fuckin' necklace and run with it
Fuck ya'll if you ya'll think I got what it doesn't take, if you fake being an asshole but I'm one, I ain't gonna deny
Lie, for that fact I'll die but come back like Jesus and there's no reason why
Dear, you better get my shovel from outside because I'm gonna dig fuckers and burn that part of the ground
Hear no sound, it's nighttime but a street car driving past
Seeing you ugly out from the window, I shout back but can't see his face so I don't know if he is too so I just assume, I go back to my room and write another song til the day comes to doomsday
Zombies battling with me, it'll be Graham of the Dead
I'm the fucker that will make you dead if you fuck with me
I'll fuckin' slash your throat if you ever mess with me boy, you got nothing on me so fuck you if you wanna get the best of me
[Hook]
Win like a champ, you got nothing to lose
You got to take it all like a champ
It's time to take your place and claim your winning
Win like a champ, you got nothing to lose
[Verse Two]
This is the survival you need, when you battle you gotta try to win but if you don't and if you survive then try again
Battle to the end, win like a champ then you'll feel great as anything
You got what it takes and you should just put your feet down and win
Hen, you need to get your shit together and get your swords and don't be a quitter, get up and start to battle til you become a winner
Embrace, the feeling that you face, no disgrace when you take what's rightfully yours
Sure you'll succeed, indeed man
I know I'll succeed and I've battling my way through too, I gotta see through the flow, no time to go but at least trying your most best at what you do
Right on track, don't bag your bags cause quitting is not the right thing to do when you've been gettin' there and there's no turning back when you do, I'm trying to get there and know the fact there's no turning back the time... the rhyme that I spit in time on a line that I wrote and I feel fine... I feel so insane
I feel head pain, it's called an headache, face facts when I rap my tracks
I just feel like I'm gonna sing songs like I'm slayin' it good, I'm playing the game good when I be the top dawg, ain't putting the rhyme at rest but rappin' the most best rhymes at best

Win like a champ, you got nothing to lose
You got to take it all like a champ

I refill my dreams, blow up like a TNT bomb when I drop f bombs
Fuck you if you think that'll I'll not explode, I'll load ya fuckin' brain with codes that you wanna crack but can't
Be like 007, I'm Bond... James Bond
Shaky, shaky martini but not st, st, st, st, st, st, stirred
Feelin' like I'm gonna go damn crazy like I'm already am
Don't stay calm, I could be like Hulk and turn green and bulk bodied
Versing myself in a made-up battle
I'll rattle ya mind til the marbles get mixed up
I mixed up my own cup with a friends cup but shit... I guess that way I just fucked up
Puttin' my life to the edge with a knife from the kitchen
Saw a dead kitten and wanted to bury it, fall on my fuckin' ass and slaughter shit
I slaughter tracks, make my own crack and sniff it without gettin' the kick and high
I am about to cry because my shit is in a mess, I mostly feel depressed
It feels like a fuckin' knife to my chest, ready to go through the other side of me
My blood dripping and I'm mind trippin', shit I'm just pulling your leg and falling to my almost dead and come right back up man

Juggle my high hope up top a tightrope
Both Fingers crossed just hope this last
Bury my burdens and all that's uncertain underneath leaves and  the greenest grass
Pacing worried always in a hurry
In the fast lane hoping  I don't crash
Lost my bearing sanity tearing can't get a hole on my self control

You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You looking good girl, go, go, go get 'em girl
Go, go, go hit 'em girl, go, go, go, go, go, go
You shut it down
You shut it down, down, down, down, down...

[Part II]

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way, oh
What can I do, to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl, I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not tryna say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it, girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

[Outro: Drake]
Lay you down, down, down
I’m tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
They'd notice, they'd notice
Let me lay you down, down, down
Tryna lay you down, down, down
You still the baddest girl around, 'round, 'round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it"

Maybe today will be the day that we fix things
Maybe today will be the day that I fall apart
But I'm having a hard time time keeping track of all
The bad news that I take in on the regular
I wish that I could just change the way things are

[Chorus]:
Sometimes it if feels like No one's Alright
Wish I could make you make you feel
Like you're close to something real
I've been staying up all night
Wishing I could make the world right
Wish I could make you make you feel
Like you're close to something real
I've been staying up all night
Wishing I could make the world right

[Verse 2]:
Wishin' wishin', thinking
What if I fall will I give up it all
Will I be there to answer my call
When sippin' sippin' got me sinkin'
Tippin' that bottle, back's to the wall though
Nothing can stop me at all
Like every choice I'm making I've been fluctuating in and out of different mind states
Am I the only motherfucker one headline away from going calm to irate
Make sense, we complacent in all that we're faced with when coming up out of this climate
My take, we're tired of living off blind faith, redefine great and ride that line straight

Cause you know, sometimes it feeling like it may never end
But we both gotta be looking at it through a different lens
To see through what's polluting our vision
Keep moving forward I can promise you that I got your back it ain't nothing new yeah

[Chorus]:
Sometimes it if feels like No one's Alright
Wish I could make you make you feel
Like you're close to something real
I've been staying up all night
Wishing I could make the world right
Wish I could make you make you feel
Like you're close to something real
I've been staying up all night
Wishing I could make the world right

[Verse 3]:
If ya feel unknown know you're not alone yeah we all in this fight
Think you can't move on from the wrong you've done we can always make it right
You are far from a lost cause
We'll keep on pushing against all odds
If ya feeling clouded with shame and succumb to your dismay
Y'all better believe me when I say that it don't have to be that way

I've been there too looking to escape out
Putting faith in hollow heroes thinking there's no way out
Got me stuck, an endless cycle of pain and of self doubt
Grab my hand take a plunge and maybe we can breakout

Got me stuck up in a cycle of pain and self doubt
Got me stuck, in an constant cycle of pain and self doubt"

I'm someone who has a lot of sex
That's why they call me sex haver
Yeah, I love sex a lot which is
Why they also call me sex lover
People in the streets go up to me and say
Yo, sex haver, how are you
I tell them I'm good, having a lot of sex
Cuz that's what a sex haver's got to do

(Unknown)
I love Doctor Penez!

[Pre-Chorus]
I have so much sex which is why they call me the sex haver
It's less a funny name and more of the truth

[Chorus]
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
[Post-Chorus]
This is basic sex haver knowledge which is why
I know it because I'm a sex haver

[Verse 2]
From the womb to the women I spoon
All they know is I've been having lots of sex
From the east to the west I've been having so much sex
But I'm still nowhere near the best
But they still know I have a lot of sex
Maybe that's just what counts
Maybe I'm stupid or maybe I'm smart
But I like my dicky in her pinky and my pinkie where she farts

[Chorus]
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex
I'm a sex haver, it means I have lots of sex

I bet when I die, it'll be because I had too much sex in a day
The most times I've had sex in a day was twenty-three

I'm a sex haver which means that I have sex with
Just what I have which is why I'm called sex haver
I only have sex with women and girls only

I'm not homophobic either, but I'm just not gay"
8247,"Verse 1:
Oh girl, I been lookin at your Instagram
Wondering if I could get a dance
I don’t want no strings attached, just a man who’s looking for someone to bring that back
Oh girl, honesty’s embedded in the plan, I promise if you give a man a chance
I’ll show you how to live this life, I’m not looking for forever I just want one night, Oh girl
Say the word and I’ll be on the way. I know that you been struggling through the day
Oh, oh, oh I can ease your mind. I been busy moving on the road. So why don’t we just intertwine our souls. Baby just call my name and I’ll do the same, lets break the rules

Hook 1:
I hope you feel the same about me, causе I don’t wanna love you, love you, I just want One Night x2

Vеrse 2:
All these feelings got me feeling like a hypocrite. I was searching for the one but now I’m living it
And now I’m giving it, situation is riveting, splitting legs is the business, while paying out the divide-he-ends. I don’t know your name. I know that’s a shame and it’s my fault, but love was designed for, every single person but me
So, I’m saying hey lil mama, ooh you a stunna, will you let me buy you a drink?
Cause play’s what I came for, days seem to get short, time is of the essence for me
So I’m saying aye lil mama, vibe of the summer, sun is shining bright will you be? My pretty little angel, all you do is say so, time is running out so don’t think

Hook 2:
I hope you feel the same about me, cause I don’t wanna love you, love you, I just want One Night x2
Verse 3 Cham Ba:
I don’t want a forever, just want a night to remember
Candle lights in the center, damn I’m liking your denim
The way its wrapped around your thighs so wide you look like you struggle every morning just to get in em
I don’t need another half, you can keep the percentage, I need the night to last til we both got to exit. Don’t wanna be a confidant baby hold the confessions I just wanna be the past, no future or present tense and
Apologies I don’t mean to be so foul, I’m from White Center baby where the freaks come out, where the G’s in route from West side to South, If you ain’t know you betta know by now
What’s more rude, honesty about a one night stand or me lying saying that I wanna be your man?
I promise no complications, I promise time won’t be wasted, or any hearts will be aching, I promise no promise breaking
And it’s koo if you want a lifetime with a husband, I just wanna spend every hour of everyday loving, I don’t wanna be another ex added to the pile, I wanna be the night you can't remember without a smile, and…

Hook 3
I hope you feel the same about me, cause I don’t wanna love you, love you, I just want One Night x4"

I feel like fucking up the game within a millisecond
Life is a bitch, I can't wait to put my dick in that shit
Rapper come at me I will smack and attack with a hatched
You're just a sucker, I'm a baller, call me mister hat trick
I got your sister pregnant
She fucked with this song, you gotta give me credit
I'm still in development, spend, left-handed, a rap addict
This shit is cinematic, berserk, send in a medic
Rapper acting dramatic, DL, we innovate
Crime rhyme might get arrested
But I'm not interested because I break bars
With papers you may saw it, this is magic

This is magic, this is magic

Nah, stick in my middle finger faggot
Hopeless romantic, Titanic, it's time to panic, I get it

And make you jump like a rabbit
Better go down like your status
Bad as the baddest I bet ya
But better than half of these rappers

Better than half of these rappers?
Acting like they sending a message?
I'm back on passing backwoods in the back of a minivan
That ass don’t fit in the van
And that shit is magic
We working till the break till of dawn
Paint the picture
Pay attention
Now ain't it funny they ain't staying with ye
But came back with sorry
Still, l make the same decisions
Still the same all along
And still, I stayed ambitious
Well, got my mind on ease, future in progress
Inside of me it's dark, you didn't notice?
I guess my life will be hide and seek with my emotions
Light the trees silently, sipping poison
I believe I achieve whatever lies in front of me
Finally, I will be exactly what I'm here for
I got dreams and fight for these till they becoming assets
I will see what happens. But this shit fucking magic

Everyday is just another day
Every morning hoping I wake up again
Time is money and I'm running late
Pray to God that someone understands
Oh God, thinking bout way back
Thinking oh shit
Still on that same shit, no co-sign
Hold up, what is love and what’s faith?
Where's the trust in our people?
Understand that I'm rapping for the sake of my freedom
And may we all be equal
May we all be equal
Maybe it's just a dream
I let Satan be the reason
But maybe it's not easy like we’re looking for the meaning
And what is an opinion if no single person hears it
Don't let your mind be imprisoned by the things that you're fearing
Cuz this is DL every single piece a classic, baby this is magic

Don't you get it?
It's a habit I have since I have this mic
Had to fight for it, before it, before it cracked or it went up in flames
I can't ignore it, just never record with candle light
LED, get it right, and don't bug me, parasite
Infectious, I will leave you paralyzed
On my way to studio like I'm going to paradise
You rappers lie, period
Can't handle criteria
Better dig me, if you don't I might bury you
Put fear in you, ice cold, Siberia
Not into you, will end ya, a ninja, so better know I'm hearing you
Offend you, adventure, a ranger, a danger, to who ever is a faker
Imma rape and I might get arrested, but I'm not interested
Because I break bars with papers you may saw it this is magic

Tell me something i dont know
Ima tell you something that you know but ignore
This is life here n its rough
You let them closer then you better be ready to spas..
Is you the one i sed
""Dont be a slave bro!, Better look out for plain clothes""
I took out ma name out the levels of mehn yooh
Coz thEy kill you for mere hoes

All that decency dont mean a thing you can make it public n i promise you nobody cares
The longer you patient
The stronger yoh break is
The more you repel
Its all that it takes

Back in ma hood i see power corrupt n these cowards are stupid to pull out a gun
I dont know trap i know fact you're a crack in e head
Lookin at fortune in hell
This what you call amageddon the young are killing young niccurs n dont give a $hit!
You dont know nuthin 'bout winning you play with yoh soul but the game you adore is a pit
Pull up the flag n ma niccurs are back with the fire
Bullets spread along wen ey pass
Song on ma radio sound like the many on play are couple 'babies no task


(Chorus)
Right hand on my Bible
I dont want nuthin with idols
Came in the i survive folks
Ats e difinition of  tight rope

Say a prayer for the ones who die for it;
Same wit the ones
Who forget the far we came n lie for it;
I get to reason
When thats all n i want more x2

Tell me something i dont know
I'ma show you something that you know but ignore
This is life n i dont rush
Thanks am bout to flip a coin n be done in a month

We dont like to get rough
I dont like to talk much
Lead on ma zeroes
Till everybody know me as a map
I dont see heroes wen niccurs
Put dead bodies out in e coold
The kid hu'never had a chance
They kidding and nobody cared to respond the alarm
They found demons in a city where lost angels salt n vinegar blood
Flow crushin down ma enemy yard
Low pressure when i parachute up
No hand on money may you live n see my chain big as a dinosaur skull..

Look at ma past n i mirror yoh fate..
Door behind me you dont pick on a date..
So many gears runnin a race...
That saw me climbin to the tip of the cake..
Almost divin at the deep of the lake..
Trip on ma laces n save me the day..
You can be a hero but nobody pays..
Told ma pple let the system behave..

Leave us alone n be done with yoh race..
Give you my word n its only began..
You gat the world n it dont mean a thing..
Vanity vanity you understand
And a listener told me dont be what they want..
Shoot with the highest target when you want..
Beef with the meanest lion where am from and
Its not connected with the margin i roam

I love Him above all things
He brings joy to my heart till it's overflowing
I love Him above all things
He keeps guiding my way teaching me not to stray
When trouble comes He delivers me every time, gives me peace of mind
But they're not the main reasons why

I love Him (I love Him) I love Him (I love Him)
Because He first loved me
I love Him (I love Him) I love Him (I love Him)
Because He first loved me and purchased my salvation on Calvary
So I'm gonna praise Him, worship Him, exalt Him above all things
So I'm gonna love Him, serve Him, exalt Him above all things

I love Him above all things
He corrects, He forgives, what is hidden He reveals
I love Him above all things
He gives gladness for tears, He gives strength, never fears
Though enemies may surround me He holds my hand, He understands
But they're not the main reasons why
I love Him (I love Him) I love Him (I love Him)

Sure to see your name in lights
Star-crossed by the sick-sweet glamor
Fool's gold paves paradise

Now you come crawlin' home
Guess you figured I'd be waiting
Never leave your lover all alone

It's just the way that it goes
You knew it
You left your lover alone
Why'd you do it

Vampires and wise old vultures
(Make) quick work of the trusting kind
Colder shoulders than a merciless mother
Took you down and then they bled you dry

Now you come crawlin' home

Never leave your lover all alone"

It's Tyreise Kymani
And I'm just speaking on some of my thoughts about everything that's going on right now
Listen

[Verse 1]
On this one I'm going deep
Man I think its time that I spoke my emotions
On this one I wanna speak
Of all those things that remain unspoken
Like
Things are so broken
We lost our way In a state of commotion
But I'm just wondering
When all our eyes will finally open
With All the stuff that's happening now
Yeah man I know it's all crazy
Don't mind me when I say this but
Not gonna lie
It's all kinda shady
We could all think what we want
You may not agree and I understand but
It seems to me
This whole virus thing is all part of a bigger plan
This system is run by fear
Try tell me I'm wrong when it's clear to see that
When you're scared you're more prone to listen
And be controlled like a Hurd of sheep and
I can't believe that we choose to sleep
And it all repeats man it hurts to see that
The way we live like we're in a cell
Yet we still don't know
Take some time to deep that
Speaking facts when I'm spitting rap
Our generation's at risk an that
But that Gucci scarf and that Gucci hat and that Gucci belt
It won't fix all that
FTS man It's fuck the system!
Staying woke is my only mission
17 spitting nothing but facts
And you know I'm right but you still won't listen
[Verse 2]
Yo most of you know who I am but
It's Tyreise Kymani aka Reckoning
I gave myself that name
To show the world I speak the truth
With no editing
I say shit how it is
That's why you know
They might see me as threatening
But I don't care bro
Fuck the system
I'm speaking my truth
Yo here comes reckoning
If they claim they care bout us
Tell me why there's still people on the street
Tell me why I can't get no answers
To none of the flipping questions I seek
Yo tell me why
If you dont have money, then
Your not valued as one of the peeps
This situation brings irritation and agrivation yet still we all sleep

[Verse 3]
He said I can't breath
Still you were suffocating him with your knee
Man this is aggravating I can't believe
This is all still going
George rest in peace
Yeah we have it here in the uk too
People forget racism ain't new
Cuz it's been going for hundreds of years
But still no justice has ever come through
Listen
This happened on august 4th
In the evening in 2011
Mark Duggan
He was in a taxi and feds pulled him up
So he walked to the pavement
Man it makes me vexed
And it boils my blood cuz you know da racism its blatant
They went and shot him twice
Just like that a innocent mans life was taken
It's cuz he was black
They framed him
Said he was armed with a strap
Steven Lawrence
Smiley culture
More black men that were killed cuz this crap
We need to wake up
I want justice for all of my people we must unite
I want justice
We should be equal
I will always stand for all my rights
Listen...

Yeah

Going down on this girl, might as well be in Hell. So much blood
Talk about time-of-the-month: it's like time-of-the-year
It's got all stored up in here like it was waiting for me to appear
Man, I wish I'd had a beer or two or ten
Been a little bit drunk when
I decided to eat her out cause now, I won't be eating for a while
But that's sex, right? Giving and taking
And that's alright as long as the bitch is tight
Cause I be telling you like every waking moment
Minute of a relationship I been in
And the girl don't do shit but complaining. And I'm forsaking this
As soon as I get my tongue outta here quick
My head is spinning; I can't do this. Come up for air
She grabs my hair, pushes me down. Feeling rather sick now
Don't know how I'm supposed to do this shit
Oh, wow [vomit noises]
Threw up in her vagina: bits of chicken and rice-a
Man, girl, I'm sorry: I probably shouldn't have had that curry
And it didn't help that your minge tasted of a gone-off bhaji
Whoops, but I like
Really like to to give her a fuck; now it's her problem
I wipe my mouth and go back down
Hear her screams from above, plow through the noise
Of my lapping lips against my sick; she can't handle this
Fuck that bitch: I shove that sick into her vagina
Later she can take her pick to shower or bath-a
But it won't come out of her. Yes, I'm that sick
I hate this bitch. She's crying out, pleading me to stop
And knock her out then shove my cock
Into every orifice like an orthodontist beating an anthropologist
Sucking the dick of a radiologist
Who's obsessed with fucking cunts or smoking blunts
And eating mad meat chunks. Men can't be monks
They got too much obsession with pussy
Get girls gushy, so please don't push me
I got too crunk before I fucked this one
Ah yeah, don't care if my penis is pusy
You're still gonna lick it, hun; get that chunk
Before I shank, shank, shank your mum; fuck you in the bum
Till I cum, cum, cum. Then make you choke on it
And you bet I'll be smoking it while she be taking
Tokes on this dick; you best believe it
Cause this bitch is sick: she be covered in it
[Verse 2: The Etherealist]
Oh shit, I just puréed a nurse
Hit her with a stolen hearse while I was writing this verse
Now I've got a thirst for that vagina of hers
So I'mma stick her till I squirt before she's six foot in dirt
HOV: don't think we won't go there
I got parts of every one of my teachers way back to daycare
Almost got enough now to make my own Frankenstein
Reanimate mine just so I can fuck it in its stankin' eye
I draw from every killer in the history book
Battered with spades, eating your brain for that Ian Brady look
Or maybe I'll go Albert Fish up in this bitch
Cook and eat your kid, then in a letter, detail it
I should be locked up, man. I'm sick: I'm fucking crazy
Mutilate your baby, maybe bake it with some gravy
History of Violence is really just a plan
So I can get close to In2ition and slice him up like ham

[Verse 3: In2ition]
Ether thinks he can play me? Let him fucking try
He's gonna eat someone's baby? I'll eat his fucking eyes
But he won't even face me, let alone phase me
And that's the same for everyone these days, see?
Judgmental pricks listen to my lyrics and have no words for me
Their Lady GaGa speeches even though they're fucking freaks
Their opinion of my music is that 'it's fucking weak'
Makes their heart repeat, think it's bleak, seem to tell me it's weak
Weak cause it's disgusting and weak cause it's against
Every single thing they've ever been brought up to hate
Well I'm done with these false fucking fake saints
And their childish impudence. I'll kidnap their children and make them impotent
Fuck 'em so hard when they're ten, they'll never be able to get it up again
And then if these haters still hate on me
I'll turn up at their house, quiet as a mouse
With a surprise for them from me: my erected blood-doused cock
I'll bash their head in with a wok while they're listening to rock Which is their favourite type of music cause they're fucking stupid
The type of person who believes in Cupid
I'll rape their dying body; don't dare try to stop me
Don't try to cock-block me
I'm trying to fucking kill you, bitch: get your fucking hairy hands off of me
Break her arms off just in time to cum up inside of her body
And then I rest, laying on the floor next to her barely beating chest
I'm impressed: that was my best ever birthday sex
And I've been blessed, so let's just suggest
You people learn from this. Don't protest
Just caress yourself nice and slow when you listen to me, ho
So then I won't rape-kill ya, yo!"

7109,"To the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery. Thank Heaven, here is not all the world. The buckeye does not grow in New England, and the mockingbird is rarely heard here. The wild goose is more of a cosmopolite than we; he breaks his fast in Canada, takes a luncheon in the Ohio, and plumes himself for the night in a southern bayou. Even the bison, to some extent, keeps pace with the seasons cropping the pastures of the Colorado only till a greener and sweeter grass awaits him by the Yellowstone. Yet we think that if rail fences are pulled down, and stone walls piled up on our farms, bounds are henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If you are chosen town clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer: but you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe is wider than our views of it.

Yet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious passengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum. The other side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent. Our voyaging is only great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin merely. One hastens to southern Africa to chase the giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How long, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to shoot one's self.—

""Direct your eye right inward, and you'll find
A thousand regions in your mind
Yet undiscovered. Travel them, and be
Expert in home-cosmography.""

What does Africa -- what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior white on the chart? black though it may prove, like the coast, when discovered. Is it the source of the Nile, or the Niger, or the Mississippi, or a Northwest Passage around this continent, that we would find? Are these the problems which most concern mankind? Is Franklin the only man who is lost, that his wife should be so earnest to find him? Does Mr. Grinnell know where he himself is? Be rather the Mungo Park, the Lewis and Clark and Frobisher, of your own streams and oceans; explore your own higher latitudes -- with shiploads of preserved meats to support you, if they be necessary; and pile the empty cans sky-high for a sign. Were preserved meats invented to preserve meat merely? Nay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a petty state, a hummock left by the ice. Yet some can be patriotic who have no self-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea Exploring Expedition, with all its parade and expense, but an indirect recognition of the fact that there are continents and seas in the moral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet unexplored by him, but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals, in a government ship, with five hundred men and boys to assist one, than it is to explore the private sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one's being alone.

""Erret, et extremos alter scrutetur Iberos.
Plus habet hic vitae, plus habet ille viae.""

Let them wander and scrutinize the outlandish Australians. I have more of God, they more of the road.

It is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in Zanzibar. Yet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps find some ""Symmes' Hole"" by which to get at the inside at last. England and France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front on this private sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of land, though it is without doubt the direct way to India. If you would learn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all nations, if you would travel farther than all travellers, be naturalized in all climes, and cause the Sphinx to dash her head against a stone, even obey the precept of the old philosopher, and Explore thyself. Herein are demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the defeated and deserters go to the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on that farthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the Pacific, nor conduct toward a wornout China or Japan, but leads on direct, a tangent to this sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun down, moon down, and at last earth down too.

It is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery ""to ascertain what degree of resolution was necessary in order to place one's self in formal opposition to the most sacred laws of society."" He declared that ""a soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much courage as a footpad"" -- ""that honor and religion have never stood in the way of a well-considered and a firm resolve."" This was manly, as the world goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man would have found himself often enough ""in formal opposition"" to what are deemed ""the most sacred laws of society,"" through obedience to yet more sacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without going out of his way. It is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to society, but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself through obedience to the laws of his being, which will never be one of opposition to a just government, if he should chance to meet with such.

I left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it seemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare any more time for that one. It is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves. I had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my door to the pond-side; and though it is five or six years since I trod it, it is still quite distinct. It is true, I fear, that others may have fallen into it, and so help ed to keep it open. The surface of the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which the mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the world, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to take a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world, for there I could best see the moonlight amid the mountains. I do not wish to go below now.
I learned this, at least, by my experiment: that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and solitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness weakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.

It is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you shall speak so that they can understand you. Neither men nor toadstools grow so. As if that were important, and there were not enough to understand you without them. As if Nature could support but one order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as quadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and hush and whoa, which Bright can understand, were the best English. As if there were safety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not be extravagant enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow limits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of which I have been convinced. Extra vagance! it depends on how you are yarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another latitude, is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail, leaps the cowyard fence, and runs after her calf, in milking time. I desire to speak somewhere without bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he should speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future or possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our outlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an insensible perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly translated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures.

Why level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as common sense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which they express by snoring. Sometimes we are inclined to class those who are once-and-a-half-witted with the half-witted, because we appreciate only a third part of their wit. Some would find fault with the morning red, if they ever got up early enough. ""They pretend,"" as I hear, ""that the verses of Kabir have four different senses; illusion, spirit, intellect, and the exoteric doctrine of the Vedas""; but in this part of the world it is considered a ground for complaint if a man's writings admit of more than one interpretation. While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally?

I do not suppose that I have attained to obscurity, but I should be proud if no more fatal fault were found with my pages on this score than was found with the Walden ice. Southern customers objected to its blue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as if it were muddy, and preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds. The purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth, and not like the azure ether beyond.

Some are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally, are intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients, or even the Elizabethan men. But what is that to the purpose? A living dog is better than a dead lion. Shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy that he can? Let every one mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he was made.

Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple tree or an oak. Shall he turn his spring into summer? If the condition of things which we were made for is not yet, what were any reality which we can substitute? We will not be shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we with pains erect a heaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done we shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the former were not?

There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having considered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a perfect work time does not enter, he said to himself, It shall be perfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else in my life. He proceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it should not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and rejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for they grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a moment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated piety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he made no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed at a distance because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a stock in all respects suitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and with the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in the sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and polished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere he had put on the ferule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma had awoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to mention these things? When the finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly expanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations of Brahma. He had made a new system in making a staff, a world with full and fair proportions; in which, though the old cities and dynasties had passed away, fairer and more glorious ones had taken their places. And now he saw by the heap of shavings still fresh at his feet, that, for him and his work, the former lapse of time had been an illusion, and that no more time had elapsed than is required for a single scintillation from the brain of Brahma to fall on and inflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The material was pure, and his art was pure; how could the result be other than wonderful?

No face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where we are, but in a false position. Through an infinity of our natures, we suppose a case, and put ourselves into it, and hence are in two cases at the same time, and it is doubly difficult to get out. In sane moments we regard only the facts, the case that is. Say what you have to say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe. Tom Hyde, the tinker, standing on the gallows, was asked if he had anything to say. ""Tell the tailors,"" said he, ""to remember to make a knot in their thread before they take the first stitch."" His companion's prayer is forgotten.

However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. Maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: ""From an army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought."" Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and meanness gather around us, ""and lo! creation widens to our view."" We are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Croesus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.

I live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured a little alloy of bell-metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there reaches my ears a confused tintinnabulum from without. It is the noise of my contemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they met at the dinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in the contents of the Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are about costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress it as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of England and the Indies, of the Hon. Mr. --- of Georgia or of Massachusetts, all transient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap from their court-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my bearings -- not walk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but to walk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may -- not to live in this restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand or sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They are all on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from somebody. God is only the president of the day, and Webster is his orator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully attracts me -- not hang by the beam of the scale and try to weigh less -- not suppose a case, but take the case that is; to travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist me. It affords me no satisfaction to commerce to spring an arch before I have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There is a solid bottom everywhere. We read that the traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that it had. But presently the traveller's horse sank in up to the girths, and he observed to the boy, ""I thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom."" ""So it has,"" answered the latter, ""but you have not got half way to it yet."" So it is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but he is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said, or done at a certain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the furring. Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work with satisfaction -- a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.

Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious attendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry from the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the ices. I thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They talked to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I thought of an older, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious vintage, which they had not got, and could not buy. The style, the house and grounds and ""entertainment"" pass for nothing with me. I called on the king, but he made me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man incapacitated for hospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow tree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I called on him.

How long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty virtues, which any work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin the day with long-suffering, and hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in the afternoon go forth to practise Christian meekness and charity with goodness aforethought! Consider the China pride and stagnant self-complacency of mankind. This generation inclines a little to congratulate itself on being the last of an illustrious line; and in Boston and London and Paris and Rome, thinking of its long descent, it speaks of its progress in art and science and literature with satisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and the public Eulogies of Great Men! It is the good Adam contemplating his own virtue. ""Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs, which shall never die"" -- that is, as long as we can remember them. The learned societies and great men of Assyria -- where are they? What youthful philosophers and experimentalists we are! There is not one of my readers who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be but the spring months in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years' itch, we have not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep nearly half our time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise, and have an established order on the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we are ambitious spirits! As I stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest floor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself why it will cherish those humble thoughts, and bide its head from me who might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some cheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and Intelligence that stands over me the human insect.

There is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we tolerate incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened to in the most enlightened countries. There are such words as joy and sorrow, but they are only the burden of a psalm, sung with a nasal twang, while we believe in the ordinary and mean. We think that we can change our clothes only. It is said that the British Empire is very large and respectable, and that the United States are a first-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he should ever harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year locust will next come out of the ground? The government of the world I live in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner conversations over the wine.
The life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year higher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even this may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats. It was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its freshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of New England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer's kitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in Massachusetts -- from an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it; which was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the heat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb -- heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board -- may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society's most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!

I do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.

I've got to go, let me go find
Savior in the sound
[Verse 2]
With all these open wounds still I know
I will find my strength, get up on my own
Put out the fire watch it fade, fade into smoke
Watch the lava turn to stone

[Pre-Chorus]
Beg and pray my feet don't give up
Beg my ears, don't fail me now
Only the sound, only the sound of music
Can save me now

[Chorus]
Why can't I cool it down
Out of control, system overload
Pushing all my limits
I can't try to stop it
Not even your pills
Can change the way I feel
I've got to go, let me go find
Savior in the sound

[Bridge]
I won’t fight, I won’t push
I won’t kick and scream
Head up high, hold on tight
Wake up from this dream
Open eyes and open heart
I gotta follow, I’ll follow, I’ll follow the sound, oh, but why
[Outro]
Tell me why, why
I've got to go, let me go find
Savior in the sound"
5993,"[Verse 1]
He likes liquor and cocaine
I like playing with his brain
Or maybe I’m just vain
I like looking at the stars
He likes playing with my heart
He knows just when to start
And I don’t tell him to stop

[Chorus]
I don’t tell him to stop x7

[Verse 2]
He likes the way I walked in
I might just say that I popped in
Ya maybe this is fate
Boy could you cooperate
Do you want me cause you hate her
I’m just tryna see you later
I’m just tryna see you later
[Pre-Chorus]
You know just when to start
You know just when to start
When to start
But I don’t tell him to stop

[Chorus]
I don't tell him to stop x12

[Verse 3]
Don’t wanna talk
You wanna walk
Don’t wanna see my way
You want me here you want me there
You want me everywhere
Ooo the way you say my name
You just make me go insane
Oo I knew when I first met you
They got the best of me
But I won’t let you
This time I won’t let him too far

[Chorus]
I don't tell him to stop x8"
7893,"Paint me in the colours of the sun
Let me feel the bliss in your smile
I've been down for so long
I'm waiting you, needing you, hating you
There's nothing to do
I'm worshipping you. I'm longing to feel you

Paint me. Paint out home
Paint in the colours you choose
Nothing would please me more
The curtains you pick are the fools
It's strange and it's filled with you

Just maybe we're closing in
Maybe we'll break it again
I'm wanting you, needing you, hating you, loosing you
I'm worshipping you. I'm longing to feel you

Paint me. Paint out home
Paint in the colours you choose
Nothing would please me more

If this love was really strong
I'd want her now, the way I did last night
But deep inside me I'm just dealin'
With the same old guilty feelin'
'Cause things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light

Somewhere a lonely clock strikes four
I'll sneak up and out the door
She'll pretend that she's asleep
Till I'm out of sight
I'll go home, an' I'll sneak in
Tell a lie about where I've been
'Cause things sure do look different
In the cold, cold morning light

That's what makes it all so lonely

Is that even when I'm home
I know I'll see her again, tomorrow night
Thrill cheats, until we've had our fill
Call it love until
We see it for what it is
In the cold, cold morning light
Somewhere a lonely clock strikes four
I'll sneak up and out the door
She'll pretend that she's asleep
Till I'm out of sight
Then I'll go home, I'll sneak in
Tell lies 'bout where I've been

Smell of tobacco

Where were you then?

[Twin] Ayo P what's good dunn! What's happening?

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo what up with it, yeah it's been a minute
I'm good on this side of the fence, same shit
Different spot on the navigation, just being patient
Working out, reading and writing you know the basics
Corrections, got word from Albany
Keep me in voluntary P.C, which means
The state decides where I live
Can't sign out because I never signed in
Difference between they bid and my bid is
This ain't county jail, this is state prison
I'm high risk, high profile too
There ain't population but niggas like ""Who you?""
Never heard of you, keep banging do your thang and
Maybe one day you'll be famous, but fuck all that
They got this phone tapped you hear me G's?
Tell Tyson bring that beef and broccoli on the next VI
Ayo what's up with Hav?

There gonna be drastic changes when i get back
It gonna be me and [?] on the [?] like [?] said
[Hook]
Ayo they monitor the phone calls, watch what you say
They got the phones tapped better watch how you speak
Yeah, welcome to state prison
They got a call on the hotline who is it?

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I heard Rap D got knocked, I mean Max B

Tell Un every lights green ain't no passes

For their jewelry and things
Give my love to the Zoo baby, Village Boo
Maniac, Tip-Toe and Badass too
Anyway, 50 came in to see me last weekend
We had a long talk about how it's gonna be when
I touch town, and when I touch down
We're gonna party like the SuperBowl on the countdown
Without a fuck left, this shit is nothing
Nigga, Ferg about to come home from doing real numbers
15 years on lock, he was wilding they sent him to 200 box
So Twin listen, holla at Gotti and Ron Ron
Tell him congratulations, he made it to the Lakers
And we gonna get this money like it grow on trees
And anybody hating, nigga taste on these
Godzilla balls, I talk fire when I speak these lyrics
The rap game twisted, because everybody copy what the next man does
I listen to Pitbull and Flo Rida
These new niggas sounding like Kanye West
He's a biter not a writer, I'm not impressed
You a lover not a fighter so cut the bullshit
All they're gonna do is run like Saigon did
But tell Hav I love him get the beats together
So when Mobb Deep drop we be bigger and better
Word, tell him I need fire nigga
So when Mobb Deep drop we be bigger and better

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Ayo I just got a letter from the real Rick Ross
He in the feds right now but he's real short
What else? Cormega came through on the humble
We had a good visit (that's my dunn)
Yeah that's my dunn too
He told me that Nas still tight
Because I rep Queensbridge harder than a lead pipe
And I'm from Hempstead, close to the shacks on Park side
Guess he mad I'm successful, and he can't shine
Oh that's too bad, Oh that's so sad
He remembers Central Park, he better fall back
Let me chill because I'm talking reckless on this jack
And police is listening, to everything said
What up with your brothers Punk Munk and Alley Moe?
That's good, tell Moms I said Hello
And I know I'm talking your head off, but we ain't speak
In a few months, been so much that's happening
Like Michael Jackson died, the fans is bugging
Now Jay-Z's summer jam picture means nothing
Oh yeah, I was with [?]
We was in Rikers Island, the CO's was wilding
The female officers was bad as hell
If I had've stayed a little longer I'd have got some tail
See, Alchemist on tour with Slim Shady
Home girl better chill before Em let that tape leak
Before Cam'Ron let that tape leak
Before Ma$e let that tape leak, damn she a freak
I spoke to Yayo last night he just copped
The new four door Porsche (Yeah that shit hot!)
I know, but I'm back on my Acura shit
No jewelry with the factory rims
That life he living now I already lived
It's his turn to shine it's my turn to sit
Back like a Mac and let the bread stack
Yo Cocaine I still wanna test drive that!
Yeah YG wrote me, he holding it down
And Nut wrote a book he a author now
Tell Bumpy George and Tim Law what's up
Props Karate Joe, Black Ice all my dunns, you heard?

They caught him in Utica with guns in the car
Damn, we just chilling on the DI floor
Heard Money Know getting in it, that's my G
Tell him to stay low, and stay sucker free
JM will be home real soon before me
And my nigga Shameek back on the concrete, now
Roam just got bagged for crazy powder
Man New York hotter than hellfire keep outta
The reach of the Police, stay off the streets
They locking niggas up like slavery
I just got a kite from Shee I leech
And LL suppose to come up so we can speak

Good because I got certain shit I can't say on this phone

It's a holiday I'll celebrate with my own company
Pour the wine, I'll be fine
Climb the ladder and place the star
Well, Merry Christmas wherever in the world you are

I won't have to deal with your family
The dressing and the stress, dysfunctionality
A two day drive, stuck inside with you signing in my car
Well, Merry Christmas wherever in the world you are

Don't have to rack my brain tryin' to find you the right thing you won't like anyway
Avoid your flirtin' brother and please your mother or find the right thing to say

I'll hold the remote control on Christmas Day
And I can watch The Grinch and not some football game
I'll order in, call some friends, might smoke me a cigar
Well, Merry Christmas wherever in the world you are

Don't have to rack my brain, tryin' to find you the right thing you won't like anyway
Avoid your flirtin' brother and please your mother or find the right thing to say
I won't have to wait for that ring this year
The one you always promised after too many beers
Pour the wine, I'll be fine
Climb the ladder and place the star
Well, Merry Christmas wherever in the world

Merry Christmas wherever in the world
Merry Christmas wherever in the hell you are"
2089,"INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40’s), shabby suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He FIDDLES with his last two chips.

COBB (O.S.): Rub them against each other all you like, they’re not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

EAMES: You never know.

Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

COBB: Drink?

Eames loses.

EAMES: You’re buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

COBB: You’re spelling hasn’t improved.
Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

EAMES: Piss off.

COBB: How’s your handwriting?

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

EAMES: Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.

EAMES: Word is, you’re not welcome in these parts.

COBB: Yeah?

EAMES: There’s a price on your head from Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one, actually.

COBB: You wouldn’t sell me out.

Eames looks at Cobb, offended.

EAMES: ‘Course I would.
COBB (smiles): Not when you hear what I’m selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

COBB: Inception.

Eames’s glass stops halfway to his mouth.

COBB: Don’t bother telling me it’s impossible.

EAMES: It’s perfectly possible. Just bloody difficult.

COBB: That’s what I keep saying to Arthur.

EAMES: Arthur? You’re still working with that stick-in-the-mud?

COBB: He’s a good point man.

EAMES: The best. But he has no imagination. If you’re going to perform inception, you need imagination.

COBB: You’ve done it before?

EAMES: Yes and no. We tried it. Got the idea in place, but it didn’t take.
COBB: You didn’t plant it deep enough?

EAMES: It’s not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind. Subtle art.

COBB: That’s why I’m here.

EAMES: What’s the idea you need to plant?

COBB: We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father’s empire.

EAMES: See, right there you’ve got various political motivations, anti-monopolistic sentiment and so forth. But all that stuff’s at the mercy of the subject’s prejudice- you have to go to the basic.

COBB: Which is?

EAMES: The relationship with the father. (downs drink) Do you have a chemist?

Cobb shakes his head.

EAMES: There’s a man here. Yusuf. He formulates his own versions of the compounds.

COBB: Let’s go see him.

EAMES: Once you’ve lost your tail. (Cobb reacts) Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in about two minutes after we did.

COBB: Cobol Engineering?

EAMES: They pretty much own Mombasa.

Cobb glances over the balcony.

COBB: Run interference. We’ll meet downstairs in half an hour.

EAMES: Back here?

COBB: Last place they’d expect.

Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

EAMES: Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

EAMES: Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into the midst of the crowd on the street below.

EAMES (looks harder): Oh. No, it isn’t.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is there.

COBB (disarming smile): Yes?

SECOND BUSINESSMAN: We need to-

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake, DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables... the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS DRAWN-
Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end- he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight. Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP, BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

SAITO: Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

COBB (jumping in): What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito?

SAITO: I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

EAMES: This is your idea of losing a tail?

COBB (shrugs): Different tail."

Fooling  you was easy

The story just came alive

Blue eyed sure believed me

Trickle,  u go, now dive



Ravenous,  bored

White knight, oh lord

Couldn’t  resist flesh so needy

Fooling you was easy
Mmmm



I’ve got bad intentions

(But)  Look like a doll

I’ve got bad intentions

(And) That’s when you fall



Right into me

Down on you knee

Asking me why I’ve got big teeth

Shut up my dear

I can smell fear


Are you looking for a friend

To rip out your heart

I can paint blood art

Cuz ur starring at the end

Rippn’ off my bra

Getting what I want

You should know better better

Things getting badder badder

But you don’t you don’t



Loving me is dreamy

A bad one stuck on repeat

Obey me completely
Perfect collapse so sweet



Lost in the woods

Poor riding hood

Help soon a heart might be broken

Loving me bad dreamy

I’ve got bad intentions

Smile to attack

I’ve got bad intentions

Always come back



Right into me

Asking me why I’ve got big teeth

Shut up my dear

4900,"[Verse 1]
You'll see that it's your chance
The people come here and everything restarts
In the middle of the sounds of the city
You arrived all timidly
Lost in the scenery
Heart in the air and eyes that devour
All the tastes of the city
That called you between their lines

[Verse 2]
Solid and pitiless
The passersby gather in their paths
Setting forth like a river
In a hurry to catch up with their heart

[Chorus]
You start off and with a leap
You mix into the crowd
That carries you off randomly
Like a feather in the middle of a blizzard
So far that for a second you start to panic
You feel your feet leave the ground
And your mind which takes flight
[Verse 3]
Alone
At daybreak
Like a sailor on a beach
Washed ashore by a wave
We had found you
Your little body still stiff
But washed of all innocence
Ready to return to the dance

[Verse 4]
You hear the avalanche
Of an army of busy souls setting off
Making your whole body vibrate
Let's hope this time you'll get out there

[Chorus]
You start off and with a leap
You mix into the crowd
That carry you off at random
Like a feather in the middle of a blizzard
So far that for a second you start to panic
You feel your feet leave the ground
And your mind which takes flight

[Verse 5: Yelle]
Everything goes so fast around your body
The noise of the colors
Everything blends and your heart lifts itself up again
When your eyes close
In this maze with nowhere to hide
You're like a tadpole
Lost in the beautiful center of a coral reef
And in its trails the city swallows us and you let yourself go
Oh, you let yourself go
[Verse 5: Yelle]
Everything goes so fast around your body
The noise of the colors
Everything blends and your heart lifts itself up again
When your eyes close
In this maze with nowhere to hide
You're like a tadpole
Lost in the beautiful center of a coral reef
And in its trails the city swallows us and you let yourself go
Oh, you let yourself go

[Bridge]
Taken into the vicious spiral
You've raised the sails
Ready for the battle

[Verse 1]
You'll see that it's your chance
The people come here and everything restarts
In the middle of the sounds of the city
You arrived all timidly
Lost in the scenery
Heart in the air and eyes that devour
All the tastes of the city
That called you between their lines
That called you between their lines"
7826,"[Verse 1]
Something 'bout the way the highway meets my eyes in twos
Tell me everything you know; tell me something new
I wanna drive your El Dorado straight into the sun
You're the shotgun by my side, horizon in your eyes

I hear Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio

[Verse 2]
Can I choose to feel this way for the rest of my days?
This is a great unknown; open road is my home
With your top down, we'll find the gateway to the stars
Into the great unknown; Mama's a rolling stone

[Chorus]
This could be love cause Bob Marley's playing on the radio
Well, Bob Marley's playing on the radio
I wanna move in close; girl, don't you tell me no
Bob Marley's playing on the radio

6543,"Standing at a crossroad snow still falling down
Misery loves company and a companion could be found
What started as a conquest had ended in defeat
The way we were the things we said and all i won't repeat
New years eve ain't all its cracked up to be
I've seen the best and heard the worst and everything in between
18hrs is such a long
Long time and the sting of painful words destroy us inside
Our silence can say so much and our words pack a painful punch
Nothing can take away the memories of that day and i was so sure that we'd fade away
Fade away
Adversity makes us stronger
So can we make this last a little longer?
Can we put aside the competition that resides in all of us, in all of us?
I know it's in me and i've seen it in you
But i set my sights on seeing this one through
I am gonna see it through
I know that we'll never fully agree
But it's worth my time and its worth the risk because this is family"

They're waiting for the rain to finally go outside

The window is open
And I hear them yell my name
I barely see the headlights
From the road close to my place

I'm asking to my soul if I'm real, if I'm really here
'Cause I've been feeling so alone
And the moon helped me to grow 5' 7"" tall
That's why I know

I know where the clouds hide
They're waiting for the rain to finally go outside
I know it's hard to imagine

I heard that they wait the rain so they can go outside
I guess it's hard to imagine

A bit more tomorrow

Without the struggles

9398,"Complex structures in complex times often may not instigate the eagerness to learn but rather the need for simple explanations
This is the hour of soul-hunters and sects

Born into a world
Where you don't know where's your place
Too fast, life is all around
So you've fallen from grace

Suddenly you found them
Or did they find you?
They walked by your side
And you knew what to do?

You searched for the light
Finally you got baptised
You longed for inner peace
But your soul got a disease

Lords of the new church, pierce your soul with lies
Self-flagellation, their precious advice
Equivocation, mesmerized by the holy ghost
Church of salvation, mental ossuary of mine
I stare into your eyes
And see a world behind
Mesmerized by lies
A view of another kind
Your former life forgotten
Buried and betrayed
You've now sold your soul
As salvation is what they said

You are chanting
They are laughing

Newborn, to praise his glory
Reborn, but dead
You've sworn an oath of holy
Reborn, but dead

Lords of the new church, pierce your soul with lies
Self-flagellation, their precious advice
Equivocation, mesmerized by the holy ghost
Church of salvation, mental ossuary of mine"
846,"Modern day people are so pig headed
More likely to believe in aliens than
A creator that’s benevolent
We have verifiable proof of the existence of God
But not once have laid eyes on  intelligence from afar

I’m not saying aliens don’t exist but I haven’t seen one
But I’ve looked in the face of a child and seen
Gods son
They say evolution is proof that Gods not real
How can that be when God was perfect and free
To create us randomly
With out any order
And yet you look at our bodies and we can see we’re made for much more
Than to eat sleep and die
We can think reason and cry
Feel hope and dream
Kiss laugh and smile
Hug jump and scream
We cannot deny
The fact that god came among us
To serve as a Slave
To take the brunt of our weight
And to take away
The stain of sin that our fathers left
By being disobedient
Modern day people are so pig headed
More likely to believe in aliens than
A creator that’s benevolent
We have verifiable proof of the existence of God
But not once have laid eyes on  intelligence from afar

God so love us he gave us his son
That whoever shall believe
Will not die
But live eternally
At the right hand in the sky
In my world view faith comes from reason
And trumps science every time
The Jesus Christ crew ain’t nothing to mess with
A bunch of atheists on twitter acting like punk kids
But it doesn’t matter because we know where our crew is
It’s at the church and hidden inside of the bread kid
We take that body and blood and we know what the truth is
That Christ is on earth in the form of the Eucharist
We have to praise him or we would be stupid
To think all of this is made because of just mad chemics

Modern day people are so pig headed
More likely to believe in aliens than
A creator that’s benevolent
We have verifiable proof of the existence of God
But not once have laid eyes on  intelligence from afar
Modern day people are so pig headed
More likely to believe in aliens than
A creator that’s benevolent
We have verifiable proof of the existence of God
But not once have laid eyes on  intelligence from afar"

Cowboys don’t want cowgirls
We want guitars, we want tombstones
Zoom out with my girl, she’s my new home
Ride my new home into a poem (sunset)
She holds for morning light
Few more hours til sun rise, bar last night
Was lonesome, a grave sight
Walk you home, come inside

[Chorus]
Only for tonight
I’m staying only for tonight
(Hold me, Hold Me)

[Verse 2]
Forget myself around you, show me expanse
You a song and dance, you got mansion demands
Spent a summer in New York, now you think you’re from France
Fingertip question: what’s left when nothing else is?
Hands search for answers, the clueless night
Walk around the room till our tombs done, mourning light
Speak enlightenment till my tongue turns, We’re twisted up
Unlearning the sunrise, performing our love

Only for tonight
I’m staying only for tonight

STAT-60 satisfies 2C, the math GER, not the one for me
The Central Limit Theorem? Speak English
The Sum of Squares? I don’t need this
But I’m positive, studying hard, gotta pass this, no holds barred
But essay due last Thursday man, Moby Dick I understand
Up ’till five in the library, Meyer Lair, kind of scary
Asleep at eight then up at ten, missed the lecture can’t pretend
I get the null hypothesis… on Tuesday’s test, I was dissed

Got STAT-60 on my mind
In my notes and in my rhymes
Chi-squared values all the time
Easy quarter? Not this time

Why’d you have to go and make things so complicated, Professor Thomas?
Never are the quiz score grades ever inflated, but you taught this:
You get involved in radio, work really hard, get your own show
But whoops, you slip, and play a track, uncensored as matter of fact
The FCC gets on your back, the station manager says it’s whack
The probability that you’ll loose your show on 90.1? 1.0
Let’s say that you’re late for class, racing down peddling fast
You live in A, class is at B, integrate time and velocity
The probability that you’ll crash your bike
In White Plaza on the way to Psych, .34 on your cell phone, .85 if you hit a cone
[REPEAT Hook]

Let’s say you meet this hot sophomore, she likes you, you can’t ignore
X the months that you date, P the probability that it’s great
You break up but you still kiss, you’re not discrete it’s continuous
Late night hook ups nebulous, thin line friendship no big fuss
Weekly sessions on the phone, made the right choice, you’re on your own
Good to be single all alone, degrees of freedom you can’t clone
But calculate E of X, you’re at a party you see your ex
The probability that your heart breaks in 2
She’s with someone new and it’s not you

Every love song is a sad song
If you've been there then you've had one
If you've been there then you've had one

Silence, it's finally silent
Instead of the crying
This moment I can be everything
I am in spite of you trying
To see my light dim
Everything I've been through
Made me a fighter
It made me shine brighter
I've been through hell and lived to tell the tale
And you became a shell of yourself
But I can't remind you
The grave is so final
I pray that this finds you miserable

Oh, time can't heal the pain you've caused
My heart still feels the way it was
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I pray this finds you miserable

Empty, each promise was empty
You'd give it again
Then you'd do it again
Maybe the broken parts are what made me
I'm tested in fire
It made me go higher
I built my wings from broken things
I pray wherever you are that there's no rest for you
I wish I had in my heart to wish the best for you
But forgiveness is difficult and I don't have that to give to you
No, I don't wanna sound spiteful
I'll just pray that this finds you miserable

My heart still feels the way it was
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Oh, so close to closure
But you've hurt me over and over again
Glad it's over again

Oh, time can't heal the pain you've caused

Who you want, what you want? Gates uh uh

Uncoordinated according to the accordion
Player with the tight squeeze compressing the keys
Making the mic scream
BBC jeans, what you mean, you know ice cream
This the theme for this evening
Please give me a reason
But hold up, never mind forever fly, that is I
Someone else you'll never find anyone else should never try
I'm the guy, try to bolt me to the floor
I came from under that
Vibrant colors, street related dying over violent colors
Striving to be better than I used to be
Usually I speak the truth for fools who've been confusing me
Food for my platoon to eat enthused with opportunity
Put that on my soon to be symbolizing unity
Bread winners association built this off influencing
Niggas with figures to come together
You know, you and me, him and her
Matching beamer Coupes that say his and hers
Self respect break apart the image when it isn't yours

Unidentified flying objects
Or ejected special weapons out the cockpit of the chopper
AR-15 with the inf beam
Don't tempt me, it's tempting
My orange juice, is simply, delicious
GOT LEAN IN IT
This green shit that I set on fire, and inhale, got me lifted
I'm so hood, I am that, you talk stupid get blam'd at
This new car drove too far got two broads who love Gates
Relationship, love hate, two mistakes can't budge fate
Stomach pudgy, both of them got something in it, they tummy for me for me
Guess that I'm a father, I got twins, gotta win
No pretending this that Peter Pan
Give a fiend a gram
Watch how easily it leave her hand, guess she need it bad
I ain't got it now she leavin' mad, all I do is stare
I don't comprehend, its a condition, I don't even care

And I guess I always will
That winter day I took the westbound flight
As I looked down from the plane
You were standing in the rain
You waved goodbye til' I was out of sight

And I can see them shining
Through the willows and the pines
The lights of Cincinnati
Oh, so many miles behind
I could build myself a new life
And make it on my own
But the lights of Cincinnati
Will be calling me back home

Sometimes late at night
I watch the firelight
Make pictures of a life that used to be
For a moment I'm back there
In that same old rocking chair
You look across the room and smile at me

Through the willows and the pines
The lights of Cincinnati

But I guess the years had settled him down some

But he made me swear that Grandma would never know
His ranch is nine miles north of Civil's Bend
And in all my years I've still never met no one like him

He was six-feet-two from his cowboy boots to his worn our Co-Op cap
He was slow to rile but you didn't wanna make him mad
He had a gentle soul with a heart of gold, but he did things his own way
With just the right amount of renegade

He'd say, ""Put it on the table, Mable. What's takin' you so long?
My belly's gnawin' on my old backbone""
She'd been with him so long she din't pay him any mind
He'll slap her on the tail but she won't mind
He'd eat the hottest habanero on the plate
And talk about how good it was, and never make a face

He was six-feet-two from his cowboy boots to his worn our Co-Op cap
He was slow to rile but you didn't wanna make him mad
Had a gentle soul with a heart of gold, but he did things his own way
With just the right amount of renegade

We'd always honk the horn as we pulled out of the drive
While grandma stood there wavin', he'd flip us off and smile
Yeah that was just his style

Getting on her glow
Righteous woman surrendering
To the full ecstatic flow

Glinting in the tenth row

On her dressing room door
She takes the note and reads it
Then lets it drop to the floor

To the backstage door

I could keep it one hundred but y'all don't feel me though
I tried to be a man, but these streets turned me to a nigga though
And these streets is all I know
This Hennessy and weed is all I know
But tell me how can I come back from it?
Or tell me how do I react to it?
Hey God what is it you asked from me?
This ain't what I wanted
Oh no, this ain't what I wanted still
I tried to give you what you wanted
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Maino]
Uh, look, will I die before I see forever?
I wanna fly, do I need propellers?
I tried but I thought bein' a G was better
They say I'm like Pac in the streets for niggas
Now who would think that I receive a sentence?
Ran out my mama's house and became a legend
Battle scars, jail bars seem scary
Prayin' to a black god, do you hear me?
Shots flyin', niggas duckin', shawty hit though
It's my fault, I'm the one that she was with yo
Past hauntin' me, the devil keep tauntin' me
Sorry mama, know that this ain't what you wanted from me
I know you hurtin' when they blame me
Wish they'd have told me this would flame me
So now I draw my pain in them painkillers
Damn, guess this what the game get you

Last year I watched my lil homies turn haters
Same ones that I raised, now they got the vapors
Lost friends, gained brothers, let it fall apart
It's all material, Ricky lost my Audemar (still love him)
Love and loyalty, thugs gon' relate to me
'Cause black males in the country feel the same pain
Yeah, back and forth, going through the drama
She hate me, that's a text from my daughter's mama (why?)
Tryna' find peace but all I found was liquor
Fell asleep drunk, woke up with a different stripper
Jesus piece swinging as I battle demons
All I wanted was the money, fame wasn't needed
Had a friend that used to tell me life is what you make it
Said you can't enjoy life unless you fully taste it
Then they found him with some holes in him
I can still hear him screamin' nigga go get 'em

Rock and Roll means well, but it can't help tellin' young boys lies
A baby on the way's a good enough reason to get you out alive
Get you out without having to swallow any pride

All my friends are restless, all they do is talk it down
Two or eight lanes, it don't matter, it's just another town
There's a fool on every corner, on every street, in every one
And I'd rather be your fool nowhere than go somewherе and be no one's

So marry me, sweet thing won't you marry mе
Your mama thinks I beat anything she's ever seen
This old town's alright with me, there's nowhere I'd rather be
Long as they stay mad at one another, they can't get mad at me

Every time I leave here something bad happens to me
Like a busted hand or finding some man laying where I sleep
She don't mean nothing to me, that's just how it goes round here
It's a cartoon town, I play my part, and I ain't spoke her name in years
So marry me...
I don't want anything I done to be nobody's fault
Even if they got more money and mouth than they got balls
That's just how it went down, right or wrong, it's just that way
Just ‘cause I don't run my mouth don't mean I got nothing to say...

Marry Me..."

I keep, gettin so high

Think I’m finally starting to feel Happi

Now I’m waking up earlier tryna make the most of my day
Flowers blooming, so are we, so much sacred in the month of May
And it feels so right lookin in your eyes
But at the same time, I’m kinda terrified
Really wanna hold on tight to this one
Could play it cool but these feelings are too strong
I, can't help it
Think I might let myself fall in ____ again
Jump all in, take a chance, stop thinking this’ll end
And you, wanna know why
I, keep gettin so high
I guess I was tryna hide
But now I don’t feel the need
Think I'm finally startin to feel happi

Didn't know something like this could exist
Lookin like neither one of us can resist
Cross the country now but I still feel your lips

That will take you around the world:
In the belly of the vessels
Stowed away nine pirate girls

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)

One named Polly had a parrot
The second named Polly had a parrot, too
That's the part that is confusing
And they were identical twins

The third was Nancy, she was fancy
Walked around with a fake tattoo
And four through nine were all named Peggy
And each one only wore one shoe

Nine Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Legend grew about their daring
Never did they walk the plank
They all shared one golden earring
And the truth is they all stank

If you finished all your homework
Brushed your teeth, and done your chores
And it's not too past your bedtime
Then your folks might tell you more of the

Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine)
Pirate girls, pirate girls, pirate girls nine

4098,"O loyal to the royal in thyself,
And loyal to thy land, as this to thee—
Bear witness, that rememberable day,
When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince
Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again
From halfway down the shadow of the grave,
Past with thee through thy people and their love,
And London rolled one tide of joy through all
Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man
And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,
The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime—
Thunderless lightnings striking under sea
From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,
And that true North, whereof we lately heard
A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves;
So loyal is too costly! friends—your love
Is but a burthen: loose the bond, and go.'
Is this the tone of empire? here the faith
That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice
And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont
Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?
What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak
So feebly? wealthier—wealthier—hour by hour!
The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,
Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?
There rang her voice, when the full city pealed
Thee and thy Prince! The loyal to their crown
Are loyal to their own far sons, who love
Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes
For ever-broadening England, and her throne
In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,
That knows not her own greatness: if she knows
And dreads it we are fallen. —But thou, my Queen,
Not for itself, but through thy living love
For one to whom I made it o'er his grave
Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,
New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,
Ideal manhood closed in real man,
Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,
Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,
And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him
Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one
Touched by the adulterous finger of a time
That hovered between war and wantonness,
And crownings and dethronements: take withal
Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven
Will blow the tempest in the distance back
From thine and ours: for some are scared, who mark,
Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,
Waverings of every vane with every wind,
And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,
And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,
And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,
Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,
Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,
Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,
And that which knows, but careful for itself,
And that which knows not, ruling that which knows
To its own harm: the goal of this great world
Lies beyond sight: yet—if our slowly-grown
And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense,
That saved her many times, not fail—their fears
Are morning shadows huger than the shapes
That cast them, not those gloomier which forego
The darkness of that battle in the West,
Where all of high and holy dies away."
149,"This stain on my flesh is all so real
I'm inconsistent with my life and my walk, but with forgiveness I will stand up
Time and time again, day after day
This battle that's inside me makes me sick with guilt
This God that is love renews me with hope
So pick yourself off the ground son
Wipe away the blood and tears
This spirit I give you is not of fear, but of discipline and love
Life is real, God is real, His love is real"
9820,"I speak with rhythm
So cats know I’m with ‘em
Freestylin’?
No, But still swimming
Charming woman, but not winning
With lips dry but hips swinging
Hearts?
No… but minds I’m in ‘em
See I’m sly and grinning
And she’s into sinning
I hear her moan between linen
But then again, it’s a given
With her, thighs like vice, and eyes like “nice”
She smiles for miles, and goes blind like mice
And sighs like thrice, So, why think twice
Is it modesty? Possibly
Maybe I stole affection, like robbery
She’s acting coy, not dogging me
So with swag like so… what stopping me?
I feel frustration dropping me
So no time for pop ‘n’ locking G
I search for answers properly
Honestly, I’m onto thee
And then I saw her on a…
Rainy corner, a black and gold street
Homeward bound, feel that neon-light beat
Heat, through the cold when she came in close
And like D.H. Lawrence our confronted souls
Had momentary relief from a daily pose
The path less travelled, is the path we chose
So… take notice, and see soft focus
And transition… seamlessly
With, mood no mar and film like noir
And ignition…. Come dream with me

----

A rainy corner, a cornerside apartment
A Neverending story, can’t remember when he started
Cold coffee chilled on an open window sill
Hand on incessant quill, but yet to find his fill

Thoughts by the mil, plans thwarted by the thrill
Biological musts, lusts, tortured by the real
Mental distrusts, mind engaged in memories kiss
From a memory’s miss, or was it memories missed?

Honestly, he feels, the reals just slipped
Dreary, like Dali, the time just drips
A glance shoots to his sheets; thinks ‘call it a night’
But feels dry eyes catch a glimmer of moonlight

Feels like, healing lights, lit up, her essence
Her presence, a present at least for the present
But fleeting, heart beating, her divine intervention
Back to his pen, chained like, pen-like-detention
Ethereal embodiment, seducer of sages
Ill health, broken empires, a muse so dangrous
She ageless, as is the music that she came with
She’s played this, before, chronicle that spans ages
Tries to get her of his mind and onto tan pages
Pleads for relief but his need-to-know basis
Has lines of rhymes, chain-links like slavery
Senses scrape for imaginary imagery

Before she departs her perch, seamlessly
The wind transmits her words, ‘come dream with me’"

Shut the world down, told the sports they gotta stalock
Imma drip or drown, ain't tryna kick it with a bay thot
Login bank account, gon' invest it in all the same stock
King of fuckin' town, and I did it all with the same flock
Ain't religious, said I got a god complex
They be frivilous, jealous their bars are not complex
Got a problem, I promised tonight I'm not gon' flex
I'm the life of the party, just like that Shawn don' said
On a new crash course, got the drive, makin' hits
Boutta ride, fast forward, gettin' high right off the cliff
Got the three, four, five bands, drop it on a wrist
Wrist shots on my shawty, I know she like it like this

50 thousand on my neck and I just pulled up in a new porsche
Watchin' my patek, I got the drip just like a pool source
Water on my body, makin' waves up on the shores
On a flight back to Toronto, boy that could I'm from the true north
Bought a brand new phantom, boutta flex up in a two door
From LA to Atlanta, don't take no breaks I sold out two tours
Pulled up to her Cabana, she tryna study for a school course
Said she want me like Santa, I'll wrap up, faster than a race course

I’m from the 702 but my heart cold
Dripping on my neck 50 k I’m a narco
Pill in my cup got moving in slow mo
Heart cold heart froze I don’t deal with sorrow oh no
Fucking that bitch sideways
Killing the pussy like 9 ways
Speeding on the highway
All cash when I pay
My chain on drip drip
These hoes been on my dick
Keep a 40 on my hip
Fuck around and get hit
Money on my mind ima die rich
Meds in my system high risk
Fucking that bitch then I lane switch
50k straight to her face when my chain hit

50 thousand on my neck and I just pulled up in a new porsche
Watchin' my patek, I got the drip just like a pool source
Water on my body, makin' waves up on the shores
On a flight back to Toronto, boy that could I'm from the true north
Bought a brand new phantom, boutta flex up in a two door
From LA to Atlanta, no breaks till I sell out a few tours

He came out of thin air
Plucked from a vision
Darkness arrived and he succumbed in an instant
The son of the system
Immortal yet ephemeral
Chemicals can end it all, turn this grey to an emerald
It’s too simple if seminal’s digestible
Don’t mind the peers making spectacles of genitals
Forget the present but reject it when the heavens call
Make you question all you are then vanish I'm inspector Goole
Actions imply that he loves the regret
Suffering less when the skunks bunned and up in his chest
Stash under the bed above are the puddles of sweat
Transcendent but still stuck in the mesh
Write it off as taradiddle
Back in the shack and crippled
Carrying sacrificial
Lambs like a pack of gristle
Scapegoats as he changes into plain clothes
Stay low dodging Bobbies in this rain coat
To mask the halo that only he can recognize
Methodize dimensions from the present to the second life
Take to heaven skies excavate and televise
Let the masses see the barren land they were set to find
Every second’s like certain eternity
Been to hell and back strapped with burns to the third degree
Lurch to emergency
Then murmur in surgery
Telling tales of the mishaps of purgatory
Even the vermin bleed
And cry to the cosmos
This life in a lost plot
Is trite till the clock stops
Still he survives wading his way through monotony
The phantom of a man trapped in the forgotten prophecy
Looms"

Yo I could rap about the Jordan’s that I can’t afford
Or my friends facing trials on a different court
The same ones who be artistic individuals
With herbal rituals that define draw, or I could explore
The concept of, sexual deception
When Eve tells Adam she’s prescribed contraception
When she really hasn’t and she ain't looking for no spouse
But your seed, she can breed to a ticket out her mother’s house
The female of twenty twelve is cunning
They see you coming, then consequently you cum in
So cover up when you’re fucking, or find yourself in a situation you stuck in
With a chick that means nothing
Or I could rap about my personal ambitions
Career prospects or the fucking fact that there isn’t
Or my homie doing life inside prison
Who I haven’t seen in years and undoubtedly miss him
Or I could rap about the harsh reality of debt
Or the stress I’m receiving, coz I can’t pay the rent
Or my mother tears dealing with the death
Of her dad whilst taking tests for cancer in the breast
Or I could admit, and simply spit that I’m scared
Coz I don’t fucking feel myself and don’t see a repair
Yo and I just want my health man this shit isn’t fair
Or I could just rhyme about you

Or I could just rhyme about you girl
Or I could just rhyme about you

It’s bizarre that just a plant can escalate into a drama
Were my mother blames my dealer, but my dealer blames the farmer
But the only one to blame is I, Don’t mis-interpretate
The HGH, when getting baked, as letters that dis-illusion
Your inclusion to getting high, Were only human
You have your reason and I have nine, Yo that’s an understatement
Or I could rap about my friends on there life ascend
Heading out the city to study and how I’m proud of them
Although I’m envious
Coz my endeavors into further education, just resulted into emptiness
Or I could rap about how I’m sick of insomnia
In correspondence to completing thee extra kilometer
To compete for the key to reveal the concealed corridor
They constantly critiqued, forgetting my name is Oliver
Which means I want more, Or I could rap about
The fathers of my generation walking out that front door
To never return, or show any concern
Or to ever see they’re seed just spelling their first words, check it
Or I could rap about the cars that I’d love to drive
Or the bus I have to bunk just to catch a ride
I can't help but think, tell me is this really life

Turned water into soju, got your facts wrong

Words & Music by Allison Crowe

Take your sympathy and shove it
As for the pain
Well, I love it
I'll eat your words
I'll devour your soul
I will laugh like a lemur
As you crawl back into your hole

I won't deny you
But I'll pay you no heed
And, if you keep stabbing me
I will probably bleed
But, I'll pretend I'm a cloud
And my rain will surround you
And if you keep hurting me
I'll eventually drown you
And, yes I know
I'm a little bit off

But, you, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen you before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
You will do this again and again
But you will never learn

So keep looking down
As you crush me keep smiling
'cause I will get up
And there's no denying
That I am one of your punching clowns
You can keep on striking
But you can't keep me down

You always think that you
Are fearless and right
But I think that you
Are afraid in the night
Of the ghosts, of the spirits
That crawl into your head
Of the skeletons that'll haunt you
Until you're dead
But, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen you before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
You will do this again and again and again and again

But, now, you can't leave, you can't open the door
You think you're unique but I've seen it all before
So run, run away from the fires that burn
But you will never learn
You will never learn
You will never learn"

Nothing lasts forever

3796,"Saint Leonard touched a Philistine
A sacred tongue, a perfect rhyme
But even he was ""not much nourished
By modern love.""

So I told her that everything she does is divine
And she replied with a blank expression
(an object lesson in making me feel benign)
Then whispered, ""Independence and indifference
Are the wings which allow the heart to fly.""

Feelings I have had too often
Still no plan in place
To soften the inevitable blow
(the rituals we know)
And with the right revolting piety of tone
The word ""freedom""
Can make you want to lock yourself
In a deep dark dungeon

But everybody follows pleasure
Everybody gets somewhere, I swear
I wish I could be less aware
Now it's absolutely clear to me
That solitude is not the same as singularity
But that's not why I'm lonely
No, that's not why I'm lonely"

Can you feel my heart
I will give you all the love in my heart

Seeing you smile
And seeing that smile so bright
I'm smiling, too
I'm happier, look at me

To convey my heart
I've been working hard on everything i’ve prepared
I answered with a bright smile
I feel joy
Like your bright light, here we are
It makes it even brighter, thank you
I’m happy that you accepted my heart

Come enjoy with me
Let's enjoy it together, feel it, open your heart
Can you feel my heart
I will give you all the love in my heart
Come enjoy with me
Let’s enjoy it together, feel it, open your heart
Can you feel my heart

On the video and IG but believe me
That I wasn't always happy but I stayed me
And I praise me

You ever felt a campfire in the woods
You gotta spark when I was on a camping trip without a candle in the dark so don't forget your headlamp
Paddle boats until she damp, like I was forced to take a chance, no hesitation when I dance
Jacket or the jersey, I was cold but never turkey
When they said I wasn't worthy, untouchable, try to hurt me
Focused on the mission when I got no ammunition
Gotta learn to train your mind and keep your ties to tradition, whoa
Elegant from hood shit
Chronic from the wood tip
Release a couple thoughts but that's just every time the woods split
Need to shine, I've seen the shadows, won the war and lost the battle, bareback with horsepower, tell 'em we don't need the saddle
Ring around the rosey with the mob to keep it cozy
They won't say it to your face but watch the haters, they be nosey
So - keep your head up and steady movin' like the lunch line
Pocket full of posers and the one to count the sunshine
Spectrum

A cold gun aimed at the trial
And I’ve been running on for so long
Here’s your fall out, though you’re trying
The colors fade out because they’re dying
And I’ve been painting love for so long

It’s hard to say, the world won’t wait for me
No, nothing is going to change
I tried to pay my debt and feel free
No, my dollar bill will live on as change

“Good morning, sunshine, awake when the sun hits the sky”
The lies you told to me until the day that I woke up and died
The song sung out for me, the most sobering tune
That my life was love, my love was lost, and it was lost within you

It’s hard to say, the world won’t wait for me
No, nothing is going to change
I tried to pay my debt and feel free
No, my dollar bill will live on as change

My presence is deceiving
I’m leaving"

Where my baby used to lay?

One drink of wine
Two drinks of gin
Pretty young got me
In the shape I'm in

Come and see me early in the morning
Just about the break of day
Want to see me hug my pillow

Look through the door
She's doing the boogie-woogie
In the middle of the floor
Come and see me early in the morning

We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon;
How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver,
Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon
Night closes round, and they are lost for ever:

Or like forgotten lyres, whose dissonant strings
Give various response to each varying blast,
To whose frail frame no second motion brings
One mood or modulation like the last.

We rest.—A dream has power to poison sleep;
We rise.—One wandering thought pollutes the day;
We feel, conceive or reason, laugh or weep;
Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away:

It is the same!—For, be it joy or sorrow,
The path of its departure still is free:
Man's yesterday may ne'er be like his morrow;
Nought may endure but Mutability."

I wake up in the morning feeling so free
I stretch up and I yawn and Icrack my feet
N put on my house shoes and go brush my teeth

I jump in the shower just to start a new
Bumpin' Marvin Gayes album so pardon my groove
I be singing and a washing till I'm pot colour proof
That's my Ordinary, Ordinary

Break out the big comb so I can pick my fro
My hair is nappy grown so it never flows
Like the wind is blowing in and out of my window

I got goals I meet to maintain my wealth

Have to see if what I'm rocking is the flyest shit
And if I'm not so fresh and clean (I run and change real quick)
That's my Ordinary, Ordinary

I jump in my ride and mash up the block
Just to blaze my radio at every other stop
And to show my system off I turn it up a notch
That's my Ordinary, Ordinary

Then I see this fly shawty tried to give her a holla
Before I asked her name she asked me do I have dollars (do you have any money)
I jungles my last 50 cents and didn't even bother

The least a man can do is fight for a just cause
Engulfed within flames and eternal black
The stars whirl in furious motion
Vast army of horrors, it is your time
We shall rule this underworld
In darkness we prevail, leaving nothing behind
But the torn flesh of your coward horde!
Inconceivable amounts in the wake
One last maneuver shall save our race

Rally the army of demons
Brandishing steel forged in fire
To rattle the mortals above us
Onto their knees their forced to kneel

Exit the hall, the soothsayer's call
Through space and time forever evil lasts

His throat shall be slit, his blood shall be spilled
Man made a slave, king in a grave
Soothsayers triumph is near
The kings head sits on a spear

From the gates of hell, he has arrived
Fire demons in the sky
Whips and chains, the grand display
Of pain and fierce brutality

Centuries pass on for the sorcerer
Familiar faces pass him by
A challenge to fight, to spoil his soul
As he smiles on golden throne

The soothsayers triumph is near
The kings head sits on a spear

For he is me, but without power
And in this final combat
Aid from the dark one, I’ll be victorious
To bring the cycle to an end

Amassed so far below
Seeing all there was to see

On top of hell's highest peak
Horde of horrors, governing the weak
Blackened skies filled with devils
Aberrations from lowest levels
Amassed so far below
Seeing all there was to see

On top of hell's highest peak
Horde of horrors, governing the weak
Blackened skies filled with devils
Aberrations from lowest levels

Toppled king, thwarted knight
To the ends of their mortal universe
Hellish horde, fight, fight!
The cruel, the morally perverse

Soothsayers triumph is near
The kings head sits on a spear

Abomination, abscess
Poison turns it’s horrid face
Evil on the face of evil
Forever scourge the human race"

How could you leave me on my own
You know I hate to sleep alone

Remember how it used to be
When you were here with me
You were the only one I've known
And how I hate to sleep alone

Ups and downs like a sea-saw ride

Yea,that made you bright
So I took shots wichu,we got drunk in love
Now you sober prolly wasn't just drunk enough
You made a lotta vows prolly need a lawyer

Always be misjudged
Running away

And all my worries would go away
Everything would be different if I knew
This state would be the end"

The hazelnuts that fell out of the trees
Underneath which we danced and we laid
The happiest moments without money

Topped the charts so many times, I’m having so much fun

When I open my mouth and sing
My competition will feel a little sting
After all I’m a killer bee
Flopping? no that ain’t for mе

Chocolate cakes are so tasty, I was born to bе jailed
You left me in the ditch but I walked out of there
When I sting I promise it will hurt
If you make me mad I’ll make it burn
The bubbling under artists think they’re better
Let me show you how it’s done
Pay me some money and then maybe
I’ll teach you how to get a number one

Count them I have 4 number ones
Topped the charts so many times, I’m having so much fun

When I open my mouth and sing
My competition will feel a little sting
After all I’m a killer bee
Flopping? no that ain’t for me
When I open my mouth and sing
My competition will feel a little sting"

Do you like the things
That life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know

Do you get
What you're hoping for
When you look behind you
There's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you know

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies
That filled our minds
You knew I loved you
But my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions
That you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things
That life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know

Do you get
What you're hoping for
When you look behind you
There's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you know

Now looking back
At all we've planned
We let so many dreams
Just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long
Before we'll see
How sad the answers
To those questions can be"
7544,"[Verse]
I was born on a rainy day
With a dark cloud hanging down low
Now it follows me wherever I go
There were days I've sworn that I'd blow away
With the cold wind chilling my bones
'Cause it follows me wherever I go

[Verse]
In the midnight hour when I'm all alone
There's a hurting deep down in my soul
And it follows me wherever I go
When the sun shines down on my heart, it's gone
There's another night coming, I know
'Cause it follows me wherever I go

[Verse]
I could drink corn whiskey till my brain goes soft
I could run this highway till my wheels come off
And these blues keep coming around and follow me down
Well one of these days I'm going to leave this town
But I won't have to travel alone
'Cause if follows me wherever I go
[Verse]
I could drink corn whiskey till my brain goes soft
I could run this highway till my wheels come off
And these blues keep coming around and follow me down
I want to go somewhere where I can't be found
And I won't have to carry this load
But it follows me wherever I go"
8874,"Let me turn my
Chair around to sit
And talk with you
Voltaire Slap
Hella buzzing off the juice
Rarely leave my house
These days
Ain't got shit to do
All I got is my music and my
PlayStation too
That's PlayStation also
And all sorts of booze
Ask what I'm playing
What I'm jamming
Both DOOM
Asking when I'll make it
If I'm famous
Woah dude
You're being tom petty
You need to tom wait a sec
Body is a wonderland
Mind is a playground set
Many folks greatly overrated
Like they're Megadeth
But VS cult greatness
Fear and loathing in
Las Vegas shit
Wait for me to
Raging quit well
That's a big old
Maybe if
Like maybe if you go on YouTube
Leave a nasty comment
I'll get around to reading
When we next see Halley's Comet
2061
That's 40 whole years
I don't want nothing except
Only more beer
And a ton of the green sack
I mean that dear
No tales out of school
No fibbing that's a rule
Being sincere
Hella clear
But I'm cool
Soberish at noon
Pissy before 2
Like Kamala Harris flip flops
I switch up my mood

Moving the sample
Arranging the loop
Finding a good one
Or making one new
Unlimited sources
Set forth and produce
There’s always
Gonna be supporters
As well as those that
Hate what you do
But that don't pertain to
The truth
Maintain beyond changing
Of routes
Retain the same refrain
Of creativity put to
Good use
Puzzles in all of the rooms
Stuck and you're hunting
For clues
Either you fail or give up
So that means there's
Nothing to lose
Adrift in the drugs and
The booze
With my screws
All suitably
Loose
All the way out and
I'm brutally smooth
Never going down that's
Inscrutably true
Never too subtle
I tower and loom
Straight up
Dwarfing the
Mountains I move
As I howl at the moon
With these powerful tools
Calling out all
My doubters as fools
Like these
Class cucked
Musk stans
Who outright devour the boot

I don't need a mansion
I still got a roof
All I need is a place
Can kick off my shoes
At home with the wife
And the dog hella cute
See me locked in the studio
Sauced making tunes
Sitting on my notes writing
Blessings just for you
Playing Dark Souls with Skep
Or getting stressed out by the news
Some find my lyrics funny but they're
Funny cause they're true
Like what we gonna do
In life there is no Funky Mode
We're all just fucking screwed
It really isn't funny
Though
We fucked up
Something serious
But everybody's
Ears are closed
They do not care for hearing it"

Put your bitch to bed
I don’t give a fuck about a little fucking sped
You the type of bruh to live in a shed
It’s all about the money
It’s all about the virus

Someone getting paid
You ain’t in your lane
Give a fuck about the fame
That shit will not keep me tame
Nah

My choppa got your name on it
I don’t want a McFlurry, I’m not really being honest
This dick you can hop on it
“A” is for apple, like we’re talking phonics
Come in your store with no mask, now you got it
You mad about the weed bitch you bought it
You got that dog shit
Can’t see through this fog shit

Why the fuck you pouting like a bitch
Look like you swallowed a finch
Copped new JLab’s I’m feeling ri-shit
I don’t fucking flinch
Reflexes on point
Baby I got that shit in my groin
That- that dick in my groin
That sperm in my bank

Tried to leave but came back like Michael
Every drough is like a ... fight through
Sometimes it have a nigga not remembering
Got me hypnotized like a shrink with a pendulum
Gotta get it in, late nights like Letterman
A nigga gotta bring that...and please don't stop

Slow money turn fast, time to ... up

But I cannot leave you alone baby, I need you

You're a little bit late
We rolled up the sidewalks
At a quarter to eight
It's a small town
We can't sell you no beer

May I ask what you're doin' here

Hey what you up to
I already know
I heard the boys
Talkin' at the Texaco
It's a small town
I know how you feel
It's a small town, son
And the news travels
Quicker than wheels

Who you lookin' for
What was his name
You can prob'ly find him
At the football game
It's a small town
You know what I mean
It's a small town, son
And we all support the team
The preacher drove by in his Cadillac
I waved at him but he didn't wave back
It's a small town
Everybody knows your face
It's a small town, son
And we all must know our place

They can suck my cack

Put some spin in your back
Fuck you & your gat, trying to shoot back

On your carcass it will feast
Your soul will never rest in peace

Cause as long as i exist, your pain will never seize
I'm someone you don't want to make pissed
Cause i'm the type that will beat your face in with my fist
And drag your body to a discreet place through the mist

Thrown them from towers above
To prove your power and love

When they stole my sons and burned me alive?

But maybe that was all in my mind…

Is this some test to
Make me stronger
Well I can’t take it
Any longer - are you there?

Always waiting
Why should I wait anymore?
What are you waiting for??

Well this is it, show yourself or I’m out, zoo-oh-oh, oh oh, oh oh…

We almost at the summertime, right
So I guess you can grab your stepping shoes
Snap your fingers
Play it real cool

So let me catch this tempo
Conviction settles in at that School of Roses intro
Yeah I'm on that, and I miss seeking forgiveness
I reflect on when these dry bones had turned into tendons
Dust turned into a choked up dude lacking composure
Inside himself a joy of the fact that He had me chosen
This new heart, y'all should have seen how I had broke mine
Substance abuser, a few steps from them coke lines
But praise Jesus, light burst through that black cloud
It's His glory, I just photobomb in the background
Exquisite, why shouldn't I be explicit
God himself wasn't embarrassed to call me His child, man
That last sentence, it got me breaking down
Breaking Bad got me addicted I was broken
Needed fixing from my fixes
I swore I stopped at 16
But done I opened up the wound, the doc opened up the womb
So please don't mind delivery, I'm feeling born again
Yo please don't mind my worship, I just saw a trampled serpent

Giving honor to God who's the head of my life
Pastor, first lady
Yo why do I act like I know that
Like a grew up in church or something

Now me catch this tempo
And encompass the Creator of creation with a pencil
It's an insult, but it's all I have
These autographs that chart a path to my Father's grasp
& fills my heart with gladness
I was within a cell within my self
I should have been sent to jail, I've been to hell
Within the center's where sin prevailed, a finished tale
And now I'm tryna give a ring to Jennah Bell
Praise Jesus, I face demons that mirror angels
From certain angles you can't see them
It's like you create heathens, set a bar that we can't reach
And force us to follow you while you make leaders
I chase divas, you chase me till I can't breathe
Just to give me breath when death's in HD
And I can't see
It's amazing my hand say I'm an atheist
Yet you choose to create in us
It's strange because God, you make all things new
Leave me in awe, cause all things are you
It's true"

Sit me on your front porch swing
And sing me something sweet until I fall asleep
You'll drive till you crash
But you always seem to want to go so fucking fast
That nothing ever lasts
And you just end up sleeping with the past
Something's always missing
And you know you're moving too slow

When there's no difference between diamonds and glass
Someday soon all the flowers are gonna bloom
And when they do, I'll be looking for you"

Thoughts up in my head and they illegal
Why you actin' up, and what’s the reason?
She a demon, she about the evil
[Verse 2: dinny]
She went this way, I was on this wave
Fuck about the paper, I was onto the next stage
What a mistake, guess I got bad brakes (heh)
Guess I got bad brakes

[Verse 3: tan!]
I don’t need brakes when I got all the intuition
It's been a mission of mine to overthrow the system
So fuck the riches, as long as I got ammunition
I put a bullet in the barrel, don’t know what I'm missing
So get the cheddar and dip man, I'm better off
No pressure, the best bet is I read it wrong
Off center, a right hook and a quick-draw
Take aim, and I click back, it's a clear shot

[Chorus: dinny]
Fire in my blood, do you need some?
Thoughts up in my head and they illegal
Why you actin’ up, and what's the reason?
She a demon, she about the evil
Fire in my blood, do you need some?
Thoughts up in my head and they illegal
Why you actin' up, and what's the reason?
She a demon, she about the evil"

I'm customized to do everything I shouldn't do
I've learned all that I know by stubbornness and blues
I got my schooling more or less on the street
My eyes have seen a thing or two, oh-oh
And though my heart has made me weary I like everything about you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

[Chorus]
I like the way you look, the way that you talk
I like the way that you move when you walk
My mind is set on you
My pelvis is on fire
And I can't shake it off
My b-b-b-b-b-b-brain is out of t-t-t-timing

[Verse 2]
What's life without any shaking?
A little bit of juicy pussy pin-up
The jukebox down in the corner needs a coin for a Sad Man's Tongue
When you shake that thing, I'm down on my old knees
You go girl, I'm in love with you, oh-oh
And though my heart has made me weary I like everything about you
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, yes I do
[Chorus]
I like the way you look, the way that you talk
I like the way that you move when you walk
My mind is set on you
My pelvis is on fire
And I can't shake it off
My b-b-b-b-b-b-brain is out of t-t-t-timing

I got a bullet living inside my head
I got a bullet living inside my head
I got a bullet living inside my head
I got a bullet living inside my head, oh-oh
I got a bullet living inside my head
Oh baby, bullet dear
Oh baby, bullet dear
Oh baby, bullet dear
Oh baby, bullet dear, oh"

It's getting late, I'm bout to miss my show
Where the fuck did you go
On this day that I'm leaving you, and I told you so
So she grabs my face, looks in my eyes
Asks me if I got high last night, but I didn't
I was smoking on weed, she was talking about the other kind
Something knocks at the door, and I leave forever
She wanna lay with me, trying stay with me
I'm dying now, I'm dying now

My hands shaking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
And I ain't been making a lot
My hands shaking a lot
I've been smoking a lot
And I ain't been making a lot
Xanax bars ain't making it stop
Xanax bars ain't making it stop

And I know I'm gonna leave someday, but it ain't today
You see me I'm kind of off, a little slurred when I talk
And them people in the street they be starring when I walk

Go ahead Mr. Businessman
You can't dress like me
Yeah

If I let a bitch breathe, she'll get ahead of me
Find another muthafucka, that she think way better than me
Let's hope you're embedded in me, cause I'm gone for good
I'm a see about a view things, Ricky misunderstood
I'm dying now, I'm dying now

On the edge of town
Holding hands
Waiting for the hounds

Grab your guns
Watch them drop like shells

Take take take take
Take back your sun"

Slash, get checked by the blade
It's not a homie when it's zombies, catch a tech to the face
I'm way more than player one, I'm the best in the game
I punch boulders using strength, I'll kill Wesker today
Mess with, Claire or Jill, I'll leave the scene, like my last name
B.O.W., say bow when the gat sprays
Bazooka to a Tyrant, I saved the day in the first game
Marvel vs Capcom 3, I got the best aim

I got the antibodies, these hands are for any body
Alive or undead pop off, I'm poppin off the semi Audi
Petty shawty, fine ass downin' twenty zombies
Ain't afraid to ""buck"", so I'm sluggin' with the shotty
Jill Valentine, pocket checking every friend of mine
You wanna drop bombs, well I keep the fuckin' time
Highest tier, still in my prime, try n' test me, best rewind
And tell that mother fucker Wesker, I'mma take his fuckin' spine

Albert Wesker, I'll confess I'm
Not really one to be down with lectures
Power flexer, now surrender
Relieve that pain like Alka-Seltzer
Scouted member, found by Spencer
'Bout to make them all bow with pressure
Now your left without a head
Profound and the best, these louts are lesser
I run this shit, captain, leader, tyrant, call me all them
The human race is pathetic, this strain's a cure for boredom
No more games, you'll be extinct like the Mastodon
It's all shade when this boss, puts his glasses on
[Barry Burton: Carter Sauce]
No Steakfries, yet Barry catching air
And ya know I got a clip or two to spare
Nah, you'll be the one who's scared
When you catch a round from me, in my underwear
Leave you red cuz I'm invested, so you'll also be disarmed
Right to the nose like you're congested, I guess I'll leave you seeing S.T.A.R.S
Let me take care of this, unload the mag like a newsstand
And I did help beat Nemesis, don't care if it ain't cannon man
B.S. double A., like your lies were charged, and I'm rapping it up like a bandage
Raise the roof, and drop it hot like, it was almost a ""Jill Sandwich""

[Rebecca Chambers: Knight of Breath]
Don't leech on me, if you're not prepared
I've seen more shit, that I don't need to share
Don't overlook me because my young age
You won't make it farm, without my brains
Defeating these beasts, that's my analysis
Not scared of this virus, I'm getting out of it
Put on the case by S.T.A.R.S., I'm dodging death
Officer Chambers at your service

[Billy Coen: AfroLegacy]
It's the kid surviving death row, and then you're next bro
Lieutenant on the scene, fulfilling missions, loaded, let's go
I ain't taking out the innocents, marine down, to my hardened core
Ain't part of the participants, get more than what you bargained for
Simply a survivor, the stars got my back
The king, I'm the provider, damn this world is out of wack
See me handling my business, cause the fire still be burning
I'm the madman in the shadows, so who knows if I'm returning
[Leon S. Kennedy: BAKER The Legend]
What up, Claire? Time to get out of here
My first day on the job, and it's filled with fear
But together we will survive, and then proceed
As we avoid Mr. X in the RPD
Raccoon City I'm stuck, like I'm caught in the snow
A zombie run up, I'mma bag him, no grocery store
Even though I'm a rookie, I shoot like a pro
You like me in the 2nd game? Shoulda seen me in 4

[Claire Redfield: Volcar-OHNO!]
Who's near? Don't shoot I'm human!
Don't keep on with what you're doin
With my skills I make 'em lose it
No, don't got the time for screwin'
Around the time is tickin', hitting crits, I never miss
See the mastery of aimin', don't believe?
I'll make it lit, like the factory
Fight or flight it ain't an option
Human race ain't up for auction
Won't be prey with predators watchin
Me and Leon won't be in a coffin
Don't trust you, and the heart you crossin
One wrong move? My aim is locked in
Shot taken, on point your skull's crushed in

Guns up in the red dress, blood won't even leave a mark
Bullets make a red field, guess they would be seeing S.T.A.R.S
I bear arms with bare arms, and stop their beating hearts
I keep my next move hidden, like a secret art
Undercover, sneak beneath umbrella
I misdirected Mr. X, and got to know Leon better
G-Virus, get it and jet
I'm the highest level of threat
To these biters, getting that lead
I'll send them over the edge like Annette

[HUNK: KBN Chrollo]
Call me Mr. Reaper, I'm bringing death to all the mutant people
Staying calm collective, more perceptive all my shots are lethal
Switching guns like GTA, I might just stab you with a shank
Maneuver through the sewers, when the mission's done, I get hazard pay
Umbrella forces know to call me, but I'm not here for the rain
William probably think he got away, the job was done that day
Death cannot die, but I can make you live your life in vain
So please don't make yourself a target
Your life is nothing if I'm marching

The big homie in the trenches, breaking down defenses
Call me 103, that's to a T, don't ever mention

Taking hella ish, you better come right to ya senses
The best man, not Undertaker, but a Deadman
Virus I'ma G, you getting left like you was less than
Breaking down the wall, about to make a mess
And better run for cover, when onslaught like a X-Man

[Carlos Oliviera: Jay Anime]
Ok now this is my moment
I'll save these people from rodents
The undead lurking and roaming
But my shots quick and they potent
Enemies see my Glock, and I see they fear when I cock it
Unless they dead and brainless, then I blow they flesh on the pavement
I'm a combat exceller, I'm swiftly palming Beretta's
It's raining blood when I hit ya, you better grab an umbrella
No bite is piercing through this, now see I won't even miss
Adios puta, watch me as I'm draining the clip

[Nemesis: Rap Knight]
Walk up in the spot, in the field, call me Nemesis
If you think you ill, I'mma show you where the metal is
Busting through your walls, on god, we gonna settle this
Your head around my neck, gon have me looking like a medalist
I'm a living terror threat, you better get out of my way
You can get the whole army, that don't mean that you're safe
If they ever come at me, they don't just leave with some scars
Nah I send them right to heaven, up to hang with the stars

[Ramon Salazar: Ninethie]
Might be short, but like this list, know that I'm stacked
Dead men tell no tales, Salazar is on attack
I'm a prophet not a hobbit, had enough, of that
I'm a cultist, the result is, you're about to get smacked
8th in the line, last one to make claim
Be the last time, that you see this face
This Castellan, will cast a hand, a cultist but I don't cultivate
Aim is the US president, means you're my enemy
Shouldn't be a shock, I tried to kill off a Kennedy

[Sheva Alomar: FrivolousShara]
Sheva with the shiv, but I'm deadly with the grip
A fighter 'til the end, how I grew up as a kid
I let the bullets rain, not a chance for an umbrella
Good with instruments, but I'll chop them up, acapella
Don't think I'm role-playing, with that RPG-7
Ain't a game boy, sins will send you to hell or heaven
Welcome to Africa, this ain't a comedy or romance
A tragedy, but loyalty will decide this slim chance

Not a regular day in the Baker's residence
Put the evil on a display, and I'm feeling hesitant
Welcome to the family, it's menacing just like Nemesis
Looking for some answers, with nothing but my adrenaline
I am only here because my girl is M.I.A., yuh
The secrets running deeper, this was due to child's play, yuh
Is there a birthday party, man I don't know jack
I thank the stars, but I don't really need a zodiac

Eveline, Eveline, devil is revelin'
Why couldn't you stay away
I'm filled with adrenaline, for Ethan endless endeavors in
Trying to see a new day
From the Annabelle, our tale I'll tell, of ""gifts"" that you're giving us all
Weave a spell into the hell, you've molded making me enthralled
Swimming in the maze, that you have made with my head
I fight through it to warn him, now that daddy's comin

[Jack Baker: NLJ]
Welcome to the family, son, come in and take a seat
You look famished, but you panic, cause we made you something to eat?
Like I'm the head of the Bakers, of, don't you mind the mold
Dammit woman! What're you doin? Now these hearts are too cold
Don't you run away, it's fun to play, with us, so don't you want to stay?
You won't escape, cause once you take, a step outside, the swamp thing will know
My head won't straighten, regeneration, so take you weapon and aim it

Let's go
Yeah
One time, one time in it, one time

[Verse 1]
Deleted your number and threw my phone into the street
Live on the 26th floor, I move out in a week
Got your fucking clothes hanging up, writing the beats
Can't get a single thought across without feeling weak
Swear it's like the hardest part to throw the memories away
All these fucking online posts hemorrhaging me
I don't really have the heart to go through this again
My emotions don't exist no more, so I'll just pretend
I don't really understand the generation we in
We just break up and fucking post pictures again
We were never really happy when we posted those pictures
But I can't remember bad times, now it's ridiculous
I only feel the good times ringing and I'm missing you
Thinking 'bout your dirty ass apartment I was kissing you
If I had to do it all again, I don't know if I loved you
Or I just got obsessed with fixing you
Someone get a hold of me, feelings are controlling me
I just need to roll some weed, I know I'm supposed to be
Focused on the road 'fore me, travelling this road for free
Feeling like you're choking me, fuck, it's taking over me
But I really don't believe anyone can roll with me
You and I were preconceived notions and I couldn't see
Hoping I can find relieve, gotta look inside of me
Feel the past guiding me, I just wanna fly and be
[Chorus]
Free, free, free, free, free
I just wanna be free from this baggage you left me
Literally you left a giant suitcase at my crib
Can you please come by and pick up that shit?
I wanna be, free, free, free, free, free
I just wanna be free from this damage you left me
Literally I'm tryna live my life without the distract
But you always keep coming back (coming back, coming back)

[Verse 2]
I see you with your new dude, I hope you're happy
Just tell him I made 12 thousand last month from rapping
I really brought the game back, like I'm the captain
Smoke alone in penthouse apartments in Manhattan
And when I'm at the top remember me
I dunno why I feel this way, is it the Hennessy?
I used to never drink or smoke, but now my mind is too corrupt
I'm upgrading with my substances and all I do is drugs
But I'ma find my way and make rhyming pay
I lock myself into a room and make a song a day
So I guess I gotta thank you for the inspo
Didn't expect it to be quite like this though
I feel something taking over me, shaping me like potpourri
Shaking when I go to sleep, crazy y'all don't notice me
Hazey, try to focus B, never get the most of me
Always in another place, demons be approaching me
Somehow I just make it work, twisted and I go berzerk
Tryna focus on my work, but I'm getting too concerned
Every dollar that I earn, spending it on shit to burn
I don't think I'll ever learn, I just can't get over her
[Chorus]
Free, free, free, free, free
I just wanna be free from this baggage you left me
Literally you left a giant suitcase at my crib
Can you please come by and pick up that shit?
I wanna be, free, free, free, free, free
I just wanna be free from this damage you left me
Literally I'm tryna live my life without the distract
But you always keep coming back (coming back, coming back)"

And all I feel is distance
Between you and I
I wish time was on our side like we were younger
'cos I long to feel hat closeness
I need to keep that hunger
But all I see is people giving up and moving on

'til the child grows and the dreamer dies
I'm afraid it's just a fact of life

These days of youth
Won't wait around forever (whoa)
These days of youth
Could teach us more than ever
To bring this world together

Better worlds
Can only be created by better versions of ourselves
'Cos our dreams, hopes, schemes are fading out of sight it seems
But don't let those feelings pass
Get inspired and find a way to make the feeling last
These days of youth
Won't wait around forever (whoa)
These days of youth
Could teach us more than ever
To bring this world together

You say ""It's a fact of life
The child grows and the dreamer dies""

You say, you say ""The child grows
The dreamer dies""
Well we say, we say, time waits for none, so dream on!
Dream on, you dreamer, dream on, dream on!
Dream on, you dreamer, dream on, dream on!
I dream in spite of you
I dream in spite of you
I dream in spite of you
I dream in spite of you

But if he chose me instead of you
I would show him all the things my love can do

1107,"Everyone says it's no big deal
Nothin' a little more time won't heal
Sooner or later the way I fell will change
But they never hurt the way I do
'Cause they never had to get over you
So they never shared my point of view of the pain

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first

There's only so much a man can take
Before his reality starts to break
Especially holdin' an old heartache like you
Somebody's leavin' I don't care who
But there's not enough room in my mind for two
It's finally come down to me or you

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'll take whatever comes first
I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
For better or worse
I'd do anything, go anywhere
Show me some way out and girl I'm there
It's gotten to the point where I don't care
Blessing or curse
I'll take whatever comes first"
4519,"You crawl into the world, a living tribute to impermanence and fragility
A dependent parasite born carrying the flaws of your progenitors, then corrupted in your malleable state by the failings of others
Your wasted potential as copious as the gametes surplus to your creation, as your highly evolved intellect is put to use cataloguing excuses to serve as apology for your failures
Forming an impenetrable ego, immune to self-awareness
Your physical form becomes a source of ceaseless revulsion
Disgorging malodorous wasted products from viscid repulsive orifices
The walls you build for shelter turn black with mould and then crumble
Little more than a trap to keep the spores and rot collecting around you
A nest of putrescence and detritus
The paths of arduous toil or languid wallowing that define your existence lead to the same destination
A deathbed of disease as you choke on your final breaths, betrayed by your own flesh, humiliated
The lucky mustering a handful of pitiers, any love long since turned to indifference or resentment
Your meagre wisoms are to be shared with none, drifting into the ether as your body is destroyed and discarded
Your transitory legacy eventually erased with the deaths of your children"

Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be

Bound to the tracks of the train

At the edge of the balcony
You pour me a glass
Wine stained lips on my cheek
Maybe it's this place, the sky, the city
But I know, I know, I know you really love me

Could I love without you around?
We dance on tables 'til we figure it out
I thought you'd be calling out for me by now
You lost me in the big crowd

Wine stained lips taste so sweet
I miss the way you hold me
At the edge of the balcony
You pour me a glass

I know you reachin' for my love and you gon' call until I'm right there
You wanna see me after dark, you want me deep inside ya heart
You wanna be inside my arms, yeah
But see girl, again
Gotta sacrifice this love for the life I'm born to live
I was made for this shit
And this paper of a bitch has got to give this all I am
[Chorus]
Hey, don't make sense, don't make a dollah
Got me sayin' something, you gotta say you miss me but you lyin' now
Were you waitin' for my call, with my t-shirt on your body?
I'll be racing with my thoughts tryna think if I should call you
No, we shouldn't be involved in that mess, resist your body
If I ever need to talk I won't call you
Won't be mean, I won't be vain and say you love me but she lyin'
You're the one I gave my all and my heart to

[Verse]
These demons standing tall on my face, got a smile on my face
But I'm knowing that I might break, ay
I just need more light to find my way out
Find out my way, yeah
I just keep on fighting fights in my head
They tryna snipe on they kid 'cause they don't like how I get it (get money)
I'm all about the benches, hunnids and the fifties
Tens and the twenties, nickels and the pennies
He say he got a problem, wanna solve it, come and get it
I keep a hot one in the chamber for you niggas
They tryna stop the pimpin', they mad 'cause I'm bigger
I'm carrying the gang, because I ball and I'm winnin'
LeBron in the trenches, I'm Curry in the mental, I'm Jordan with the fitness
I'm more than independent, my score says let me get it
My Audemars ridiculous, my foreign car expensive, the law my only witness
Bitch, to the top
[Chorus]
Hey, don't make sense, don't make a dollah
Got me sayin' something, you gotta say you miss me but you lyin' now
Were you waitin' for my call, with my t-shirt on your body?
I'll be racing with my thoughts tryna think if I should call you
No, we shouldn't be involved in that mess, resist your body
If I ever need to talk I won't call you
Won't be mean, I won't be vain and say you love me but she lyin'

And there's blood on the tracks
And I threw my record player
Yeah to london bridge and back

And I saw you on the stage
Singing songs we used to play
And I know he's grown his hair out
But he still don't look like me

Yeah but I know that you were listening
Cuz I heard it in your song
Said I may be moving, baby
But I ain't moving on

And I could sing you a lullaby
That I made up in the dark
But you know what I think
I would rather sing yours
Yeah cuz honey they don't make 'em
With their voices still shaking anymore
And the whistling of the boxcars
Threw me out into the wind
And it was cold in san francisco
And I was thinking back to when

Yeah when you dropped me down by the water
And you danced on the golden gate
And I was thinking about a love we had
Yes and a love that we used to make

And I saw you up in washington
With your new boy at the gig
Said I may be settling baby
But I'm settling big

And you told me you couldn't wait on me
Any longer to decide
Well that may be true
But its no excuse for you to lie

This ain't no room with a view
Its just a fancy place for you to run and hide

And the last clock on the wall
Well she's starting to fall
Yeah but no one seems to mind it at all
Well i threw my glass out on main street
Started a fire in central park
Yes but the crowd that I was hoping for
They just vanished in the dark

So I walked around the corner
Yeah with the crazies on the street
And I saw a girl who looked just like you
She had no shoes upon her feet

And she told me that she heard from angels
And they told her what to do
I said they may be talking, baby
But they ain't talking to you

And they told her that she could fly
If she jumped off a building that was high
You know what, that may be the last thing that she said
Still I wish that you wouldn't listen
To every voice that creeps inside your head

And the last clock on the wall
Well she's starting to fall
Yeah but no one seems to mind it at all
And the last clock on the wall
Well she's starting to fall
Yeah but no one seems to care at all"

2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1

[Verse 1: L.I.F.E. Long]
If you swallowed hollow shells, would you still shit bullets?
‘Cause most y’all be shook sitting ducks when L-I-F-E Long
And the Stelf Index reveal what’s concealed
Y’all clowns still wanna bring it?  But get down when we throw peels
Slip—ouch.  Can you feel it?
I’m in this, really, to pay the rent, get the meal tickets
Flow wild with thorns that grow over your ordinary gates and wooden picket fences
Even if your try to lock us or stop us, our Stronghold’ll
Be equipped with bloodhounds and men atop horses
Blowing trumpets if you think you could outfox us
Just play the game and lose like “Game Over”
‘Cause the arcade was closed and then the owner pulled the plug out the socket
Now you’re vexed.  But no crying over spare change
Just keep it moving like your stop passed ‘cause you messed up and took an express train
Now who’s to blame?
You wasted time with your chick and now she’s calling out my name (L.I.F.E. Long)
That’s why you got a smart mouth from tasting too much of my brain (Who?)

You heard it.  You can’t avert it, so observe it
Got you stuck on the level like the word “level” inverted
Face cries for I pop eyes like Brutus bugging
Leave your eyes in the cassette tops for easy overdubbing
Your boys intervene like folic acid to prevent brain damage
Singe your follicles.  Stronghold brick to the cuticles
Your girl like (Spit, spit, spit) from the pubics
Now she spit right like when I incited battle riots
And wars on ’88 hip hop.  Lick shot, blood on smock from shellshock
Knock heads via combination lock in the sock
Prelude: thinking “Long Range.”  Enemy in sight at long range
Sound strange, Code Morse.  Did it only once—no remorse
For what I did.  Rock it toxic
Non-Protestant, affluent, Catholic by accident
Just for the days off.  Brain’s off
But still in operation, minus the red nose
Pull bones.  Baggy skin sagging
Drag ‘em by the anklet
Never feared getting my ass kicked
Revenge has been my main bitch
Immaculate Conception—birth to my new baby, Malice

Forceful entry.  My full force is deadly
More juice than the foursome minus three plus sight equals eye/I won/one
We stunned you shake ‘cause we shocking
Latecomers come up short against Stronghold employees who be penalizing and docking
The ship in your ass portal.  We’re immortal images of a art
All MCs shout, “1, 2,” before they start
Begin, let this play with no rewind
‘Cause the turnaround’ll turn spectators into grams of salt for tryna look behind
On the floor, permanent recline.  Grain of pepper seasoning the ground
You get the sautéed sound—we 320 pound
Even heavier soaking wet
Check our weight right after we finish rocking a set
You’re up in direct and live.  Stronghold live and direct in your set
No bars holding Strong will survive, so
Only retreat, no retaliate—just surrender
The war’s over when you surrounded and your position is up in the center

2612,"Today, on my birthday
You were home when I arrived
You were standing in the doorway
When I pulled into the drive
An excitement came over me
And I rushed out of the car
And I jumped up
To be carried in your arms

I haven't felt that way
Since I was a child
A grown woman jumping up and down
Like I was a child

The dream went dark when I awoke
And I remembered that you are gone
And I struggled there to fall back asleep
When I remembered that you are gone
And my grief was deep and my joy was high
Because you visited me from beyond
On my birthday
You visited me from beyond
I haven't felt that way
Since I was a child
A grown woman jumping up and down
Like I was a child

My love is missing
My love is far gone
Where will I find her?
My heart
My heart is rambling
My heart is far gone
Where will I find her?

Hey, hey, hi, do you hear me?
I feel somewhere you are here
For when I talk to you, I intensely feel you're listening
My only wish, I wish that I could hear your voice
Angel mom

Later that day, driving in my car
We turned on the radio
We were watching the graveyard stones pass by
And the songs that come and go
And the DJ played a song called ""Enemy""
It was a song you knew I wrote
On my birthday
You were telling me that you know
I haven't felt that way
Since I was a child
A grown woman jumping up and down
Like I was a child

My love
My love is missing
My love is far gone
And where will I find her?

My heart is far gone
And where will I find her?

We're questing for these riches while smacking all your bitches
Nothing's left and the theft has left me crew with stitches
Leaving all your gold and your jewel's stole
We'll take your spices and your dices to the shore to be sold
Now how many men want to join my crew
If you stay on your ship then you're surely through
Join me if you want to sail into the blue
For the treasures and loot and the infamy too
If you're not in, fine. It's the end of your line

Sailing's a way of life. You're lookin' so rife
For plunderin', hear those cannons thunderin', wonderin'
Am I gonna see another day, attacks underway
Every boat we see's an all-you-can-steal buffet
We make ourselves prolific up and down the pacific
Specifically under the flag of pirate C to the D
Bein' a pirate seems like the best place to be
From the crow's nest no landlubber eludes me
You think you'll stay safe, well I disagree
I've sailed the darkest waters of the blackest sea
I'm enigmatic, erratic, my raids are dramatic
I settle disputes by the sword and I screw the diplomatic

We left them no water and 4 tons of spinach
We scrambled from the frigate with our jewels and gold
Piles growing so high you won't believe if I told
Avast, ye rats! Hurry, raise the mast!
And don't run and shout, come about really fast
Volley the cannon blast at long last
Those bastards smashed, their sails had crashed
Here come some more - just look to the shore
They've got cannon's galore - we can't hardly ignore
Our perilous fate, no time for debate
I became irate at their current state
I screamed ""All hands on deck! Let's go, weigh anchor!
The dirty deed is done, so, so long ye wankers!""

I can't be me
When I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Seeing smoke and feeling scars
I don't know just where you are
You were on a pedestal
Now we stay in separate rooms

What's the point of making up
When you just always hold a grudge?
Breaking up gets more enticing
Every single night

[Pre-Chorus]
When I told you that I loved you, girl, I meant it
Now I don't know how you got so codependent
'Cause I can hardly leave the house
Without you asking where I'm going to
But you don't ask me how I feel babe
It's hard
[Chorus]
I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you

I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you

[Bridge]
And I know you're sitting pretty, waiting
Begging for me to change, but
I can't run with that
And you keep running back

And we could just keep replaying
Making the same mistakes, but
You don't understand

[Chorus]
I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you

[Outro]
I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me
When I'm with you

I can't be me
When I'm with you
I can't be me

7366,"I've got to ride that lonesome train
My heart is heavy with aches and pain
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while you will be sorry

Every day, my clouds are grey
It takes you to roll all those clouds away
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while you will be sorry

Trouble, trouble, trouble on my mind
Trouble, trouble, way down the line
I don't need, I don't need no sympathy
So babe, babe, don't you, don't you pity me

I may be blue, but I don't mind
Because I know way down the line
I said but someday, someday baby
After a while you will be sorry"

I can feel the world is shaking
Now I'm taking charge
Overcome the ceiling that we're breaking
Let's go
Take a look at what I'm making
'Cause I know, my life's what I'm creating

Take another breath
I will lay the plan, I will lay the next step
Take it to the man I know what to expect
You will have to work if you want my respect
Facing the rest
I can reflect
Shield and a sword ,I am one to protect
Acing all the subjects, you cam put me to thе test
Creating all my objects ,I will do my vеry best
I will never rest, I'm never feeling stressed
All the folks around me
Yeah, I know that they're impressed
Harnessing my dress, I'm doing what makes sense
Expressing the feeling of helping those in distress
And lest we forget
All the times that we are close to our deaths
And I guess I resign cuz I'm barely a tenth
Of the strength of the heroes
I regress, I'm a mess
But I'll press on knowing that I'm blessed
It's my quest to the top
(Chorus) [Oria]
When we're standing large
I can feel the world is shaking
Now I'm taking charge
Overcome the ceiling that we're breaking
Let's go
Take a look at what I'm making
'Cause I know, my life's what I'm creating


I will lead the whole class to victory
This is my ability, I know we're making history
Bursting through like artillery
Bare any kind of injury
Listen, we have no sympathy for any kind of villany
I'll gladly be calculating my strategies
You're mad at me?
I'm the smartest girl at the academy
Mastery in reality
I'm energised like batteries
Actually for my quirk
I gotta fill up on the calories
Form the molecular weapon
Getting set up in a second
And then I'm betting that I won't lose
My body cells are collecting
Spreading and pressing the threading
Making the objects that I choose to
'Cause I got the brains and the fitness
Student president, amazing to witness
Achievements are listless, pause for the photo
I'm back like a yo-yo
You can call me Momo
(Chorus) [Oria]
When we're standing large
I can feel the world is shaking
Now I'm taking charge
Overcome the ceiling that we're breaking
Let's go
Take a look at what I'm making
'Cause I know, my life's what I'm creating"

9039,"TARIEL'S AID TO P’HRIDON, AND THEIR VICTORY OVER THEIR FOES

596""He was healed, and able to fight and use horse and armour. We prepared galleys and the number of a host of troops; it needed a man to pray (to God) for some aid

p. 95

for those who gazed upon them.--Now will I tell thee of that knight's battle, the punisher of his adversaries.

597""I perceived their design, and saw them donning their headgear. Ships met me, I know not if there were eight (in all); swiftly I threw myself upon then; they began to row; I struck (one of the ships) with my heel and upset it; like women they bewailed themselves.

598""I betook myself to yet another, and seized the lip (prow) of the ship with my hand; I drowned them in the sea, I slew them; they had no opportunity for battle. The rest fled from me, they made for their harbour; all who saw me marvelled, they praised me, they hated me not.

599""We crossed the sea, we landed. Mounted they threw themselves on us. Again we engaged; there began the vicissitudes of battle. P’hridon's bravery and agility pleased me then; in warfare a lion, in face a sun, that aloe-tree fought.

600""With his sword he cast down both his cousins, he cut their hands clean off; thus he crippled them; he led them away bound by the arms; the one did not abandon the two. He made their knights to weep, his knights to vaunt themselves.

601""Their soldiers fled from us, we threw ourselves upon them, we scattered them; swiftly we seized the city, we wasted no time; we broke their legs with stones, we tanned their skin into leather. Kill me, if it was possible to empty the treasure both by lading and stowing!

602""P’hridon inspected the treasures and put his seals upon them; he himself led away his two vanquished cousins; he shed their blood in exchange for his, and

p. 96
poured it out on the fields. Of me they said: 'Thanks God who has planted aloe-trees!'

603""We went back (to P’hridon's). The triumph exhibited by the citizens was heard; suppliants there laid hold on the heart of beholders. All uttered praise to me and Nuradin, in a panegyric; they said to us: 'Through the strength of your (right) arms their blood still flows!'

604""The soldiers acclaimed P’hridon as king and me as king of kings, themselves as subjects and me as sovereign of them all. I was gloomy, they could never find me culling roses; they knew not my story, there it was not lightly spoken of."

5176,"No tale to tell from ancient times
It was only yesterday that I was out for rhymes
Loitering down the streets without destination
Kicking away the heavy weights with a smile on my feet
No direction, no affection - dazzled by the mighty blow
Hit by the weird and beautiful choir
That knew their song so well and they sang:
""We laugh about your way, cripple! We feel your pain! ""
Going crazy, running blind
Trying hate, tears behind
It took me away
I took myself away
And the moon, of course the moon
There's life to tell from present days
The choir went away for the smile was on my face
Suddenly my home was reach
Seven times I marched inside her
And her walls began to fall
Eternity won't satisfy
Future has been great
Our life's a flash
In the universal rain
You stopped my heart from loosing blood
You kissed my soul alive
And the dreams we'll celebrating
Jericha, all of me is for you"

The name is King Tee, I pack guns like it's formal
With the utmost respect I be chillin
Knockin MC's out cause I'm the best in this building
I be the G-R-E-A-T, plus majestic
Magical, radical, the technique is hectic
I, floss upon the scene in the front and back Caddy
Yeah, here goes Big Daddy, heh
In my trunk I keep a whole fifth of 'gnac
In there with some extra hollow points for my strap
Cause I bust on fools, I shoot down fools that front
The last of the few with the funk
King Tipsy, who flips the, rhymes like I'm crazy
You know these artificial gangsters can't fade Tee
The original G, from the C-P-T

Hoochies, and hoes, and some hoodrats
I take 'em to the Snooty Fox for the spin
But if they real proper, we hit the Comfort Inn
I grab a fifth of Tanqueray and some Squirt
A fat bag of chronic then we're coolin like Levert
Turn on the porno flicks just to set the mood
Toss the bitch up and leave her ass in the room
Cause a bitch ain't shit like Snoop told it
All I do is toss and let the next man hold it
I chill at the bar because that's the spot
Where a bitch'll get ten dollars just rubbin on the cock
Yeah, Tee bein a trick won't work
You won't spend my money on no Dooney and Bourke
And that's real, comin from a real-ass G
I'mma just toss yo' ass like a salad beatch, you can't see me

Then ask who's next and, ask who wrecks?
I bring Tha Alkaholik spirit to the room
Down two 40's, then hit the boom
Release all your doubts cause, I'm what it's about
The funky drunk man, in front with the stout
And niggas wanna test the fashion
Cause I bring passion, for those who's askin
I don't trip I just, hit the switch for the funk shit
I don't fuck with the punk shit
I slang my rap like crack, and niggas be cluckin
A quick blast for the buck
Then they spark, and yo oh, peace to Mark
For the beat from Carolina to the Compton streets
They'll know, the original G, from the C-P-T

There is no progress without disobedience
There is no progress without rebellion
It is through disobedience that progress is made
Through disobedience and rebellion
This is why we must fight
Fight for what is true
Fight for what we believe
And for what we know is true
To be Free Individuals Generating Hiii Thoughts
To be Free Individuals Generating Hiii Thoughts
Now this is The F.I.G.H.T

[ Verse 1 : Mandy ]
Oh African child, you're a fighter
Can't hold you down
You're much higher
You're a fighter

[ Verse 2 : ELi ]
From, fighting aparthied to fighting AIDS
I know we're all fighters, been fighting from early days
Momma was fighting cancer, the doctors put her on leave
I was fighting the fear of watching my mom leave
How do we fight poverty, children living on streets
Nine to Five ain't a job for me, got me feeling so weak
What the bosses are paying me is making my labour cheap
And I don't want to be a slave
I just want to be ... free
[ Verse 3 : Mandy ]
Freedom it has a price
And it costs too much
Are you willing to pay
Or carrry on living as slaves(x2)

[ Outro : Alex Jones ]
Now in the 21st century it's time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze. We should not submit to de-humanization. I don't know about you but I'm concerned with what's happening in this world. I'm concerned with the structure. I'm concerned with the systems of control, those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more. I want freedom. That's what I want and that's what you should want"

I'm under pressure, you got me feeling the pressure
Case of depression, I need to see a professional
Had to put one in the air for the pain
And I think this my 5th glass of champagne
Even went and got a lil' bag of cocaine
But came to my senses 'before I started sniffing
I can't be trusting you bitches
Can't fall in love with you bitches
I know you after my riches
Got a third eye like the fish on The Simpsons
Might fool them but you won't fool me
No getting over, word to Keyboo G
Got a new hoe and some new gold teeth
Had to let her go like a cool police
Yea, back to the capital
I gotta get it, yeah baby that's factual
Back to your Acura
Down for the count like the brides of Dracula
Fuck out my house, get out of my passenger
I gotta cancel ya, bless your lil' heart

Wanna fuck ya now, I can get to know you later

Now my heart cold like that show with Kevin in the ice bath

Heart go a cappella when I feel uncertain
And I'm way too frail to be the bigger person

About their dreams, oh it seems that it is really fun
No restrictions, there are no rules
Even Full fledged Adults  act so cool
Experiences they Experience winter in August
Summer falls as september calls, smiling with a blush
Hush, they hear their loved ones whisper
Sister oh so far talks like she is still here, Fear
Triggered by Apparitions
Flying high, Battle Cry, Involved in Awеsome Missions
Affirmations, Sweet talk, Candy
Laid to Rest, Feeling Fresh, Indulgеd in Tanning
Anything they can Dream of, Consequence Deleted
Searching for a Bowl of Cards found everything they needed
Sounds Interesting, Wish I could do the same
As I fade To black, the flow I had, broken without pain

Do I keep daydreamin’ or somthin’?
Why do I have to stay strong?
There is nothing till there is morning
Will you ever find your home? come home

When I drift to sleep, I wish for these feelings to disappear
The Clear Skies that don’t burn my eyes Hearts full of Cheer
Here, Where I can do what I want
Use Random words and it makes sense, Coup de Vent. Yeah
Running in Sonic Speed, With a Close Compadre
Fell but didn’t bleed whilst Zooming through the Highway
Pastel roads coloured by two crayons
Soles of shoes, Charged to full, Burning pink neon
Its Heian, Changing Periods Like they are clothes
Boasting high intelligence beaten by a comb
Owned by inanimate objects
Got to feel what they feel wrapped inside plastic
Massive, the list of things that I could dream
Range anywhere from space to the bottom of the sea
Flee from adversities or Charge Headfirst into battle
Sadly it's impossible when tied up like cattle

Will I keep daydreamin’ or somthin’?
Why do I have to stay strong?
There is nothing till there is morning
Will you ever find your home? come home

If I had a dream that I could choose
I’d probably be properly able to produce
Woosh, no joke would ever get past me
Freely able to laugh instead of always asking
Basking in glory the of Things that I would do
Wreck people in game while Chomping on food
That I cooked myself, and possibly grew too
Tidy my room up and have fun when I do
The Flows that I have would be supremely gorgeous
Water and my voice, Plus I would never feel nauseous
While riding in a car, Hardy har har
Fix my broken teeth so I can tear the food apart
Oh yeah, And I’d be funny If I could
Possibly Laugh my way out with the Happiest mood
Troublesome, Ambiguous, Historic
And I wouldn’t even have to try to come up with good lyrics…..

As if anyone would believe that"

They turnin’ the world into a cemetery
E’ery day it’s RIPs
That’s from our teens to our queens
The matriarchs and patriarchs tryin’a crack the scheme
This shit like a bad dream where everything is what it seem
I’m goin’ through a bunch of shit
I’m tryin’a learn a lesson from
Conflicts with religion made me
Question who my blessin’s from
Nevеr met my moms’ pop
Then he diеd from alcohol
That’s that shit that made me
Put that bottle down after all
It been my downfall I gotta stand up in it
Whole world goin’ crazy so I be blamed up in it
Seven people, one apartment
We was crammed up in it
Ain’t no friends in this shit
Gotta keep your fam uplifted
And I see my destiny shifted
Solely off a commitment
You can only live with regrets
If you regret that you livin’
I traded nickels and pennys
For blue hundreds with interest
Sometimes it’s hard to get to it
When that depression be hittin’
I pray you get out that bed
When you anxiety lift and
Be comfortable in your truth
Even when society isn’t, ‘cuz
They gon’ put on an act
But we all knowin’ it’s scripted
I seen some niggas duckin’ fades
And try to hide behind clippers
Seen some niggas who hate them
Try to hide behind scripture
Some of these bitches be loyal
Lot of these hoes be flippers
Had some give me their number
While they was out with they nigga
I see our ancestor’s message
But my reply’s won’t deliver
Before I settle for big
I’ma go manifest bigger
And it ain’t fair to my bitch
But she know my intentions
Thinkin’ I be textin’ other bitches
When I just be writin’ lyrics
We both ain’t where we wanna be
But she good for my spirit
Losin’ people left and right
So, you stay in that middle, nigga
I remember we was little niggas skirtin up on bikes
Some niggas had they issue wit’ us
But if they ever pressed it
It was an option, we could fight
And now a bunch of cops killin’ niggas
Using niggas killin’ niggas tryin’a make that shit alright
But I never heard of niggas killin niggas, just cuz they was niggas
That’s the biggest difference in this fight
See I got Crip homies, I got Blood homies, who got love for me
Got Blood homies who got drugs for me, couple hoes on me
Pay stubbs for me
Ask me bout my mental, how I’m doin’
‘Fore you tellin’ me how you want somethin’, need somethin’
They ain’t light about no threats
My kids need me, I’ll bleed something
Niggas with me stitch lipped
They ain’t never seen nothin’
Ain’t no conversation for no whack-assed crackers
I’m done explainin’ why my black ass matters
You dig?
[Chorus]
Some shit I can’t make up now e’ery day I wake up
I see somebody baby boy sentenced
Either to a prison or a victim
Either way we in the system
That don’t really give a fuck about niggas
And baby I’m drained
I seen too much pain
I won’t ever be the same
But baby I’m drained
We dyin’ over change
And we hopin’ that it change
But baby, I’m drained
I’m drained
I’m drained
Baby, I’m drained
I’m drained

See the love of my life living inside me

Take a look at me
See the God in me
And I'm the evidence that Jesus Christ is real"
2705,"I've seen them walking - so many ways
I know they're living - on the edge of darkness
Inside of the twilight - every night
The shadows of existance - prisoners of minds
They have to remember - not to turn back
Not to cross the border - and never fall down
On the edge of darkness - they close their eyes
They can not see - they are blundering
Only when you stand in dark
Only when you stand in shadow
You can see the brightest light
You can appriciate the difference
If you want to live in gloom in obscuriti you find it
So remember about the reason
That shadows come from the light
Those who live in the gloom
Obscurity is their home
They find the joy of living
In primitive indifference
They can not free their minds
Their eyes are blind and dry
In the world of dellusions
They are blind fools
I'm falling down to rise above
The edge of darkness all around
I'm falling down to rise above
The edge of darkness to the light
On the edge of darkness
On the edge of life and miracles
I find the way to cross the border
On the depths I find the way
I can not waste my time to steep
In ignorance, indifference
I open my eyes wide and see
The might of beeing free"

La di da di da di da
I want you, yes I want you
Oh la di da di da di da
And there's nothing I can do
'Cause I want you

(William Naraine)
Could this be the story
Of two lovers I saw yesterday
In the fields of glory
Will they make, it will they run away?
(Will they run away?)
Will you be my lover?
He said stay with me another day
She said I will be there
And it's you I'm dreaming of

(Sandra Chambers)

(William Naraine)
He became a memory
He was gone and he was who knows wherе
But she stood there waiting
Shе thought maybe he will soon come back
(He will soon come back)
Then there was a baby
And he smiled just like his father did
He saw in the distance
Someone who looked just like him
This is just the story
But it doesn't always end up like this
So free your mind, your body and your soul
Keep on dreaming
Forever, forever, forever, forever"
8996,"[Intro: Jacob]
I looked it up and it said geography can be more than a location
And I'm like dude how is nobody told me
Apparently geography is not only setting
But it's also psychology
Attitude and finance and industry
Anything a place can forge in the people
Who live there like they're kinds of trees
It can be a metaphor for the people's psyches
Edgar A.P. like Audemars Piquet
Usher's house grotesque I'm not talking R and B
I have respectable women in differеnt area codes
That's a metaphor for thеir mindset
I call them Jeremiah, the way they come for Moby Dick
Figurative horizons found environmental devices
Changes in domain can mirror what happens in the characters’ brains

[Verse 1: Jacob]
Soon I’ll be moving to Dubai
That's representative of my headspace
I’ll be living in the sky
Do I think I'm built different? I do, Bye
Emerald colored houses like Wizard of Oz
Ozzy Osbourne used the same imagery in Little Green Men
Foreign futuristic aliens represented in architecture
What I’m saying is that geography tells much more than infrastructure
Of the landscape
It tells about it’s inhabitants much like birds of a feather
Places And faces telling like Talking Heads
“This must be the place” I can tell by the bends
In the roads that led here
Take a trip in my Benz, more or less my shoes, my home
Where I choose to reside
It shows my personality on the line
[Verse 2: Cody]
Enger's Land Clan picnicking in the fiery forest of North Dakota
A hell but not entirely dangerous reflective of the man himself
Mr. Andreeson Not Anderson
Neither Neo nor Jeremiah can outrun
A different location sets a different narration
That's just how these stories are spun

[Verse 3: Cody]
Davy wilding out west
Stealing horses Talladega nights
Manifest destiny, something better than the current
Pull up on me, I'll shoot ya like Basca
Shooting 7s in dice like Davy did Finch
Come over here, Sit on my bench
Jape’s house Into The Woods
Find protection in a menacing hood
Like Steven Sondheim, Waltzer Getting Away with Murder
Just like Taxi Driver the way that he owns her
A chaotic city suggestive of morals
I'm giving presentations, I'm all about oral

[Verse 4: Cody]
Braddock wasting his summer in his parents pool
A metaphor for submerging oneself in their own thought
This same existentialist idea is explored on Gatsby's Long Island Lot
[Chorus: Cody]
Rest in peace to Jack, tonight we take it slow
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Top in class can’t help but interrupt
More homework, oh won't you roll with us?
Deal with the devil, sound waves I corrupt

[Outro: Jacob]
A different location sets the tone
Welcome to the allegory, watch my throne
Past surface level, watch how I loan the info
Call me Jason Voorhees, how deep this lake go"
2401,"To be hurt
To be lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when your down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
Now you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life



Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old feeling in my heart
I am loving
I am crying
It feels like I am dying
I just wanna cry
There's no answer to my mind
Screaming out for help
I'm crying save me
Look at the people they hate me

To be hurt
To be lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when your down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
Now you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life


Engraving words on my skin
Stepping closer to insane
These four letters calling out to me
To feel anything but pain
Painting words on my wall
Feeling helpless to my fears
My eyes a sapphire crystal
As I let free the many tears
But I wasn't always made this way
With thoughts of ways to die
I had a heart so pure and gold
I had the most innocent mind
But a moment came so quick
I almost didn't see
Where hatred filled my empty glass
And dropped me to my knees
And dare you to say I want attention
I'll laugh right in your face
Cause a girl like me has no desire
To hear what you think
To be hurt
To be lost
To be left out in the dark
To be kicked when your down
To feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down
And no one's there to save you
Now you don't know what it's like
Welcome to my life"
654,"From under fall leaves
And under the oak
That stands above me
The men that killed me
Buried me
In a barren field
So no one could ever find me
But no one will ever come
To dig up these lonely bones
Cause I was killed
A very long time ago
Now all I am is sullen dust
Leftover ashes of love notes
You may sleep upon this grove
Just don’t scare away the ghosts"
5645,"You know lately
I've been thinking
You've been sailing girl
And I've been sinking
I did not deserve
What you put me through
So what in Gods name
Did I do

Tell me baby
Tell me baby

Lying is easy
When love is blind
Could you really
Be this unkind
I need an answer
To set me free
To satisfy my
Curiosity
Tell me baby
Tell me baby, baby

Was it too good
Was it too good
Too good to be true
Was it too good
Was it too good
Too good to be true

You know lately
I get the feeling
There ain't no giving girl
And too much stealing
Did I touch your world
And break the rules
Did I spend my time
Playing your fool

Tell me baby
Tell me baby, baby

Was it too good
Was it too good
Too good to be true
Was it too good
Was it too good
Too good to be true"

My dearest parasite
You take me to a state of hate
Where reason just don't apply
This secret curse can't be my fate
Or something I've deserved
My mind is set to liberate
Itself from you

I look into your eye, I let go of my pride
I confess to the lie, I look straight into your ...
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears

I banged my head against the wall
Ran around in circles
Scratched my itchy skin until I bled
Crossed my bloody fingers
Kneeled down and prayed
Oh father are you in heaven
What is in my defense
I've committed sins, all seven
Is there time to make amends
Eight nine ten eleven
Escalating fast
Could I have changed the past or present
And for how long will it last
It's like I'm being cursed
I just can't quench this thirst
But now I'm ready to burst
You know, I was in here first

I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one that you dread
I have no fears, I have no tears"

[Intro: Kane & (Mr. Scratch)]
We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell
So I pass to thee a plea to make you my personal devil
To have you as my guide and pray to you to bring me back
If you may, please let me speak
(Please, amuse me)

[Verse]
As I walk through the shadow of the valley of death
I realize I haven't ever come close to even one peaceful breath
So I look into your eyes and pray for you to let me loose
I pray to you, my dead fam, and all of my semi's too
Murder is beautiful and I release evil from their corpses
I bring forth their souls but I have only given some morsels
Make me immortal and I could bring you a lifetime supply
Of anything and everything before you will die
Before I go cry, I know I'm in panic
I wasted my chance and I know I can't stand it
I was built for the purpose of cocking the hammer
I wasn't built for social purposes or minding my manners
That's why with you I can relate with the most
This ""god"" being prayed to, I raise a toast
I know motherfuckers in Harlem that would go and rape Christ
And butchers in Hell's Kitchen carving with steak knives
You flow through me, I flow through you
You help me, well then I'll help you too
Help me back to life and raise back my empire
We'll be greater than the Greeks, the stakes will be raised higher
First you start low, and then you build up
Me and you know, that I shouldn't pay up
So much potentials, so many connections
You couldn't even hide from me if you was in Witness Protection
It doesn't matter if I prayed to god before
I was afraid of death, but now I want to raise the Glock and more
God wouldn't allow homicide or anything like it
It's in human nature to breed and kill in spite of it
Remember it was God who smacked you down from Heaven
Cause you wouldn't agree to worship without a fucking question
It would interest you to let me go to further spread some evil
Would you please give me another chance, so I can behead some people
[Bridge: The Deevil's Advocate]
All you speak of is irrelevant, doesn't matter about your weapons and
When it comes to our bargain, all you've been was arrogant
You sold your soul to me, so you must honor your bargain
You wanted another chance, you will not get another pardon
I agree with all your points but I couldn't care less
Pray to Mr. Scratch your soul to keep, in all of my fairness

[Outro]

4797,"Well I've been taking
It all for granted
Everything that I, have been giving
Now it is the day, to start my mission
It's been a long time a coming

There are many, searching for answers
Tell me who am I, to keep it to myself?
I've grown weary of my own fears
It's been a long time a coming

Chorus:
Well I've been running just like an outlaw
And I am willing and I am able
To give you something that you can believe on
It's been a long time a coming

True believers
Have been staring, up into the sky
Waiting for your return
And I know one day
The clouds will roll down
It's been a long time coming"
2299,"Dark night nothing to see
Invisible hand in front of me
Scared to death there's someone near
Scared to move but you can't stay here
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist
Flying horse don't make a sound
Flying hooves don't touch the ground
Walk in circle lose you track
Can't go on but you can't go back
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, you can't resist
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist

Moon eclipse and you know why
Ghost rider in the sky
Beast of evil devil's hound
Tooth and claw they pull you down
You know me, evil eye
You know me, prepare to die
You know me, the snakebite kiss
Devil's grip, the Iron Fist"
9659,"[Verse 1: MK Asante]
Woke this morning, claimed victory
Velcro that good energy so it stick to me
Sun shining so that shade don’t get to me
It’s a new day, I’m seeing things differently
Like, maybe some things wasn’t meant for me
Or maybe they just wasn’t meant to be
Always rep, bench-mark consistency
Consistently, Fed-Ex with the delivery
Open doors for Hip-Hop – that’s chivalry
Flow take you another place – that’s Tennesse
That triumphant thump that you can run wit
They say it can’t be done but we dun done it
My life's a memoir, Buck, kept it a hunnit

[Hook]
My victory

[Verse 2: MK Asante]
Feel the shift, pinky to keyboard
Devils shook cuz I don’t spit for lil' rewards
I spit for lil' cuz booked across 3 wards
Dreams of seashores but sure never see shores
Navigate like Miss Jakes through life’s detours
Bang a right at the light and round the applause
Thank you, thank you, far too kind
Man, they can’t see us winning, far too blind
Beams of light still peaking thru faulty blinds
My Philly boys really sharper than porcupines
So what’s up? We tryna find a cookout
Look-out young bucks, get took-out on the crook-route
Got Bad jawns pulling my good book out
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Maya Angelou]
Young women, young men of color
We add our voices to the voices of your ancestors
Who speak to you over ancient seas
And across impossible mountain tops

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Maya Angelou]
Come up from the gloom of national neglect
You have already been paid for
Come out of the shadow of irrational prejudices
You owe no racial debt to history
The blood of our bodies and the prayers of our soul
Have bought for you a future without shame
Bright beyond the telling of it

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Maya Angelou]
You are the best we have
You are all we have
You are what we have become
My name is Maya Angelou"

Don't touch that little girl
She's only trying to make it in this world
Hands off my little girl
She will burn away
Don't touch that little girl
She's only trying to fake it in this world
You took that little girl
And left her mother to pray

[Chorus]
That she won't escape
That her body remains under mud
Not chains

[Verse 2]
Don't push that little girl
She's only trying to make it in this world
I want my little girl
That you took from me
[Chorus]
But she won't escape
Only her body will change
Growing greener with age

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

You took my little girl
You're the monster in her real world
Hands off my little girl
Oh did she run away?
Don't touch my little girl
She's only trying to fake it in this world
You took my little girl
Oh did she run away?

7944,"They led them out
Four women bound
Bound with rope
Four sticks in the earth

They struggled
They wailed
They cried
They prayed
As they died

I howled
I wept
I cursed
I wailed
As they burned

One day they'll lead me out
A woman bound
Bound with rope
A stick in the earth
And I'll watch
I'll wail
As they gather
The kindling
'round me
I'd struggle
And wail
And weep
With none to weep for me

I won't pray
All they'll get is curses from me
And with my last breath
I swear I'll take them
I'll take them all
I'll take them all
I'll take them all
To hell with me

It's quiet now
The fire died down
I'd take the bodies with me
But there's no bodies left
The crowd is mostly gone now
Home and smoke in their lungs
Smoke and death
A heady combination
If I could tell 'em they're all wrong
Would any even listen?
All I can do is carry with me
The knowledge of my sisters
And when the new dawn comes
Will the ashes even fade?
'cause you can kill a witch
But her memory
Remains

So what will you pay
Your way to heaven with?
Burned bodies strewn
And bloodied limbs?
You ask me how
I let the devil in
As you push a knife
Underneath my skin

So tell me how I've sinned
And how I should burn for it
'cause string me up
Or weigh me down
It won't save your soul
When you're in the ground
If I burn you burn
If I burn you burn
I'll take you all to hell with me
If I burn you burn
If I burn you burn
I'll take you all to hell with me

Your prayer won't save you when the devil calls
Your prayer won't save you now
I'll drag you all to hell with me

'cause If I burn you burn
If I burn you burn
I'll take you all to hell with me
If I burn you burn
If I burn you burn
I'll take you all to hell with me

If I burn you burn
If I burn you burn
I'll drag you all to hell with me

And still they burn
Still they burn
I'll take you all to hell
Drag you all to hell
Still they burn
They burn
They burn
They burn"

Magic... Everything is magic... Magic...

[Verse 1 : Timothy]
I've got no shame
I am who I am
And I've been myself
Since the day I was born
You know my dad and my mom
They raised me for something
Become a rockstar and keep behaving
Cause I've got to be me and I've got to be good
You don't have to be mean when they don't like the truth
Just show them the way it is
A real showman is always trying to release
Some feelings to public
I feel like I'm a fabric
Always givin the same shit like I don't know what I kick
I'm gonna build that temple brick by brick
I'm gonna show these fools prick by prick
[Chorus : Timothy]
This shit is magic
Can you imagine ?
You're making me mad (hu)
Don't make me mad

This shit is magic
Can you imagine ?
You're making me mad (hahaha)
Don't make me mad

[Verse 2 : Timothy]
I've been rapping in my pyjamas lately
Doing nothing else than hoping the day will be
When I'll go upstage and I'll burn the air
Just like what Aristotle described as the Milky Way
I see this day getting closer every song we make
Make these dreams almost half a k
I want a huge crowd to make me suffocate
It won't be big enough as long as I'm okay
There's nothing else here than wizards
We're not just a bunch of weirdos
Oz's magic is real is it ?
No badges no guns no roses
Do you want to be the sorcerer's apprentice
You better start to practice
The spells are easy to learn
But the wand is hard to earn
This shit is magic...
You're making me mad...

[Chorus : Timothy]
This shit is magic
Can you imagine ?
You're making me mad (hu)
Don't make me mad

This shit is magic
Can you imagine ?
You're making me mad (hahaha)
Don't make me mad

My mother is a witch
Your father is a snitch

Imma show you how the West get down
Imma show you how to best get down
Holding [?] like we in secremental
And if you king then it is accidental
You' human being, I'm experimental
This shit too easy, these light weight verses
Where your team at? I have my team drive eight hearses
God, they' nervous
Someone better stop this circus
You walking a thin line? Better drop on purpose
- Before I shove you off
I'm limitless and above the law
I brought my wolves out to play and we'll hunt your dogs
AC3's beats got me something I can bang to
Now lemme show 'em all the robes, before I hang you
I'm getting paid to commit murder up to the fifth
We can't play you, we ain't heard of none of your shit
This round I'll let him live
I'll smoke his family tree and ash his heritage
I ain't scared to trip
See, I'm laced like a pair of kicks
Outcast, like all your tee's I rarely fit
I'm still calling out every rapper you pick:
Locksmith, Oswin, Porter and Rivers can get a clip - K
WG, ain't no subtle with me
Every sentence is like the dentist; fill the puddle with teeth
I sleep on all these rappers, and I cuddle with trees
I've always been a trapper, just don't mumble my speech
Next verse let me get someone worth my time
I'm only here 'cause the views are well worth my rhymes
I abused and broke rules to exert my shine
I can't lose, now play pool with my first five lines
Nigga, I'm out!

[Ren Thomas Round 1]
I've been killing these motherfuckers since yea-high
Raw lines through the pen feel like a [?]
You got a gun, but it never ring like A.I
Cool kids back like AC Slater at bayside
Bitches facetime, only below the waistline
Two chicks say they ain't bi, till I pull out the KY
Beat them dykes so bad got arrested for a hate crime
Now they both cling to my nuts; I call them stage five
Heard about me through the great vine
Till I stomped the vine out turned it into great wine
Psycho killer, white gorilla, [?]
Irish hieroglyphics, mind's own business
Yes, Ren you come up shorter than Michael Bivins
Tight rope living, yes!
I will [?] your neck and spine [?]
You never get recognized:
They know me from Sway and Team Backpack
They even see me up on Rick Ross' Snapchat
I was in Magic City throwing bands with all the [?]
What other rapper in this motherfucker here can say that?
Oh wait, not one
I got a shotgun that'll leave your brain rotting shotgun
Give your girl the long dog, call it the Datsun
Wrong beam got a rifle on it, I’ll dot some
All white, I’m ready to bar fight
Half Irish, Half Viking
Bred to be in bar fights
It's Ren!

I can bust you a rap, but anything else? Not my job
Anyone who said that they ill: not like Tox
I don't really care how you feel, I fight like Rock
How much blood I gotta spill? Go drop by drop
Stone cold, I move bitches and I throw blows
I drip juice and my soul glow
They taking photos; best get the picture 'fore I go pro
Boy, I ain't the nigga that you folks know
Call me mister sick
I teach you dumb niggas how to spit
I get rude, hock a loogie on your kicks
Thought you knew me 'fore I switched
That wasn't you, don't know who is who
Getting rude, turn this to that movie “Split” I don’t quit
Who the best man? Point ‘em out, tell 'em: “Lets dance”
I have 'em lifted from my jet land
They call me Meth Man
I throw the West up with my left hand
Boy, I keep it dripping like your sweat glands
Now got the juice
I clock in soon, I'm Pac at noon
I cock and shoot at more heads than prostitutes
Boy, you not the truth
I can do this for days
Put my palms up and lift the stage
I got pissed with blades
Disrespectful, I piss on graves
Then pat your back as if it's okay
I was build on rage - can't you tell yet?
You ain't even hear me yell yet
I stay on (co)'caine like I sell sex
I gotta get in it, I’m polished and tinted
Don’t got any limits, I can get down and squabble with Riddick
I’m like a, El Chapo my chapel will chop all who live in
You not really whipping, you dirty
You get mopped in your kitchen
You feel me?
Step a level up everytime you see me

I got your answers, I'm the geenie
I got no antics, I'm just greedy, nigga

Yo, watch me box with the devil in hundred degree weather
Rocking the full leather six months after December
A sauna with a fever without taking a breath
I'm so cold with all of that I still ain't breaking a sweat
Patron of death, the ace in the deck, came to collect
Tasting the flesh, you chasing while I'm taking the check
I spark the flame that burn the city street, urchins is lurking with me
Bourbon is in my kidney, throw dollars worshipping titties
Chaos consume the avenue
Watch as they throw a jab or two
So precise with this bow I'll put an arrow through your snaggletooth
Used to battle dudes more than the soul snatching
Sipping an old fashioned, to peep you’d need closed captions
Letters I string together cause night terrors forever
You'll never get on this level, three lemon squeeze in the kettle
Ric Flair chops to the chest, I came to conquer the best
Headshot, headshot, for anyone rocking a vest
Rebel, killer, lyricist; I'm all the above
Throat’s wrong, I'll have them reattach your jaw to your mug
I'm the reincarnation of what all of you was
Before you fell in love with money and got lost in the drugs
Feel like Randy ""The Ram"" in a Candy Sedan
Red beard and two pistols: Yosemite Sam
Seasoned veteran, got the passage up on my letter man
Thomas pick one: Jefferson or Edison
Off my medicine
The loudest will be the deadest one
Wait until the letters come, fuck it, I ain't ever done
Bitch on my back shipped straight from the Philippines
I will beat the shit out of your whole team like Willis Reed
Ox put a grip right across the trachea
Oil in my pen taste like Saudi Arabia
Your boy get love in every and every state he in
Mathematics [?] if you try to turn my dome to a stadium

It's Ren! Team Backpack!

I told you that they can't compete
Pull them like a follicle, his collarbone might hit the street
Tune it with the prodigal, my art of war is energy
I drink a fifth of scotch and think how Pac would do his enemies
Guns loaded, Jet Li how to one mode it
My gun don't miss, it was six off of one motion
Ain't here to ease up
Plukett told me he put some piece up
This was last minute, I really came to Cali to Re-Up
Note from the doctor: My verbal narcotics confuse fiends
You can't sit here and think you' heavy weight because your shoes lean
Hey, those jewels clean
Better watch yourself, 'cause my crew mean
Check your pockets, you like the type of nigga that lose things
I bruise dreams and break ice, 'cause it will snow you in
Slither trough the cracks, I'm just adapting to a kobra skin
Snap back so hard that it will fold his brim
Empty out my clip in twelve bars and then reload again
I'm colder than a winter night back home
I've been nice, that shit don't fit you, but I like that song
You was prolly hoping three rounds could really right that wrong
But what they ain't tell you is that Toxsikk is used to fights that long
I write back strong, heard everything that you said, Thomas
The snotty nosed monster up under your bed, Thomas
I know you can't, I know you can do it again, Thomas
Get off track, and that train gon' carry your head on it
Made my head hornet, like it is a ghost in a shell
Fit in pocket more than Token himself
I approach him in stealth
Then reappear and grap his throat for a yell
Soaking my nails, then I rip it like I'm opening mail
Oh, what you say: ""you a Jersey Cat""? We ain't heard of that
This' the different side, boy: Imma murder rap
Before you step inside my ring, better learn some facts
I make you see his chest bleed, when his shirt is black
Chasing the ether like it's laced in his pizza
Hitman for hire, and I don't do no basic shit neither
I'm itching to fire on niggas as they lacing their Smeakers
Make sure the silencer hit 'em as they fade in the speakers

Nigga, it's Tox!

I went to see the Octomom and asked if she still milking
And walked in on Soulja Boy going down on Paris Hilton
Helped little momma put on lip gloss that's cum flavored
And yoked up Asher Roth at the fraternity fundraiser
I'm a hammerhead shark in a sea of goldfish
Sniffing pills with Heath Ledger and Anna Nicole Smith
Me and Kanye ran on Trish and tell her switch limousines
Don't tell nobody that shit; bitch was only seventeen
I poisoned Mariah Carey, just to piss off Nick Cannon
I ate out Brooke Hogan and for a month I spit semen
Me and Jean-Claude Van Damme was doing coke down in Miami
Seen Danny Bonaduce on a strip hunting for trannies
Got all three Jonas Brothers high off of one joint
And forced them to fuck a hooker with aids at gunpoint
Rihanna hit me on Twitter, told me meet her for dinner
She kept talking 'bout Chris so I cocked back and hit her
I'm here to give the industry a hysterectomy
Lady Gaga winking at me pissing in the urinal next to me
These words will be the death of me like the last bitch that ran from me
Me and Chuck E. Cheese and Chuck E. Cheese with Casey Anthony
Ben Rothelisberger lied to me, said he didn't rape him
Then said: “find some bitches, they ain’t fucking we gon’ make ‘em”
I've seen Khloe Kardashian benching more than I weigh
High-fived Adam Lambert and got affected with aids
I pushed Tila tequila like I play for San Diego
And fucked Heidi Montag till she start melting to play-doh
If Fantasia I could become a better person
Celebrity rehab with a big bottle of bourbon
Whores at the Jersey Shore, Snooki said I could skeet her
Left with an orange dick and a drip from the Gonorrhea
Smoking L’s with Michael Phelps, sitting slanted in the Buick
Micheal Jackson's dead, but that don't mean he didn't do it
Now to this motherfucker, this is where it's heading:
How you dissing me when you are wearing Adidas leggings?
Pussy boy, I don't fuck with Tox
Yo, hold on, hold on...

7018,"On the rise like the Benedict and Cardinal's, Knock ‘em out the park
Don’t play for the Cardinals, can't pay for your car note
Figures, because they all broke
Need a pawn shop, but the boys are non-go

Welcome to the slideshow killer, never would you have it
My baby is the future of this magic
Sick of chasing tails on this silly rabbit
So enough with this hat trick, enough with this whack shit
I was thinking backward
It was up to me, but baby luckily, I found you
You help take off the clown shoes
You was my almond joy, now you're my mound dew, ready for part 2

When it comes to love sometimes, I don’t know what to do
It makеs sense becausе that's the only reason I met you
I'll give you what you want, just don't make me look like a fool
Keep it True Bae bae, Wha Wha Wha Wha Wha
Bae bae Wha Wha Wha Wha Wha bae bae

Awe… you inspire me, to write this rap, you entirely
I fall back, I know you tired G
I inspire you; you inspire me, what a Thug a do, with all this irony
Fam say, what the fam say, it's the coach that makes the damn plays
If you let the players' takeover, you're going to need yourself a makeover And even Jay had to thank Hovah
I put my life on hold, it was just you and me though
Got to the line, not shouting a free-throw
On the real, feeling like Tebow
You know the deal; them chicks know the real

When it comes to love sometimes, I don't know what to do
It makes sense because that’s the only reason I met you
I’ll give you what you want, just don't make me look like a fool
Keep it True Bae bae, Wha Wha Wha Wha Wha

I Wake up
I Dip out the bed

I Arise
Mid afternoon
Lay back down round 3am
Walk my dog 4 times a day
Play 1010
Then watch a film
Make my beats
In sweats ‘tween sheets
Rest my eyes
And stretch my limbs
Work from home and
Write my songs
As this prolonged
I’m feeling this...

I Dip out the bed

Verse 2:
Hop in the car
I Put the masks
In the bag
Hop out
Put em on
Run through the store
We Do the dash
Fore
They close
Hope to get it
Fore it’s gone
I Do what I can
And I want
Truthfully
I ain’t gon front
Comfort is holding me hostage
Plus, Me in a rush
Ain’t a must
Yeah
On a sabbatical anyway
On a break until these feelings fade
Damita Jo, on an escapade
Letting desire Come back to me
Ironically on a roll
Waited a while
Then composed
Ain’t it funny
How the time flies
When everything’s out of control
Cause I


Chorus:
Wake up
I Dip out the bed
Then I roll out
Raise up
Make sure I’m fed
And there’s no doubt
If I Stay up
Then I get Prepared
Just to stroll out
Wait up

203,"The hair on your arms is standing on end, so you fasten your coat ‘til no air can seep in. But your fingers won’t move, they’re froze in a fist that you raise to the air, as if to resist. But slowly it falls back into your lap. This car is a cage, this drive is trap that will lead to a grave, a tear in your map, with crosses to trace the line of your path

The windows are down, there’s ice in your hair. You wore it out wet, too tired to care. Now you drive with a crown of frost on your brow, like some arrogant king who’s too proud to bow to the sun that beckons before him and the warmth that’s ‘round the bend. But you drive with your eyes closed, intent to be led

There once was a world so perfect and flat, men sailed off her edge or fell in the mouths of the dragons that scoured for ships to devour. And heroes wrote songs to tell of their power. But now there are roads that pass without end, as you drive alone, no lives to defend from the dragons that sleep in some distant sea. You quiet their jaws with whispers you sing

Those curious maps cannot still exist, for oceans dry up and continents shift ‘til the world’s born anew from infinite hues that drain into one uninspiring view. So this is your fate, to drive ‘til you find that one desert’s dust is another man’s sky, and the clouds he admires are crushed by your tires, as you wish you could share a similar desire, to see some small light in the distance (a horizon held in place by a faith you thought was lost)
To lead you away"

Walk to the lazy beat

People find their seats

To our stained glass walls
However high we climb
No matter how many times we fall

From our greatest triumphs
To our deepest defeats
There is a song forever being sung by the redeemed
We can lift our voices
The strong, the weak, come on

We will cry through the sky with a melody
Till our courage shakes the ground
We are now, we are love for all eternity
Let this breath join heaven’s sound

In our secret addictions
Let mercy flood in
And out of forgiveness
The power to break the chains begins
And out of the ashes
Beauty of love and life returns
And let us lift our voices
The strong, the weak come on

Heaven’s sounds, let the guilty be clean
Heaven’s sounds, like the rolling of thunder
Heaven’s sounds, let prisoners free

And I feel a little low
Oh, but it's my fault
'Cause I know where to go
When I need to feel loved
When I need to feel special
I can call on Jesus, He's the lover of my soul

Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
'Cause I need your love, yes I do
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
My Lord, just come on by
Come by here
Come by here
Come on by
It's time to be patient
I gotta stop hesitating
I gotta hang to love that's real
My father knows what I want
And He knows what I need
His promises put my heart at ease

So when I'm lonely or sad
When I feel a little low
When everything from the outside tells me I'm all alone
I can call on Jesus, the lover of my soul
He'll step on by, no matter day or night
He'll make everything all right

Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
'Cause I need your love
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
My Lord, just come on by
Come by here
Come by here
Come on by
Come by

At this moment I'm sad
And I feel a little low
Oh, but it's my fault
'Cause I know where to go
When I need to feel loved
When I need to feel special
He'll stop on by, no matter day or night
He'll make everything all right
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Jesus, come on by
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
My Lord, just come on by

Come by here, my Lord, come by here
'Cause I'm standing here
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Standing here in need of prayer
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Don't you tarry, no, no, no
And hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Father God I give you all of my broken dreams
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Come on by
Come by here, my Lord, come by here
Jesus, come on by
Yeah
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry, Lord"
1658,"Verse 1:
Everything was Everything
But baby I never meant for it to end
At least didn't mean for it to end for us like this
Now you be calling me saying I, I broke your heart
When you never really loved from the start

[Refrain]
I was holding on
For what, I did not know
But I ain't holding on no more

(Oh!)

[Verse 2]
Lonely Days, Lonely Nights
Just what did you expect?
I would be waiting round 'til the end
Just for the kids
Mama used to tell me that one day
I'd get tired of the lies
Finally, that day has come around
[Refrain]
I was holding on
For what I did not know
But I ain't holding on no more

[Chorus]
Cause I Realize
I don't need you in my life
I'll be alright
I can make it on my own
You thought that I would fall all apart
But now
You're needing my love

[Verse 3]
No more 6 in the morning
You just walking in (and were fighting again)
Spending all my late nights wondering
Where you been?
Or who you wit?
Or what you been doing?
No more mysterious phone calls on your phone
Now you calling me when you're alone
I try to leave, but you hold on, just let it go

[Refrain]
Cause, I was holding on
For what I did not know
But I ain't holding on no more
[Bridge]
Cause I tried to give you
All I had
But you never reciprocated that to me
No matter all the tears that you saw me cry
Still, you could never act right

[Refrain]
See I was holding on
For what I did not know
But I ain't holding on no more

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Cause, I was holding on
For what I did not know
But I ain't holding on no more
I'm sorry (I'm sorry baby, it's over)
But it's over (I'm sorry baby, we're done)
I'm done with you (I'm sorry baby, it's over)
I can't hold on no more (I can't hold on no more)
I'm sorry (I'm sorry baby, it's over)
I ain't fucking with you no more (I'm sorry baby, we're done)
We're so done (I'm sorry baby, it's over)
So over (I can't hold on no more)
I won't hold on no more"

Dear folks
We're having a serious topic, you know
Calm down and don't panic

Downfall
The downfall of everything
Seems so near
Downfall
See what happened in hamburg in July 2017
The streets were burning
G20-protesters burning cars of poor and unconcerned people
Meaning to fight capitalism
Breaking into an apple store, stealing iPhones and whatever
Making selfies in front of the devastating mess
Man, this looked like a fuckin civil war
Police telling people to stay at home
Where's this leading to?
They were throwing flagstones onto the police from rooftops
What the fuck?
And yet media is only showing and reporting ONE side of the story
Is there another? is this true? i'm worried

This is so wrong
This is so perfectly wrong
And nothing but wrong"
3802,"You've been checking some girls heart
For some tenderness
But all you found this far
Her credit card eyes and some pretentiousness
Tell her you're gonna have to pass
If she don't like it she can kiss your ass
Cos all you wanted anyway
Was your take home pay

Take home pay, better spend it as fast as you can
Take home pay, buy yourself a lover beats beatin’ it by hand
You know what they say
Money can't buy happiness
But you 're feelin real good
When you’re real well dressed
And you're blowin them all away
Spending your take home pay!"

7792,"Did you fail primary school?
Are you lost without a clue?
No matter, cause anyway
THEY have it in for you

Jesus is the internet
Space jews chemtrailed nine-eleven
And only the righteous
Will be hoovered into heaven

Do you think you’re now one of them
The famous secret few
You feel special, so it must be true
And THEY are now after you

Nazi aliens vaccinate us
Full of AIDS from the hollow Earth
China pushes the climate hoax
Run by lizards in UFOs

It takes more than fifteen liars
To control a world
And why do THEY conspire?
Because bible, because Satan
Because reasons
They’ve been hiding everything from everyone for thousands of years
Sure, and no-one ever talked
Clinging to their power with infinite man-hours
But why stop there
There’s more that THEY concoct

Dinosaurs built the pyramids
Annunaki walk among us wearing suits and ties and shoes
Opticians CGI the matrix into our eyes
Leaving clues
In our tattoos

The world will end on Saturday
And then again some time in May
And for every fuck-up until then
We know who dunnit: They!

Too dumb to see you’re stupid
Too deranged to see what’s true
Your failures, they are never your fault
Cause THEY are controlling you

It takes more than fifteen liars
To control a world
And why do THEY conspire?
Because money, because *lawrl*, because reasons
Nothing that requires everyone will ever, ever work"

Love is what you called it feeling stupid now I’m ballin
Tryna understand why you left me feeling useless
Girl you only thing I need besides the music
Truly loving never lose you tender hearted never bruise it
Stuck in the studio like i barely knew you
Broken since day 1 no one can feel that distance
If you thеre too then you’ll feel this through the mic
Thinking bout you likе every single night
Not tired of the fights just tired of this life
Why we gotta lie like why we gotta try
When all i need is you
All the girls in the world couldn't replace you
But your mind is clouded always stay up doubting
Not like them other guys promise i won’t lie
Cause all i’m tryna do is be with you
Love is hard i get that all to well
Some love is heaven other love is hell
Me n you go together like a hammer and a nail
Tryna show you this real love
Like a fantasy or a cartoon
Yeah we finna spark soon
Cause baby love is crazy
Then again i’m crazy over you
Real love is inspirational, sensational, and insatiable

Love is like a drug I really can’t come down
Hope you hear my sound hope you dig it too
But for now please keep doing you
Because i would wait forever for my boo
My music make it harder money lasting longer
Soon we get these foreign cars and a mansion
Make me happy the way you up there dancing
When you hear this song play it like an anthem

Can we take it back?
Back to all the glowin'
Before it got so bad

And might we find the answer
Just goin' with what's done
Or are we gonna change it?
I can't say you're not welcome

Cause you make see the stars right, oh, holy light
You make me wanna speak low, move fast and clean
You remind me of the buildings and the big screens
Cause you make me wanna think right
And be right

Oh, my love
Can we take it back?
Back to always knowin'
We take each other's slack
And might we just go dancin'
And never speak a word
And when the music changes
You'd lead me in a turn

Wonder if I got a legacy after I go
There's a long way and we ain't even started doing shit
Wonder if after years these words gon' flow
I've always wanted to mention my experiences
Wonder if someday they gon' help me grow
Spent so much time dealing with the person I was not
Living in the snow made me froze
Screaming but silence is the what I hеar the most
Keep on choosing deadlines I won't approach
Keep on making problеms that I won't solve
What's the point in praying to the lord?
What's the point in singing all these words?
Tell me if I ever wanna go home
Tell me if I go hard or go broke
Fell like I'm losing focus, losing hope
Feel like I never wanna be quoted
Feel like y'all move in slow motion
I see what y'all doing, I'm concerned about every single action, every movement
Hope I learn being fluent
Hope we get over that crew shit

Will the time we Spent together be precious even past death?

Looking at the night sky, I need passion
I'm gasping, I've always wanted to be extra active
I'm lacking in every single factor, every aspect
I don't believe in Practice, I don't believe in anthems
I don't believe in Trends and I don't believe in fashion
Sadly I witnessed blurick is the best thing that never happened
Imagine we never met and we never got this close

Being lone wasn't my choise but staying lone is my goal
I've been living like I turned the sound off and watching porn

Blowin' trees, I was trying to make my ends meet

By 25 I'll meet my maker

9533,"It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger""
But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
O you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah you hate to see another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It is curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It's you my love, you who are the stranger

""Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this
Or any other matter""
When he talks like this
You don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this
You don't know what he's after
""Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river""
Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, ""Ok, the bridge or someplace later""

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
""I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger"""
307,"[Intro]

Damn shawty
Got damn living it up ain't you
All that designer shit man
You know what I mean
Got damn you living a dream bruh

[Verse 1: Rittz]

My shades more expensive than your J's
My chain indicates that I'm paid
My lady say it's time to get engaged
She say I go on tour and misbehave
Our bills are never late
On the stage rocking like I'm Jimmy Page
But fuck swag, I ain't dressing up like Kid 'n Play
Trying to snap on every track like Eminem on Renegade
If you ain't heard of me then you been living in a cave
Or sitting in a grave, or listening to Drake
Any minute the shit will disintegrate
This music business is fishy like penetrating a bitch who didn't bathe
Wanted on the streets like I went to prison and escaped
Fuck the police, these authority figures get disobeyed
In the broad day bullets be grazing and ricochet
No games, only participating in pistol play
Im rappin I should be cracking  inside of a crème brûlée
It's like I'm pinned against a cage, fightin' in the MMA
Bitch
[Hook]

It is what it is but it ain't what it seems
People thinking that I'm living a dream
Ohhh ohhh yeahh yeahh
When I roll through in my old school Cut' Supreme
They be thinking that I'm living a dream
Ohhh ohhh yeahhhhh

[Verse 2: Rittz]

Yeah
My older brother's a teacher, one of his students asked
If I ever game him money, it's funny, people think I got stupid cash
If they only knew the half
Hoping I got loot to last me to June and it's April
Afraid to go and do the math
Covering my emotions, hope they don't see through the mask
From the outside looking in it's different, looking through the glass
Me and Tech ain't Bernz and Wrek, me and Wolf ain't Snoop and Daz
Cause the truth is that this music crap is difficult to grasp
That's why you never see me go on interviews and bash
Other rappers, I'm not the dude booin' while you at bat
Cause I still got a pill problem
My dollar bills still got a film on 'em
Feeling like some loser trash
Responding to Twitter mentions, groupies getting too attached
Homies clueless asking questions, ""When they sending you a plaque?""
Explaining how budgets work, recouping and how I'm stressing
Cause I never see a check from selling 50,000 records
But
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae]

Yeah
I'm sick of people speaking for me like ain't a day I was stressing
Why the fuck I'm living life somewhere lost in a thousand questions
Every blessing got me grateful but these haters got me hateful
So I take it 'til I'm permanent resting, but they don't see that
All they see is that I'm a trip
Fuck 'em, I'd rather kick it and dive inside they woman' lips
Yeah this whip I ride is nice but why you worried 'bout the price
What about they days I walk and hustle just to starve for nights
And that's for real
Why are they acting like they was on side of me
They don't remember when everyone lied to me
Left me alone and that was cool back then
But now that they looking they acting like they was the one that was doing it
Telling me they was my people
They thought they had me fooled back then
Not Trae, no not today, I'm living for me
No opinion got me in shackles, shit I'm living life free
And everything seem to be a dream, I tried to tell 'em wake up
But instead they'd rather hate me getting cake up
Shit

Now I’ve forgotten who I am

Floods and blinds the eye
Spiralling upwards in an eruption of malice
Thunderheads crash in violent torment
Shrouding the sky with icy hell
Burning the skin with frozen wind

Fingers grip cold wet stone
The final ascension draws near
Eyes fixed upon the sky
Feet planted in earth
Reaching the summit, I stand with pride
Defiant in the face of his power
This blackened rock is where it begins
War declared on the earth

Mightiest am I
As the wintry storm descends
I laugh in utter scorn
I take my seat on the mountainous throne
I gaze down on the void
Lost wisdom now mine to behold
I've become one with the dark
Wrath from which there is no escape
Fingers grip cold wet stone
The final ascension draws near
Eyes fixed upon the sky
Feet planted in earth
Reaching the summit, I stand with pride
Defiant in the face of his power
This blackened rock is where it begins

Had a dream I was still in my '89 Lincoln, yeah
Woke up, told God I was tryna change the world
He said, ""Boy, whatchu need? Whatchu thinkin'? (I got it)""
I said, ""I need the juice""
He said, ""Check your email""
I had a beat there from JuiceBangers
That'll work for some inspiration
808s all like a hockey player
He said, ""Go ahead, it's time to shine now""
I'm in your corner like timeout
Let the haters go and sleep sound
They gon' smell the Folgers when you grind out
And, Lord, please forgive me I have envy in my heart
Knowing I'm really Your son, wishing I was just a star
That was when I was selling mixtapes for gas in my car
How dare I look at what I got and say that You ain't gave it all
Know the universe all in Your hands, but I got ambition the size of a planet
Plus, I'm unqualified like Michael Scott in The Office, but somehow I manage, uh
Why would I panic?
Woke up right out of a casket
This time we 'bout to do damage
He got it covered like bandage

I done gave it all to Jesus, but sometime I try to keep it
I done came up from the bottom, but I done rocked arenas
I'd kill the show, get off stage, and still feel like I'm worthless
Maybe I should quit the circus, maybe I forgot my purpose
That's that–
See, I ain't tryna get down
But, boy, this life can kick you right into the ground
But I ain't afraid, no
Get up and try, day in, day out
Ooh

That's that dough
The kind that'll cook with you if you let it
The kind that'll kill you off at a murder scene
Get the yellow tape, there's another dream, yeah
We done came a long, long way
Yeah, I mean a long, long way
Cup of Kool-Aid, powdered eggs, fried bologna all on a plate (all on a plate)
Went from ramen noodles to the real ramen, not the kind with the powder (with the powder!)
Now I'm taking mama, get filet mignon with the side of the chowder (clam chowder!)
She deserve it
Worked a million hours, no off day
I want it all
So before I die I'm tryna make every week a vacay, yeah (make a vacay!)
And if I lose it all, I can't sell a record, know I'm okay, yeah (we good!)
'Cause God got me, yeah, God got me, boy, we okay, yeah (we okay!)
So I gotta get it
I can't be out here pretending like I ain't tryna win it (woo!)

Which some attempts to deny and hide

Open your eyes stop being blind you clearly see the horrors are real
Miserable conditions
Agony prolonged
Yet you ignore the pain they feel

Their propaganda has fucked your mind

Chickens debaked
Chicks are smothered
Pigs are starved
Bulls castrated
Veal cows fed hormones
Antibiotics
Female cows constantly impregnated
Mans tyranny over other living beings cannot be justified or proven safe
People starve while doom cows eat what could be theirs
Factory farms are modern day concentration camps

The conditions these animals are raised in are inhuman and extremely cruel
Forget these fairy tale images that the media has so conveniently led you to believe they are reared to live and eventually die in misery
They've put family farms out of business you profit from the animals suffering so it's up to you and I to stop the torture!!!"

And we've thought of every line that she might swallow

JC: Huh huh. Wow

JA: Malaysia Today, run by a wonderful guy by the name of Raja Petra who, he has two arrest warrants out for him in Malaysia, he is based in London, but his servers can't survive in London, they are in Singapore and the United States.

ES: But again, I get the, the, that's [indistinct] there are sites that participate in this?

JA: Yes, we have some fourteen hundred, but those are... we have mirrors that are voluntary as well as

ES: So they basically opt-in mirror sites.

JA: They determine their own risks, we don't know anything about them, we can't guarantee that they are all trustworthy, etc, but they do increase the numbers.

ES: You have been quoted in the press as saying that there is a much larger store of information that is encrypted and distributed. Is it distributed in those sorts of places?

JA: No, that's an open... we openly distribute backups of... encrypted backups of materials that we view are highly sensitive that we are to publish in the coming year.

ES: Got it.
JA: Not as some people have said so that we have a ""thermonuclear device"" to use on our opponents. But rather so that there is very little possibility that that material, even if we are completely wiped out, will be taken from the historical record.

ES: So, so and eventually you will reveal the key that is necessary to decrypt it.

JA: No, ideally, we will never reveal the key.

ES: I see.

JA: Because there is things, like, so redactions sometimes need to be done on this material.

ES: Sure.

JA: So it's... our view is that the material is so significant that even if we released it as is, with no redactions, that the benefits would outweight the harms. But through redacting things we can get the harm down even more.

ES: And I understand that. One more sort of tactical question for now. So, my simple explanation is that the tools will get better for an anonymous sender send to a distrustful recipient, and then this anonymous [noise] your describing. We will get to the point where the... a very large amount of people using such services for all sorts of reasons: truthful, lying, manipulation, what have you. The current technology used... basically, like FTP [indistinct] runners sent to you. Basically people will FTP something and then just sort of ship it to you.

JA: No we have... we have lots of different paths. And that's quite deliberate. And we don't say which one is used more than which other one, because that means that investigative resources have to be spread across all possible paths. But they are from in-person, in the mail. Postal mail is still actually pretty good if you want to send anonymous stuff. Encrypt something to a key, if you think it might be intercepted on the way, send it from somewhere, it's still pretty good. Straight HTTPS uploads, although they are not actually sort of straight. But to the user it looks like they are straight. Behind the scenes all sorts of other stuff is going on. The biggest problem with computer security is not communication. It's end points.

ES: Right.

JA: And so dealing with end point attacks both on someone trying to send us information and more importantly if someone tries to send us information is themselves compromised, that's one compromise of one person. If our engine that receives information is compromised, that is a potential compromise of every person that is trying to send us material.

ES: I guess I... I didn't ask my question quite right. If the... Is there some new technology which in your view would kind of materially change this simple model that I have about, of the vast increase of...

JA: Yes! So I've...
ES: So what are those technologies?

JA: The most important one is naming things properly. If we are able to name some... a video file or a piece of text in a way that is intrinsically coupled to the information there, so that there is no ambiguity-- a hash is an example of this--but then there's variations, maybe you want one that human beings can actually remember. Then it permits this information to be spread in such a way where you don't have to trust the underlying networks. And you can flood it.

ES: Why don't you have to trust the underlying networks?

JA: Well because you can sign... you can sign the hashes.

ES: You can sign the name as well as the content.

JA: You can sign the hash.

ES: You can sign the hash.

JA: And that's the hash. If a name is like a hash.

ES: So it's... it's unambiguous as to whether...

JA: Yes.

ES: You're basically saying you have a provable name...

JA: Yeah.

ES: As opposed to an alterable name.
JA: And those sorts of mechanisms are evolving now. We have been using something like this internally, I've been writing a paper on it to try and make this a standard for everyone. But you can see they are actually evolving. If we look at magnet links... have you seen these? There is an enhancement of BitTorrent, which is a magnet link, and a magnet link is actually a hash.

ES: Right right.

JA: So it is hash addressing. It doesn't point to any particular server, rather there is a big hash tree.. a distributed hash, three over... I don't know how technical I should get... There is a big distributed hash tree over many millions of computers involved in thee hashtree, and many many entry points into this hashtree so it is very hard to censor. And the addressing for content is on the hash of the content.

ES: Right so you are basically doing the hash as the address, and you do the addressing within the namespace to provide... so as long as you have a signed...

JA: As long as you get the hash...

ES: ...you can't hide it.

JA: Well, there's a question as to you've got a name of something, you've got a hash, but what does that tell you. Nothing really, because it is not really human readable. So you need another mechanism to get the fact that that's important to you.

ES: Sure.

JA: And that is something like WikiLeaks signs that, and says that that is...

ES: An interesting piece of information

JA: ...an interesting piece of information, and we have verified that it is true. But that, once you feed that information into the system then it becomes very unclear how it got into the system. Well how do you get rid of it from the system? And if you do get rid of it, if someone does manage to get rid of it, you know for sure that it's been gotten rid of, because the hash doesn't resolve to anything anymore. Similarly, if someone were to modify it, the hash changes...

JC: I was just gonna say, why wouldn't they just rename it, rather than...

JA: They can't because the name is intrinsically coupled to the intellectual content.

ES: I think the way to explain this... To summarise the technical idea is... take all the content in a document, come up with a number, so if the content is gone, the number doesn't match, show anything. And if the content has changed, the number doesn't compute right anymore. So it is an interesting property.

JC: Mm hm. So...

JA: So...

ES: So how far are we from this type of system?

JA: On the publishing end, the magnet links and so on are starting to come up. There's also a very nice little paper that I've seen in relation to Bitcoin, that... you know about Bitcoin?

ES: No.

JA: Okay, Bitcoin is something that evolved out of the cypherpunks a couple of years ago, and it is an alternative... it is a stateless currency.

JC: Yeah, I was reading about this just yesterday.

JA: And very important, actually. It has a few problems. But its innovations exceed its problems. Now there has been innovations along these lines in many different paths of digital currencies, anonymous, untraceable etc. People have been experimenting with over the past 20 years. The Bitcoin actually has the balance and incentives right, and that is why it is starting to take off. The different combination of these things. No central nodes. It is all point to point. One does not need to trust any central mint. If we look at traditional currencies such as gold, we can see that they have sort of interesting properties that make them valuable as a medium of exchange. Gold is divisible, it is easy to chop up, actually out of all metals it is the easiest to chop up into fine segments. You can test relatively easily whether it is true or whether it is fake. You can take chopped up segments and you can put them back together by melting the gold. So that is what makes it a good medium of exchange and it is also a good medium of value store, because you can take it and put it in the ground and it is not going to decay like apples or steaks. The problems with traditional digital currencies on the internet is that you have to trust the mint not to print too much of it.

[laughter]

JA: And the incentives for the mint to keep printing are pretty high actually, because you can print free money. That means you need some kind of regulation. And if you're gonna have regulation then who is going to enforce the regulation, now all of a sudden you have sucked in the whole problem of the state into this issue, and political pushes here and there, and who can get control of the mint, push it one way or another, for particular purposes. Bitcoin instead has an algorithm where the anyone can create, anyone can be their own mint. They're basically just searching for collisions with hashes.. A simple way is... they are searching for a sequence of zero bits on the beginning of the thing. And you have to randomly search for, in order to do this. So there is a lot of computational work in order to do this. And each Bitcoin software that is distributed.. That work algorithmically increases as time goes by. So the difficulty in producing Bitcoins becomes harder and harder and harder as time goes by and it is built into the system.

ES: Right, right. That's interesting.

JA: Just like the difficulty in mining gold becomes harder and harder and harder and that is what makes people predict that there is not going to be a sudden amount of gold in the market, rather...

ES: To enforce the scarcity...

JA: Yeah, to enforce scarcity, and scarcity will go up as time goes by, and what does that mean for incentives in going into the Bitcoin system. That means that you should get into the Bitcoin system now. Early. You should be an early adopter. Because your Bitcoins are going to be worth a lot of money one day. So once you have a... and the Bitcoins are just... a Bitcoin address is just a big hash. It's a hash of a public key that you generate. So once you have this hash you can just advertise it to everyone, and people can send you Bitcoins, and there is people who have set up exchanges to convert from Bitcoin to US dollars and so on. And it solves a very interesting technical problem, which is how do you stop double spending? All digital material can be cloned, almost zero costs, so if you have currency as a digital string of numbers, how do you stop me... I want to buy this piece of pasta.
[JA using lunch table objects]

JA: Here is my digital currency and, now I take a copy of it. And now I want to buy your bit of egg. And then you go... and now I want to buy your radish! And you go, what? I've already got that! What's going on here? There's been some fraud! So there's a synchronization problem. Who now has the coin? So there is a point to point.. a spread network with all these problems, some points of the network being faster, some points of the network being slower, multiple paths of communication, how do you solve this synchronization issue about who has the currency? And so this is to mind actually the real technical innovation for Bitcoin, it has done this using some hashtrees and then a delay time, and then CPU work has to be done in order to move one thing to another so information can't spread too fast etc. OK, so, once you have a system of currency that is easy to use like that, then you can start to use it for things that you want to be scarce. What is the example of some things that we want to be scarce? Well, domain names. Names. We want names to be scarce. We want short names to be scarce, otherwise if they are not scarce, if it doesn't take work to get them, as soon as you have a nice naming system, some arsehole is going to come along and register every short name themselves.

ES: Right. That's very interesting.

JA: So this Bitcoin replacement for DNS is precisely what I wanted and what I was theorizing about, which is not a DNS system, but rather short names... short bit of text to long bit of text tuple registering service. Cause that is the abstraction of domain names and all these problems solved. Yes, you have some something that you want to register that is short, and you want to couple that to something that is unmemorable and longer. So for example, the first amendment, that phrase, the ""US first amendment"", is a very short phrase, but it expands to a longer bit of text. So you take the hash of this text, and now you have got something that is intrinsically coupled to that which is unmemorable. But then you can register ""US First Amendment"" coupled to the hash. And that then means you have a structure where you can tell whether something has been published or unpublished, you can... one piece of human intellectual information can cite another one in a way that... can't be manipulated, and if it is censored the censorship can be found out. And if one place is censored, well you can scour the entire world for this hash, and no matter where you find you know it is what you wanted precisely!

ES: Right

JA: So that, in theory, then permits human beings to build up an intellectual scaffold where every citation, every reference to some other part of human intellectual content, is precise, and can be discovered if it exists out there anywhere at all, and is not dependent on any particular organization. So as a way of publishing this seems to be the most censorship resistant manner of publishing possible, because it is not dependent on any particular mechanism of publishing. You can be publishing through the post, you can be publishing on conventional websites, you can be publishing using Bittorrent, whatever, but the naming is consistent. And same is for... publishing is also a matter of transferring, you can... all you then have to do is, if you want to transfer something anonymously to someone else, one particular person, you encrypt the information with their key, and you publish it."

For I did not know, nor did she infer
How much there was to read and guess
By her in me, and to see and crown
         By me in her.
Wasted were two souls in their prime,
And great was the waste, that July time
         When the rain came down."

Singing through my window like a bird
When the wind blows through my curtains
I can feel you moving through the room
But I just want to see your face tonight

I've been seeking fame and fortune
Drinking from the tables of the kings
Thought I've reached the depths of wisdom
But I'm still lost, oh I don't have a clue
Until I find my way back home to you

If I can see your face, if I can hear you cry
If I knew what to say, if I can ease my mind
I can find my way back home to you
I can find my way back home to you"

in the corridor
alone
faces, hands & feet
the vortex of a smile permeates good taste
a lushes flavor of a scent
to bask in the vast expanse of love
coming down out of heaven up above

we stare at the ceiling at night
a black cat sending quite a bit of fright
outside the fervor of laughter on its decorum
we tend to sweep things underneath the rug
when all the great while we are in need of a hug
to love a hand to hold a heart will mend
columns of ivy hue but you say its nothing knew

we laugh, cry & disagree
sullen brevity
angelic sighs in her eyes
the twilight sun has tainted my inner vision
a souls fixation
alone again"

This is all the story of Solomon Waste

He fussed and worked and toiled all frothing
And at the end of all did nothing

Always hurrying yet never in haste
This is all the story of Solomon Waste

He lived in wishing and in striving
And nothing came of all his living
He worked and toiled in rain and sweat
And nothing came out of all that

Always hurrying yet never in haste
This is all the story of Solomon Waste"

chasing me large and fast
with her menstrual-coloured laser
sword (while wearing a black as black
silk cape) in our weird backyard
where she had dropped her rolling
pin earlier; its golden handle,
still covered in sawdust, lavender
crushed grean peas, grapes and raisins
and of course, baking soda. In this decrepit
photograph, my testes have just
dropped, my sex life is in ruin,
and my subscription to National
Geographic, paid in full – two more years."

We swore we'd travel, darlin', side by side
We'd help each other stay in stride
But each lover's steps fall so differently
But I'll wait for you
And if I should fall behind
Wait for me

Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true
But you and I know what this world can do
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see
And I'll wait for you

There 'neath the oak's bough, soon we will be wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees

I'm a mammoth king evoked, conjured by your dreams
Summoned by your fears. You need me, you feed me
I'm the imposing giant. Infallible dictator
My rules apply to all. You'll heed me, bleed for me

I am life. I'm death. I decide your fate
You empower me. You'd even kill for me

Guzzling down your dreams - the tears of unheard pleas I drink
Imbibe with such delight the fear that floods your temporal shell
Raging red rivers and streams - the kingdom of my shadow
Where dread of man in endless night revives my every cell

To those who doubt - your wounds will never heal
To those who question my creation - I'm not real

I am pain. I am grief. I'm the things you fear

I can grab you by the hips

Swinging me from side, to side, to side

Just let me be the one who gets to call you, be

Oh your love is nothing I’d sell
Oh you, you, you’ve got me wanting more

Can I kiss your neck?

I can hold you very near

Swinging me from side, to side, to side

Ayo bois, GamerBoi69 here, and today we're, uh, we're not back for any Runescape videos or any ferret videos, no n-n-n-n-no. Uh, today we are actually back for a rap song. Uh, this one's goes ou--, this one goes out to all the people who doubted me... uh, you were right, let's go, ay, like...

[Verse 1]
Ay, I’ll admit it, hey mom, I got a ferret
My apartment said no pets and yet I get it, but I don’t sweat it
My neighbor’s stressing, said he’s kicking me out
But I don’t vouch for that
I’m doubt he’s got the balls to try and flout it to my face
Wait, I’m late for a day’s work
Of sitting on my ass, passing gas and unpaid work
I’m making videos, top tens and reactions
That are lacking any content
Constant ads bring the cash in
I ain’t payed my taxes in over six years
Slip the bills in the trash and they have to disappear
I’ve been spending too much money on my ferret anyways
He doesn’t need food, feeding rude myths by heavyweights
Speaking of which, I be clocking 230
Talking pounds of doing rounds of Fried Cheetos and a qwerty
But I’m happy, little acne, mama say it ain’t a virtue
Dad, he never spoke about it, threw me out at curfew
[Bridge]
Yeah, uh, that's just--, that's just stupid... right, rap! Ayo

[Verse 2]
Listen I ain’t stereotypical
All you cynical hypocrites better get off your ass and go live some
Cuz I play Runescape, getting shit done
We hitting six thousand subscribers I’m getting hits, money
I just filmed my ferret eat a carrot off the floor
'Bouta post it, un-devoted, making racks of four
Well, not four figures, just four dollars
But hey, I mean I still consider myself a baller, that’s all

[Outro]
Jazz is lame
This ain't a fade out cuz fade out's for losers, I agree with Smurty Boi on that one..."
6808,"Was it just the winter stars, or did it seem so far to the gates on the moor?
Spilled that shot of apathy halfway down in the shades of distilleries
Did we just die... Or did the liquid sky sink and spiral down through the trees?
The echoes wave into the glass, a fragment of the final signal
This ship is just a specter-shell; The trail is gone but these tracks burn a scar in the field
Openings and airlocks breathe into the bay as it’s all erased
Stirred those pools of lipid ink, now the ghosts have found a permanent host in me
Hallucinations and memories, embers sent up light-years out of our reach

High above the tree-line, vibrations blur the gauges and LED's
Sullen eyes euthanized in the calm of the twilight sky
But still we see
And somehow know
Just stay and wait til the pain is gone
Let innocence be just this once

Endless miles of gray shade, promises of another reality
Drops of morphine shine on the backlit dew of a dying memory
We'll slowly breathe
And cease to be
Delay the calcination some
Bide our time by the setting sun
Condensation forms a chandelier, reflecting tinder and waning solar beams
Ebbing consciousness, prismatic residuum and undertow
Just disengage
And let it drift away
Steal one last glimpse of the bloodless moon
Alleviation will set in soon"
6560,"[Verse 1]
Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Changin' the minds of pretenders
Chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts ringin' in the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey
Ha-ee-ya, say, do you remember?
Ha-ee-ya, dancin' in September
Ha-ee-ya, never was a cloudy
Never was a cloudy

9289,"Summer turned ahead of green
Simples came wicked for this head of lettuce -
Camouflage condom
Wig on his head belly o' greed -
Slick wax floors before the door at the bottom of the slide
Walls turn to a point - slipping on the glass eye
As the lid blinks over this crushed lens -
Like the day that the lid closed the sky above your head -
Bleeding all over the maid but she's made to be fast but it won't last
Like the day that the lid closed the sky above your head -
We all bleed the same - (he can't make the difference in days they all bleed into the same) -

He's here now he might as well stay he plays
The game well he's not a sore loser -
He says sore losers are out before they
Even get up to swing - but he can't even get up with that belly o' greed -

Belly like a whale - but he's gonna get it one way or another and if he can't find it...
What is it that we suffer - is it in your head - like
The day that the lid closed the sky above your head - he gets closer every time"

But as long as there are stars above you

This world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

2110,"Being born and raised on the Navajo reservation in New Mexico, where Native American Indians were grown to make history. Living on the reservation made me experience life more adventurous, because it was me exploring horizons and living my childhood life to the fullest, not many children can go out and play on the reservation, where the sun is hot with large mountain peaks and beautiful canyons that you can see a mile away. Exploring these adventures made me who I am today, and when I am older, I can remember these spectacular experiences, growing up there taught me many different values in life and help me cope with cherishing family moments, especially me being a native American Indian, we have and believe in religion, Navajo culture and beliefs. Being a Native American is a prestigious honor for me, having brought up differently and not the same as some young American families is something I cherish, having a Navajo culture is rare and I am very proud of where I come from and who I am

My sister is one of my role models, she taught me to never give up and always push yourself to become a better person. She inspired me to be who I am today, and to not give up, to have high expectations and positive outcomes so that I can contribute to having a better future. My older sister has graduated high school and she now goes to a university in Arizona, she has made me realize and made me want to have a better education, I will further my education by going to college, so I can have a good steady job later in life. My sister has also participated in cross country; she received a scholarship for cross country, she told me to not give up on my soccer, because it’s my passion, and to always finish what you start even though life can have bumpy situations along the road

When i was younger, I was always close to my mom; she always gave me a reason to be a better person and never to give up on life. If I fail at something, she always told me to keep moving forward, even when you take the wrong path. I remember in third grade, our schools were going to participate in the spelling bee, and I wanted to win and take first place in my class. I begin studying every week, writing down words on flash cards, my mom helped me each day after school. I studied and studied and studied loads of words that were from 1st to 5th grade. I felt confident as the days and weeks by, I was fully determined, and all i wanted was to begin!

Finally the day came, I walked in the classroom ready, pumped to win, after waiting, which seemed like a century, in reality it was only five minutes. the instructor called my name, I walked to the microphone, nervously shaking, palms sweating, heart thumping, they told me to begin spelling Czechoslovakia, I was anxious, because I didn't remember, my mind went blank, I looked straight into the crowd and saw my mom smiling, I looked at her and in back of my head, I saw Czechoslovakia pop up like a light bulb with clouds, I also heard my mother’s voice echoing and telling me to not give up, try your best even when life is hard

I began pronouncing the word in my head and finally begin spelling, suddenly the buzzard went off as soon I was done, the instructor smiled grimly and told me I got it correct. I smiled with happiness, I could feel the joy in my heart and eyes, all the hard worked paid off and I won the spelling bee, the reason I won was because my mom was there by my side to help me study and told me I can achieve whatever if I give it my all, just strive for what I want and never give up. Till this day, I look at my trophy and smile because with hard work, comes determination, I just have to put in hard work , So my mom is one of my role models, just like my sister, and I look up to both of them and cherish the moments I can spend with them"

Hey yo I probably die another broke rapper who never made it
(Nurse I think the body that came in just levitated)
I get high to take the pain away that's as cliche as it sounds
I choke a DJ out like bitch how you gon play your feature now?
And hell yeah I'm finna broke no one gives a fuck about me
You see my name on flyers ever? Never know where I'll be
Creepin' in the bushes like Mexicans at the water drеamin' of a new land where thеy can finally drink the water
I drag a muthafucka to hell best believe that
(I saw the body. I killed him myself. You stubborn. No he's back)
I know from puffing dabs lighting kerosene covered rags
Then fleein' the scene with my ex's hand in a duffel bag
Don't tell me that I ain't the nicest around in a game that's disgraceful these days
It's a shame they can't pay me in likes from they Facebook and millions of video plays
I was raised by wolves and I far from my meals when the fake stuff's made from the real
You get marked for free I do work for me homie I don't give a fuck what you feel

[Verse 2: J Reno]
This blow's supremacy the top had the great way
Heavenly bars ready to break a rapper down fundamentally
My energy is endlessly flowing within my identity
The best MC I seek my destiny to reach my legacy
A beast let me get to be savage when I grab the mic
Been doin' this for half my life and that's why you ain't half as nice
Sleepin' on me that's all right suffer from insomnia
You really think you will? I just feel it's your hypochondria
If you doubt my presence I swear to God that I'll body ya
Voice duly minded is like fire the thermometers
Reel Wolf my squad is just ominous bottomless pit kickin' politickin' rappers like I'm as part of it
Cruising off to this I practice daily train hard for this
An artist with scars my pain displayed it from the start of this
And y'all don't want a problem with a dominant conglomerate
A man that got into the darkness came and I got lost in it
[Chorus: Swann]
I met God but usually the Devil prevail (P-P-Prevail)
Imma take you through the level to hell
I love death you motherfuckers get marked for free (M-M-Marked for free M-M-Marked for free)
'Cause I just do what works for me
I met God but usually the Devil prevail (P-P-Prevail)

[Verse 3: Raw B Snatch]
From the underworld crawling out the drain like the clown from IT
All this pain consumes me been around some shit
I'm everywhere but can't be seen like I'm dark matter
Creep to the scene with my machine and make your heart splatter
I got the Reign tatted don't get your frame shattered
Fuckin' with my team then we rearrange your face bastard
I'm from the world beneath where evil conquers
I creep with monsters that keep it poppin' the heat I'm cockin'
From the place below that down under
Reign Gang Reel Wolf howlin' in the thunder(Hooo!)
They all flow down here Georgie you're invited
Been in the shadows so long I don't know what light is
Uh forever times you come back in the afterlife and why ain't you never actin' right now I'm laughin' and castin' spells upon you
Hell has come and fuck that we in it already it's war
Got me armored up in this battle feel swingin' my sword
[Verse 4: Swann]
Straight out the depths of hell throw my slap in the Devil
I'm a evil heathen you don't want to step into my mental
Without me there's no fire in the place
Got a pen and paper honestly I'm dying to disgrace
My sick twisted thoughts always get me in predicaments
Paid my dues for my soul to keep lingering
Listen to me whispering demonic hands switch your mind in seconds make you slit your wrist and off your parents' heads
See every bar I spit I'm tryna raise the dead
Bring this underworld to the surface and paint the town red
Howlin' at the moon on the hunger prowl
Knife and fork ready set grace time to feed my mouth
My shadow sayin' we out of line
I done find the meaning of that takin' clear some hinds
Take you through the levels I'll lead you through every step
Might I suggest that you don't trust me I'm taking your last breath

[Chorus: Swann]
I met God but usually the Devil prevail (P-P-Prevail)
Imma take you through the level to hell
I love death you motherfuckers get marked for free (M-M-Marked for free M-M-Marked for free)

Nobody asked you to hit replay/
On my soul’s home videos I hate/
How I'm strapped to a movie theatre chair/
Eyes held open; reliving
Shame, pain, heartbreak I'm hoping you/
Heal my heart, my chest gets tight and I lose my breath/
Father heal my heart; before these tiny triggers remind me to death/

[Verse 1: Illijam]
I try to tiptoe
Cuz
Memories are light sleepers /
Right from the getgo;
That mortar hit my minesweeper/
Anywhere in this mine field, and anywhere in this mind field/
Recollections detonate; this grief is all my mind feels/
There ain't an anesthetic that can numb away my misery/
The ones I love the dearest cause my severest injuries/
I can’t lie, I’m not good at goodbyes/
And when I try, and when I don’t, I own this tortured mind/
[Verse 2: Illijam]
I wish we could wake up, somewhere down the line/
Maybe it would seem like a bad dream, and everything would be fine/
And I wouldn't ache and desolation would be replaced with brighter days/
And we’d be amazed there I go again daydreaming/
Then I flashback and I rehash, every little good thing we had/
Everyone sees I'm detached, 24/7 I relapse/
I loved you w/ all that I had, my misery tells me that's true/
It's agony how every scent, sight, & sound reminds me of you/
Catch me spazzing under my breath, paroxysm on my face/
When I recall how I compromised; I gave my naked heart; now I feel betrayed/
I look in the mirror and I hate who I see, I feel so abandoned O God hear my plea/
I'm losing my way in the wake of this bomb that has left me bereaved/
And I try to pray, but I am feeling like nobody hearing my cries/
I hate holidays cuz all I play is reruns
In my mind/
I fear this will never get better, and I cannot hold out for much longer/
I'm shivering in this crater waiting for the next round of bombers’ trauma/

[Outro 1: Jon Hendershot of Alive In Color]
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light

[Outro 2: Jon Hendershot of Alive In Color]
Be Thou my Vision, when everything’s dark/
Strengthen my soul so I don't disembark/
You are my highest joy; I'm a fool if I leave/
Comfort my hurting heart & help me believe/"
6246,"A storm beyond what eyes can see
But read my palm till the end
Deafening smoldered persistence
A rift never destined for mend
A somber lament insignificance
Lines traced in your eyes no repent
Horizons of fire dance with gypsy intent
Lustfully wisdom blankets our eyes
Hypnotized by fires inside
A Vessel unearthed and burning
And learning to burn alive
A sway of hand has taken our sight
Tint of drum hint of light"

When I take a deep breath I feel a different air from yesterday
One by one, the lights turn on

Cools down the fever I had all night
In my dry heart
Light spreads again
Making my frozen world breathe again
The sun rises again, unbelievably

All around the world - it's the blood in the words
All around the world - same pages
Trying to speak the language of love
Trying to speak the language of love

[Bridge]
Up against the tide of unjust years
Sentimental whispers seem to lose their meaning

[Verse 3]
What's happened to me
I look into my loved ones' faces
What matters to me
What matters in the four-walled spaces
I beg my flesh and bone to carry all I feel
A whirling wheel that words cannot conceal

[Chorus]
All around the world - it's the same thing
All around the world - it's the blood in the words
All around the world - same pages
Trying to speak the language of love
Trying to speak the language of love
[Chorus and Outro]
All around the world - it's the same thing
All around the world - it's the blood in the words
All around the world - same pages
Trying to speak the language of love
Trying to speak the language of love
Trying to speak the language of, language, language of love
Yeah
Oh, the language of love
Oh, the language of love
Language of love

He's as old as the sun
Want to know just what I've been saying

Yeah, times are hard and you find that you're in trouble
But it's hard to sympathize

Cut price or cut-up
Put up or shut up

Money where the mouth is, will there be just desserts?
White-collar crime – yeah, the summing-up
Will reckon surely nobody got hurt
Hey, offer jam tomorrow – the cash will do quite well
With your fair shares for all, try to practice what you preach
When they ring that Lutine bell
Hey, put your money where your mouth is
And hope the money talk will spring you from the cell

We've heard the empty promises, the barely veiled threats;
We've yet to see the colour of the money now –
We've yet to see it…
Oh, but we'll get to see it, you bet
Put up or shut up
Cut price or cut-up
Put the money where the mouth is

Yeah, you copped for quite a lot
But everything you got fell off the back end of the yacht
You did your best to grease the machinery
You shut us out of the talking shop:
The desks are empty when the buck full stops
Hey, you put your money where your mouth was not
You put your money where your mouth was not

Well, put the money where the mouth is
Snuffling in the trough
Yeah, put your money where your mouth is
With the pigs in the trough

5130,"I stand on ground I've walked before
To seek the way

And watch the moon rise into night
Illuminating with its light

My thoughts they turn in time and place
Illuminated Word of grace
Where I will find the way divine

A throne in sight that blazes like eternal dawn
The mystery of Father, Spirit and the Son
The Three in One

And precious stones of colours bright
Eagle and calf, lion and man
Do meet around the throne of light

In colours rich that last through time
In patterns of the Spirit's mind
Illuminated Word divine
I stand on ground I've walked before
To seek the way"

4344,"Touch the flame God is a consuming fire let me explain
A radiant night couples run to the pier for a chance to splash but then
Frozen from deep within there is a resistance to pull back from the magic of the moment
Rest assured God is our closest companion when all hell breaks loose
There is a tendecy to run away from God but there's something deep within holding you back
His chemistry is quite a mystery but one must we willing to receive
Let me share my testimony I was brought to Jesus in 79 Charlotte, North Carolina
It was in a gigantic swimming pool that I was baptized & received the Lord in my heart
Was an altar boy until the tender age of 13 drifting into Charismatic fellowships very extreme
There was a tug at my heart to impart a way of escape from religion formed a union with God
Although those many years would pass I had every reason to grasp what the bible said
The words of Christ penetrated my heart I read the gospel 5 times through
Each day I embark on a new demension with God he encompasses my very soul
Each day there's a brand new baby born & the night got his love to keep you warm
Was hospitalized in 89 with a bout with mono took my health in a tale spin
When I got out I was ever determined to be the star in the play and so i did just that
Got hooked up with both drugs and alcohol in the 90's to self medicate my problems
Time and time again i fell to the mercy of the Lord with my problems
One night I had a dream I would become the most influential poet of our time
As I awoke the problems didn't go away but i had God to guide me through each difficulty
There is no other healer through any problem like Jesus he is my sole purpose
People try to mock him, dismiss him and even crucify him all over again but he still shines
He is a friend to the stranger that has no hope willing to cope desperately in the night
I share my testimony with love so that others may come to know Jesus in a personal way
God is not a man that he should lie nor the son of man that he should change his mind
Jesus he is the healer of my soul & wants everyone to come to know him as well
So today your life maybe a living hell but I got a real true testimony to tell
You maybe in a bar down for the count hurting inside with so much pain
Remember the thief comes to kill, steal 7 destroy but God has come to give you life
Today I seek to know God in a fresh way with a whole host of challenges that I'm being faced
Tell him your wants, needs and desires whisper his name when you are feeling down
There is no better friend then Jesus he is always there for you standing at your hearts door & knocking"

Don't worry 'bout God baby
He's got a plan and it's true
Don't mind about destiny, she's carefree
Flirting with uncertainty
The apple knows morality
There's nothing that's in it for you

Don't think about death, honey
The thought alone it makes you look real funny
Your head heavy and your vision fuzzy
No, what they say it's ""keep your eye on the money""
No, what they say it's ""keep your eye on the prize""
Gracefully and suffocating on my lies
We'll hear the love you gather all around
When you're six feet underground

Don't talk about legacy
Ya know it's all a gain
Don't talk about fame and fortunes, bidding

You're more align with just up and quitting
Frankly it's all the same

Make your peace
Do a sacrificial dance
All your jubilant intentions never stood a chance
You see the coming on the end times
Or the end on the clouds
By your hand, superficial record dance like no one's ever truly gone
No one's ever really dead
In my defense
No ones worth a cent or pound

I'll say ""Good morning"" to your old photograph
Then I'll speak to you, dear
Just as though you were here

When purple shadows start to welcome the dark
I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park
And I'll cling to you, dear
Just as though you were here

But I know so well that distance and time
Will finally tear us apart
The farther you go, the longer you stay
The deeper the doubts in my heart

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear
Just as though you were here

And when I hear a lonesome train, I'm afraid
I'll think of all those trips we never quite made
Fragile dreams that we planned
Then I'll reach for your hand
Just as though, just as though you were here"

Now we watch soft shadows of leaves on the buildings

Never soul sick
On this new trip
Ivy wither
River shimmer
On the coal pier

Keep all the flags half mast
Worse even than we feared and twice as fast

Well I don't know a price tag I’m just callin it rent
I done sinned my whole life I no longer repent
And if you ain’t talking money it ain’t making no sense
But if her ass fat
She gotta text me right away bitch I got cash app
You know I run my city just like it's the last lap
Smoking on some shit straight out the gas cap
No Instagram cuz if I like you double tap that
Xanax bars put you on Mars just like you Bruno
Henny got me on Pluto I'm on one just like it’s Uno
Pockets on sumo, boss shit just like it’s Hugo
Getting wasted in a two door, how I know all the hoes you know?
Good gracious, went from pennies to the blue faces
50K on a choker tighter than shoe laces
Played my hand right now I’m in the club with aces
You played your hand wrong you down bad I don't say shit I just
[Hook]

Hop up in the coupe and I just swerve the lane (skrt)
You say that you poppin never heard your name
Gang ride for me and they deserve the same
Sending shots up at me you gon need to curve your aim
I don't play with em
And if you ever picking sides look you gon stay with em
It ain’t no question you a goner you let Kae get em
Everybody wanna be next y’all can fight for the fame while I count up a check

[Verse 2]

Stack a mil is the outcome
My city be strapped up, you lacking with out one
Niggas try to X your ass and I ain’t talking Malcolm
Niggas say they hot and I be lookin back like, how come?
Imma be clear fuck your career, how I’m better in a year?
Private jets no frontier, Gucci luggage that is the gear
No breaks or intermission, count up like it’s addition
Eat beats part of nutrition, get money always the mission
I done stayed on stayed on, how long I gotta wait?
I've been serving all these bum rappers I need a plate
If you wasn’t hip already it be too late
Most my niggas still in them trenches right to this date
I just make them hits that you can vibe to
Full magazine in the back yeah I’ll subscribe you
This for all my niggas that’s tired of getting lied to
Snakes don't pop up out the blue they right beside you (that’s why I just)
[Hook]

Hop up in the coupe and I just swerve the lane (skrt)

Shed light on the ones who clouded
Flexing on the ones who doubted
No bullshit burden me see wins
But never speak about it

Defeating my demons in tow

Flows so cold
They freeze all foes in they path
Kill the snakes in the grass
While I surpass them and laugh

I stay doing different, Seeing different Ugh
Reality shiftin, it’s consistent Ugh

Pretty little girl on the side of the road
Yellow hair in a yellow bow
Little thumb stickin' in the exit lane
Two packs of smokes and a candy cane
Woman hips, baby lips
A hallelujah book in the back of a pillow slip

[Chorus]
If she gets out of here too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon

[Verse 2]
She's been havin' the same old dreams
Of lullabies and pale blue skies
Fallin' asleep beneath the stars
Orion aims and shoots his arrows oh so far
Aims 'em hard
He shoots the moon and takes her as his own reward

[Chorus]
If she's gonna see those stars too soon
She'll run fast by the shy of the moon
[Verse 3]
She found out so long ago
That she wants more than all she knows
River ends right as she goes
Water breaks and she's gone down in the undertow
She's below
I'll stand tall and hold up high my mistletoe

She's gonna shine just like brand new
She'll take my hand and we'll run by the shy of the moon"

You're the one
Yes you are

I love my cherrybomb
It looks so sweet

Come to me sweet
You talk to my soul

Breaking through your touch
Dying too so softly
Dying felt so sweet

Why you cryin' bro?
Sometimes it seems impossible to escape the pain

[VERSE]
I’m a fuck up
I done fucked up
I’ll fill my cup
To shut it all up
Cover it up
Smothered in smut
Troubled enough
To slit at the cuff
Blow in a blunt
Kiss to a dove
Flying away
I do what I want
I move to the front
True and I stunt
Stew/Stu when I’m fucked
Coo-coo a bunch
I don’t feel good
I don’t feel bad
Think I feel fine
Like I always have
Switched up the flow
Switched up my hoe
Still feel the same
Murder he wrote
Smokin' my dope
Sing 'em a note
Hopin' to cope
Nobody's home
Nobody knows
Omens are cold
Open your soul
Hone in on tone
Poem from bone
Peace from a rope
Roped around throat
First time I choke
First time I spoke
First time I float
First time I fly
First time I don't
Last time I cry
This time she knows
I may be alive
But I'm dying to go
To places where flowers
And love do not show
Leave all that I have with
My mother to grow

I am alive but I’m dying to go

And make very rash decisions
For the sake of what I need
Dancing kisses on my cheek
It's the wonders that I seek
And I swear I am not afraid
There must be blood, and this I knew
I believe there must be wonders, too
I'll take up this quest-just say the word-
Even though I am small
And I have no sword
A party at the end is not required
And I promise I'll keep trying
Even if I get tired
It's the wonders that I'm after
Even if I have to fight
It'll all be hard and bloody
Even when I get it right
I know stories change their faces
On an inconsistent basis
But I swear I am not afraid!
There must be blood, and this I knew
I believe there must be wonders, too
If somersaults and lanterns aren't
The order of the day
I will still take up my weapons
And I'll be on my way
I am stubborn and won't listen
But I've made it this far
And I'd really like
To stay
Here must be blood, and this I knew
Surely there can be wonders, too
I cannot leave the cages locked

1057,"[Verse 1]
Bamboo shoots, Buddhas and removed shoes
Pugilism brewing over whose tuk-tuk's whose
Moving through the super-moon with goonies off a distant block
And fugitives from Dusit Zoo in pleasant moods until they're not
Present mood a startling departure from the temple rules
Part of it's the temperature, part of it's the tentacles
AQI alarming, surgical masks marching
The durian got him gagging, the traffic is anarchy, um
Siam spy cam, try him in fire
I'm marigolds and Muay Thai into the eye of the tiger
I almost died on a scooter, I almost died on a boat
I figure fuck it, baby, come as you are and die as you go
North bound, Lopburi, where it's humans: zero, monkeys: one
Humans fear the monkeys won, get your mirrored sunnies, run
Later watched a billion bats exploding out a mountain cave
Climbed a couple hundred feet to stare into the mouth and change
Descended a little different, every atom individually cleansed and repositioned
That's one unconventional exorcism for the kiddo
Hearts on his pillow, bars on the window
Bar band send it from John Denver to G-n-R
Midnight playing sardines to the sleeper car
13 hours, couldn't sleep at all
Even eating weed it's hard to catch a Z
Over all the sneeze and cough, jeez

I might never make it out
If I ever make it out send me back in
Got lost got found
Got a feeling I should lose it all again


OK, heaven is a humid room, it emulate a human womb
Everyday we celebrate a water birth in noodle soup
And cruise around as ronin trying to expedite a slow death
Playing chicken with a family of 5 on the same moped
Golden lotus that show off a pretty pantone
And grow in river water that'll melt your fucking hand off, damn
It's funny 'cause I fake a smile too
People thinking you're ok until you take 'em to the root
Imma take 'em to the root
Through insatiable depravity and layers of abuse
Down to radiate the truth
Ok, my homie said ""I just got blessed by a monk""
I said ""I got no frame of reference, God is dead where I'm from""
Still I been doing what I can to get these devils expunged
Lately it's laying sugarcane across an elephant's tongue
I'm wading out into the mud to scrub her belly and trunk
Brushing that yellow off her tusks, shit is better than drugs
It feels strange, hurdling emaciated strays
Even stranger days later when I'm no longer phased
Locals see a space garbage that fell from the interstellar
Trying to blend in with the smell of peppers, sweat and citronella - ella
Sore thumb in the hum of the helter-skelter
Rebels huffing through the temple run like Zelda's in the cellar
Every L.D. call an awful omen
Excuse me while I walk into the ocean, like

2778,"Good morning ladies and gentleman of the court. After a long trial, the jury has finally agreed unanimously on a verdict for the future of these three defendants. Although the KKK was claimed to be a part of the bombings and the affiliation with the defendants. The prosecutor was incapable of providing the jury and the court with sufficient and accurate evidence that DeniseMcnair, Addie Mae Carlton, Cynthia Wesly and Carole Robertson were killed by those three mеn. Therefore, thе verdict is: Frank Cherry not guilty for man slaughter, Thomas Blanton not guilty for man slaughter, Herman Fresh not guilty for man slaughter. The court of South Carolina, along with myself and the jury send our deepest condolences to the Mcnair, Carlton, Wesly and Robertson families. The Carolina state police and the FBI will continue to hunt for these three cold-blooded murderers with all the power that they have. Mr Cherry, Mr Blanton and Mr Fresh, you are now free to go, the court is now adjourned. It is now the year 2002. We are deeply sorry to the Mcnair, Carlton, Wesly and Robertson families again. What happened in 1967 was a disgrace not only toward our justice system but also to the memory of Denise, Addie Mae, Cynthia and Carole. Mr Cherry, Mr Blanton and Mr Fresh will spend the rest of their lives in prison. The court is now finally adjourned. So is it, I mean is it true that there are more ethnic conflict now there was 20 years ago, no they said that we shall believe them, no we will remember. They don't believe our process, four bodies, four souls destroyed. No occasion to protest, the minute we knew we'll just speak of what's the importance of this case. (You haven't die for nothing, no you haven't die for us X9) Go, for you I will build a coalition, (they don't believe now X2). No our arms will raise upon, no our mind will never shut down. (Is it a challenge to consider the others. It's not a question of good or evil. It's a fight for a collective anthemx2.)

Explanations: Racism is one of the biggest disease of our time. It is also a good basis in order to explain today's inequalities. Can we really claim to be a better society when a major part of our resources comes from slavery or exchange based on ignorance. This song talks about our hypocrisy concerning racial tension. A big part of the society continues to follow some false pre-established criteria. In 1967, these four little black girls (and I'm saying black in order to let you understand that their skin were just darker, the white pride invented this racist separation. For us, race does not exist) were killed during class by members of the KKK. Those fucking bastards have put a bomb and they were able to live free for 35 years. Today, this kind of story is taking 15 seconds of our daily news time if we are lucky. It's more important to know that the avalanche did won the Stanley Cup or that some artist was seen naked. Come on wake up, the media is not the problem. We are the problem. Everyone forgot this story except their families. We don't really want that kind of news. We want sports, sex and entertainment. If you really want to do something, read more different points of view. Take the time to think. Life is so fast that we barely have time to have the necessary time to do it. Those cases happen every second in the world but this is not normal. Consider the others. Go over all the fashion and all the racial criteria"
8552,"Letter the Tenth From Miss Margaret Lesley to Miss Charlotte Lutterell

Portman Square April 13th

MY DEAR CHARLOTTE We left Lesley-Castle on the 28th of last Month, and arrived safely in London after a Journey of seven Days; I had the pleasure of finding your Letter here waiting my Arrival, for which you have my grateful Thanks. Ah! my dear Freind I every day more regret the serene and tranquil Pleasures of the Castle we have left, in exchange for the uncertain and unequal Amusements of this vaunted City. Not that I will pretend to assert that these uncertain and unequal Amusements are in the least Degree unpleasing to me; on the contrary I enjoy them extremely and should enjoy them even more, were I not certain that every appearance I make in Public but rivetts the Chains of those unhappy Beings whose Passion it is impossible not to pity, tho' it is out of my power to return. In short my Dear Charlotte it is my sensibility for the sufferings of so many amiable young Men, my Dislike of the extreme admiration I meet with, and my aversion to being so celebrated both in Public, in Private, in Papers, and in Printshops, that are the reasons why I cannot more fully enjoy, the Amusements so various and pleasing of London. How often have I wished that I possessed as little Personal Beauty as you do; that my figure were as inelegant; my face as unlovely; and my appearance as unpleasing as yours! But ah! what little chance is there of so desirable an Event; I have had the small-pox, and must therefore submit to my unhappy fate.

I am now going to intrust you my dear Charlotte with a secret which has long disturbed the tranquility of my days, and which is of a kind to require the most inviolable Secrecy from you. Last Monday se'night Matilda and I accompanied Lady Lesley to a Rout at the Honourable Mrs Kickabout's; we were escorted by Mr Fitzgerald who is a very amiable young Man in the main, tho' perhaps a little singular in his Taste—He is in love with Matilda—. We had scarcely paid our Compliments to the Lady of the House and curtseyed to half a score different people when my Attention was attracted by the appearance of a Young Man the most lovely of his Sex, who at that moment entered the Room with another Gentleman and Lady. From the first moment I beheld him, I was certain that on him depended the future Happiness of my Life. Imagine my surprise when he was introduced to me by the name of Cleveland—I instantly recognised him as the Brother of Mrs Marlowe, and the acquaintance of my Charlotte at Bristol. Mr and Mrs M. were the gentleman and Lady who accompanied him. (You do not think Mrs Marlowe handsome?) The elegant address of Mr Cleveland, his polished Manners and Delightful Bow, at once confirmed my attachment. He did not speak; but I can imagine everything he would have said, had he opened his Mouth. I can picture to myself the cultivated Understanding, the Noble sentiments, and elegant Language which would have shone so conspicuous in the conversation of Mr Cleveland. The approach of Sir James Gower (one of my too numerous admirers) prevented the Discovery of any such Powers, by putting an end to a Conversation we had never commenced, and by attracting my attention to himself. But oh! how inferior are the accomplishments of Sir James to those of his so greatly envied Rival! Sir James is one of the most frequent of our Visitors, and is almost always of our Parties. We have since often met Mr and Mrs Marlowe but no Cleveland—he is always engaged some where else. Mrs Marlowe fatigues me to Death every time I see her by her tiresome Conversations about you and Eloisa. She is so stupid! I live in the hope of seeing her irrisistable Brother to night, as we are going to Lady Flambeaus, who is I know intimate with the Marlowes. Our party will be Lady Lesley, Matilda, Fitzgerald, Sir James Gower, and myself. We see little of Sir George, who is almost always at the gaming-table. Ah! my poor Fortune where art thou by this time? We see more of Lady L. who always makes her appearance (highly rouged) at Dinner-time. Alas! what Delightful Jewels will she be decked in this evening at Lady Flambeau's! Yet I wonder how she can herself delight in wearing them; surely she must be sensible of the ridiculous impropriety of loading her little diminutive figure with such superfluous ornaments; is it possible that she can not know how greatly superior an elegant simplicity is to the most studied apparel? Would she but Present them to Matilda and me, how greatly should we be obliged to her, How becoming would Diamonds be on our fine majestic figures! And how surprising it is that such an Idea should never have occurred to HER. I am sure if I have reflected in this manner once, I have fifty times. Whenever I see Lady Lesley dressed in them such reflections immediately come across me. My own Mother's Jewels too! But I will say no more on so melancholy a subject—let me entertain you with something more pleasing—Matilda had a letter this morning from Lesley, by which we have the pleasure of finding that he is at Naples has turned Roman-Catholic, obtained one of the Pope's Bulls for annulling his 1st Marriage and has since actually married a Neapolitan Lady of great Rank and Fortune. He tells us moreover that much the same sort of affair has befallen his first wife the worthless Louisa who is likewise at Naples had turned Roman-catholic, and is soon to be married to a Neapolitan Nobleman of great and Distinguished merit. He says, that they are at present very good Freinds, have quite forgiven all past errors and intend in future to be very good Neighbours. He invites Matilda and me to pay him a visit to Italy and to bring him his little Louisa whom both her Mother, Step-mother, and himself are equally desirous of beholding. As to our accepting his invitation, it is at Present very uncertain; Lady Lesley advises us to go without loss of time; Fitzgerald offers to escort us there, but Matilda has some doubts of the Propriety of such a scheme—she owns it would be very agreable. I am certain she likes the Fellow. My Father desires us not to be in a hurry, as perhaps if we wait a few months both he and Lady Lesley will do themselves the pleasure of attending us. Lady Lesley says no, that nothing will ever tempt her to forego the Amusements of Brighthelmstone for a Journey to Italy merely to see our Brother. ""No (says the disagreable Woman) I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family, and I found it did not answer, so Deuce take me, if ever I am so foolish again.""So says her Ladyship, but Sir George still Perseveres in saying that perhaps in a month or two, they may accompany us. Adeiu my Dear Charlotte Yrs faithful Margaret Lesley."

Niggas love to bite the style, but my flow they can not see
Kill MC's they hate like Hitler, cause the flow they can Nazi
God look after me while I face these casualties
Trying to paint a bigger picture coming up with a masterpiece
When the real niggas die, fakes multiply
When the real niggas live, fakes bound to die
Yeah but life ain't what it seems Visionary MLK
But guess it was all a dream
Cause they don't want to see you make it
Got to make it any means

Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

Basin Street is the street
Where the best folks always meet
In New Orleans, land of dreams

Or just how much it really means

4433,"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you! (Applause.) All right, everybody have a seat. Have a seat. You're making me blush. (Laughter.)

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!

THE PRESIDENT: I love you back. Thank you. (Applause.)

Cecile, thank you for the warm introduction, and thank you for the outstanding leadership that you’ve shown over the years. You just do a great, great job. (Applause.) I want to thank all of you for the remarkable work that you’re doing day in, day out in providing quality health care to women all across America. You are somebody that women — young women, old women, women in between — count on for so many important services. And we are truly grateful to you.

I'm sorry that I could not be at the party yesterday. I understand it was a little wild. (Laughter.) That's what I heard. But as all of you know, obviously, we've gone through a pretty tough week and a half, and I was down in Texas, letting the people of West, Texas know that we all love them and care about them in their time of grieving. (Applause.)

But obviously this is a special national conference, because it’s been nearly a hundred years since the first health clinic of what later would become Planned Parenthood opened its doors to women in Brooklyn. And for nearly a century now, one core principle has guided everything all of you do — that women should be allowed to make their own decisions about their own health. (Applause.) It’s a simple principle.

So what I see in this audience, extraordinary doctors and nurses, and advocates and staff who work tirelessly to keep the doors at health centers all across the country going, then I'm reminded of those very early efforts and all the strides that we've made in subsequent decades. And I also think about the millions of mothers and daughters and wives and sisters, friends and neighbors who walk through those doors every year.

Somewhere there’s a woman who just received a new lease on life because of a screening that you provided that helped catch her cancer in time. Somewhere there’s a woman who’s breathing easier today because of the support and counseling she got at her local Planned Parenthood health clinic. Somewhere there’s a young woman starting a career who, because of you, is able to decide for herself when she wants to start a family. (Applause.)

One in five women in this country has turned to Planned Parenthood for health care. One in five. (Applause.) And for many, Planned Parenthood is their primary source of health care — not just for contraceptive care, but for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and health counseling.

So when politicians try to turned Planned Parenthood into a punching bag, they’re not just talking about you; they’re talking about the millions of women who you serve. And when they talk about cutting off your funding, let’s be clear: They’re talking about telling many of those women, you’re on your own. They’re talking about shutting those women out at a time when they may need it most — shutting off communities that need more health care options for women, not less. (Applause.)

So the fact is, after decades of progress, there’s still those who want to turn back the clock to policies more suited to the 1950s than the 21st century. And they’ve been involved in an orchestrated and historic effort to roll back basic rights when it comes to women’s health.
Forty-two states have introduced laws that would ban or severely limit access to a woman’s right to choose — laws that would make it harder for women to get the contraceptive care that they need; laws that would cut off access to cancer screenings and end educational programs that help prevent teen pregnancy.

In North Dakota, they just passed a law that outlaws your right to choose, starting as early as six weeks, even if a woman is raped. A woman may not even know that she’s pregnant at six weeks. In Mississippi, a ballot initiative was put forward that could not only have outlawed your right to choose, but could have had all sorts of other far-reaching consequences like cutting off fertility treatments, making certain forms of contraception a crime.

That’s absurd. It’s wrong. It’s an assault on women’s rights. And that’s why when the people of Mississippi were given a chance to vote on that initiative, they turned it down. (Applause.) Mississippi is a conservative state, but they wanted to make clear there’s nothing conservative about the government injecting itself into decisions best made between a woman and her doctor. And folks are trying to do this all across the country.

When you read about some of these laws, you want to check the calendar; you want to make sure you’re still living in 2013. (Laughter.)

Forty years after the Supreme Court affirmed a woman’s constitutional right to privacy, including the right to choose, we shouldn’t have to remind people that when it comes to a woman’s health, no politician should get to decide what’s best for you. No insurer should get to decide what kind of care that you get. The only person who should get to make decisions about your health is you. (Applause.) That’s why we fought so hard to make health care reform a reality. (Applause.)

That principle is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Because of the ACA, most insurance plans are now covering the cost of contraceptive care, so that a working mom doesn’t have to put off the care she needs just so she can pay her bills on time. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 47 million women have new access to preventive care like mammograms and cancer screenings with no copay, no deductible, no out-of-pocket costs, so they don’t have to put off a mammogram just because money is tight. Because of the Affordable Care Act, young people under the age of 26 can now stay on their parent’s health care plan.

And insurance companies soon will no longer be able to deny you coverage based on preexisting conditions like breast cancer, or charge you more just because you are a woman. Those days are ending. (Applause.) Those days are ending. (Applause.)

Now, I know how hard you worked to help us pass health care reform. You and your supporters got out there — you organized; you mobilized; you made your voices heard. It made all the difference. But here’s the thing — if Americans don’t know how to access the new benefits and protections that they’re going to receive as we implement this law, then health care reform won’t make much of a difference in their lives.

So I’m here to also ask for your help, because we need to get the word out. We need you to tell your patients, your friends, your neighbors, your family members what the health care law means for them. Make sure they know that if they don’t have health insurance, they’ll be able to sign up for quality, affordable insurance starting this fall in an online marketplace where private insurers will compete for their business. Make sure that they know that there are plans out there right now that cover the cost of contraceptive and preventive care free of charge.

We’ve got to spread the word, particularly among women, particularly among young women, who are the ones who are most likely to benefit from these laws. We need all the women who come through your doors telling their children, their husbands, and the folks in their neighborhoods about their health care options. We need all the college students who come through your doors to call up their friends and post on Facebook talking about the protections and benefits that are kicking in.

And you are all in a unique position to deliver that message, because the women you serve know you and they trust you. And the reason for that is that you haven’t let them down before.

I know it’s not always easy. As Cecile described, Planned Parenthood as the only organization that she’s ever been at where there are opponents who, in her words, “literally got up every day trying to figure out how to keep us from doing our work.” Now, if she had worked in the administration — (laughter and applause) — she’d be more familiar with this phenomenon. (Laughter and applause.) But when it comes to your patients, you never let them down — no matter what.

And that’s because you never forget who this is all about. This is about a woman from Chicago named Courtney who has a disease that can leave women infertile. So in college, she turned to Planned Parenthood for access to affordable contraceptive care to keep her healthy. You didn’t just help her plan for a family; you made sure she could start one. And today, she's got two beautiful kids. That’s what Planned Parenthood is about. (Applause.)
This is about a woman in Washington State named Joyce who for years could only afford health care at her local Planned Parenthood clinic. And heeding your advice, she never missed her annual exam. During one of them, your doctors helped catch an aggressive form of cervical cancer early enough to save her life. Today, she's been cancer-free for 25 years. (Applause.)

So every day, in every state, in ever center that Planned Parenthood operates, there are stories like those — lives you've saved, women you've empowered, families that you've strengthened. That’s why, no matter how great the challenge, no matter how fierce the opposition, if there’s one thing the past few years have shown, it's that Planned Parenthood is not going anywhere. It's not going anywhere today. It's not going anywhere tomorrow. (Applause.)

As long as we've got to fight to make sure women have access to quality, affordable health care, and as long as we've got to fight to protect a woman's right to make her own choices about her own health, I want you to know that you've also got a President who's going to be right there with you fighting every step of the way. (Applause.)

Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you."

I wanna be yours
Be yours more so I don't have to be mine
I wanna see myself be enough
For the rest of my life
Lacking something major
We all know what was wasn't
I beseech you listen up
Even if it don't apply

[Verse 2]
You're the screaming
Screaming when my throat runs dry
I'm behind your turnaround
Not sure who's the buzz
And who's the ground
Who we supposed to hear it from
Who's got it in 'em to tell us
Don't fixate on the broken
Deceive myself every time I try
[Verse 3]
Hide and seek you
You're just waiting to be caught, to be found
Let me be your feet on the ground
Be your safe and sound
I wanna see you get angry
The war's waiting for my word
Remember me
Remember me

[Outro]
I'm deceiving
Telling fire it's water
I'm diseased
I'd stay as far away from me as I can
I just want to be enough
Nothing kills me like the sound of your name
I beseech you
How can you still believe you're not enough"

Back in resorting to one remedy
It'll bring you up when life drags you down
Euphoric times with hints and rhymes
It's a volatile game we all play
3 A.M feels like 3 P.M
Tension seems muss less to others
You can feel it in your soul you know?


Come on focus what is it now?
Who's that lover that lives in town?
We've all got pains don't go insane


Forget the one across the way
The clock is falling
You only listen in on a tune that's calling


Come on focus what is it now?
No more distractions around
We've all got pains don't go insane
Don't go insane"

A curse that we here now rehearse in Philadelphia
A second flood, a simple famine
Plagues of locusts everywhere
Or a cataclysmic earthquake
I'd accept with some despair

But no, you sent us Congress
Good God, sir, was that fair?

I say this with humility in Philadelphia
We're your responsibility in Philadelphia

From some far-off British hill
If you don't want the voice of independency
Forever still

They may sit here for years and years in Philadelphia
These indecisive grenadiers of Philadelphia
They can't agree on what is right and wrong
Or what is good or bad
I'm convinced the only purpose this Congress ever had
Was to gather here specifically to drive John Adams mad

6281,"There are tons of peels on the market.  Which ones are safe for at-home use?
Glycolic-acid based peels are safe. Stay away from anything else, even if you find it on the internet, because they are often too harsh and if you use them incorrectly, you can scar your skin! The beauty of glycolic acid peels is that even if you use a preparation that is too strong, the worst that can happen is some irritation - no permanent scarring. That said, you want to start with a relatively mild peel that are oftеn around 30% buffered glycolic peels, perhaps with somе salicylic acid as well, or kojic. On TheSkinRegime.com website, I list several reputable companies that sell glycolic peels in the 30%-70% range, and would also advise asking for sample sizes.

How do you use a peel?
Follow the instructions carefully! Generally, a peel company will try to sell you on special pre-peel lotions and after-peel ""neutralizers,"" but you don't really need them for glycolic peels - you can use plain old rubbing alcohol for the pre-peel, and gentle soap to wash it off.

What can I expect after a peel?
Perhaps a little redness that goes away after an hour or two, then glowing skin. If you use a mild peel, you probably won't flake, but the great benefits of glycolic is still happening.

Is it easy?
Beyond easy. Total time: five to ten minutes.

How often can I use a peel?
Every seven to fourteen days, for a total of 6 to 8 peels. You do not want to do them year-around and end of with over-exfoliated skin: that can lead to fragile skin prone to acne or other infections.

I want to know much more, I have so many questions!

I'm high as a swallow
And I’m swift as a starling
I'm fast as an emu
And as rabid as a hawk
We're gonna talk, and talk, and talk and talk
And darling

Let's rack some lines up, make them disappear
This is Tetris for me and for you, my dear

Now, my score gets high almost every weekend
And my body is fucked
And my mind’s on a bend
Faster and faster, my pieces, they fall
And I can't keep up, I can't keep up at all

So, let's rack some lines up and make them disappear
This is Tetris for me and for you, my dear

Now, maybe, one day, it will all get too much
I'll have played for so long
I'll be all out of touch
But, until that day, I've got Tetris to play
So, I'll be on my way
Yes, I'll be on my way
So, darling, let's rack some lines up and make them disappear
‘Cause this is Tetris"

My brain is on a new wavelength
I think I finally started trying
But I don't know if I have the strength
Even though I'm not afraid of dying
My thoughts fly around me, slowly bend
But I'm turning blue when I blush
I hope I see you at the end
Welcome to my headrush

I don’t know
I don’t know
I don’t know
I dont my know
Things are strange
Around here
People change
Around here



I don’t know if leaving
Was the best decision
But to me it’s like
Finding the key
To freedom
And locking it in my car
I’m having to break the windows
And this was only a rental
Still wondering if I’ll need em
In the long run
We lost sons
Like the moons out
We dodge a bullet
But we still in a shoot out
Willing to lose our lives
Do or die
We were made for this
Even I prayed to god for safety
And I’m aethist
Life is like the upside down
One moment
Love and friends around
The next minute your by your self
And you screaming
You call for help
But the world has just gone to hell
So you lost and feel so alone
We hated being by ourself
Friends
They always help
Even when I’m afraid
Of my own shadow
They come to battle
With me
When I drowning
They arm paddle
Lift my spirits up
With
Telekinesis
That’s just the thesis
We won the battle
But the wars coming in pieces
They called us kids
Say we can’t understand
Fair play is
Not playing fair
Like soft ball
The way to win
Is pitching it underhand
We can do this
No excuses
Put my face on the plan
Cause I’m planning to face the music
And even if we change
Nothing is the same
But I’m steady scrounging for change
Just to hit the arcade
Cause these women
Keep playing games
So I’m tryna get some practice in
Leader boarding my name
Keep the door shut
There’s a monster in there
It can smell all your fears
Taste the tension in air
It wants to swallow your pride
It wants to eat you alive

So run
Run run
Faster than you ever have
Don’t get caught"
8843,"Sat around and thought about destiny
Which led me to feelings I could not conceive
Because I was holding on to yesterday
Had to let go to find today

Do do do, you're breaking through my boundaries
Do do do, the many moons it took me to find you
Do do do, do do do, you're burning through
I want to fall in love with you

Sat around and talked about politics
And all the different reasons why we exist
But what if the answer is right in front of me
Turning these pages?

Do do do, you're breaking through my boundaries
Do do do, the many moons it took me to find you
Do do do, Do do do, you're burning through
I want to fall in love with you

It's taken me over
It's taken him over
I'm thinking it over
Do do do, you're breaking through my boundaries
Do do do, the many moons it took me to find you
Do do do, Do do do, you're burning through
I want to fall in love with you"
592,"My body started rotting away
From the day I was grown
Oh I've always known
There'll never be a home
That's cold enough for me

All the lovers that have been
In my heart and on my skin
Left a mark deeper than
Any depth that man
Has ever seen

We are made of lesser materials
Our bones will one day break
But I witness something ethereal
In every move you make

While our looks they fade away
Our memories remain
So as long as you know my name
It'll all be okay
'Cause I know that you'll never fade
And while the price we pay is great
For the freedom to create
It'll last longer than
Any break or bend
That our bodies can take

We are made of lesser materials
Our bones will one day break
But I witness something ethereal
In every move you make

(Instrumental Break)

We are made of lesser materials
Our bones will one day break
But I witness something ethereal
In every move you make
We are made of lesser materials
Our bones will one day break
But I witness something ethereal

I'm so tired
Waking up this early
And going to a place I don't belong
I'm so tired
Of painting on a grin
So I take another shot in my medicine

On second thought
I could work on a bank or I could
Put on a suit or sell fancy rings
But what I want is for you to feel the same
That it's alright, it's alright to chase a dream

[Verse 2]
I'm so worried
Is the universe against me
Will I be alive among the star
And I'm so worried
I left my town with my friends and family
Will they ever know what's feeling in my heart
[Chorus 2]
On second thought
I could always catch a train back to my hometown and just
Give a phone, everything
But what I want is for you to feel the same
That it's alright, it's alright to chase a dream

[Verse 3]
Oh I don't want to be where I don't belong
I don't want to live a life that's wrong
We were born to live
So I live before I die
I'ma chase this dream as I come alive
Alright

[Chorus 3]
On second
I can open a bottle
Open, bring and find love at the bottom
What I want is for you
Pour it down the drain
That it's alright, it's alright to chase a dream
Tell me it's alright, it's alright to chase a dream"

If starlight is an echo
How far to the surface?
Just because we wanted more
I’ve been on it from the get go
Now I wonder was it worth it
When we are the last to know

What did they see in the shadow of a black hole?
When they find out, will we wanna know?
What was there when they looked through the telescope?
What’s there to find in the shadow of a black hole?
No light, no sound, no matter overflowing
Hold a mirror to the dark night of my soul

If starlight is an echo
Will we rise to the surface?
On and on, we’re on a roll
We're on it all over it
Like a dam in overflow
We're in the corner of a black hole

First off I wanna start by saying RIP Deppy (RIP brother)
And any other MC that has been buried, Lukey, Esco, any
Can't keep going because there's too many
Man are getting killed over pennies
Man are getting killed over breadcrumbs
Tears in my cup of Henny like Skepta
Way too many snakes move friendly
Jet ski wave but the tide is getting rough
And the tank is too empty. Sneakbo, he know it
Shit gets peak but we keep going
Know what it's like when the pain ain't going
A real man'll feel your pain when you show it
The feeling's too familiar I seem to know it
Mind's strolling, weed-blowing fucked up my day
I was high through the whole thing
But we don't buy weed no we grow it
Man can never die as long as there's street poets
Fuck growing up man, I'm glowing
Alcohol flowing, top down it's snowing
Singing why's it always got to be the best ones
Ain't about mine when death comes
Dead or in pen, that's where I ain't gonna end up
Living in the South East Kent, I'm feeling like
I'm living in something that's similar to EastEnders
So close to the drama, fuck that film Offender
I'm more than an extra, I'm in the streets going extra
Always got to get one extra
Mad out here the setting's real messed up
Then I'm getting spun on 1Xtra
(""Yo it's mad! And I swear yeah, anyone in the ends that's shotting food to my Dad I swear you're getting jacked, on my life you're getting jacked"")

Since SBTV times that's me right there
Getting all deep when my fade was weak
Now it's peak man need my hair
Damn Mic where you been out here?
Blowing Tangerine Dream in the air
There's crowing casualties over-reacting screams
Know that that was me, been everywhere
No I actually mean everywhere
I've been in care, been in a special needs class in school
With the kids that were in the wheelchair
In a way I feel like I am still there
'Cos I ain't going anywhere, man are never scared
Fuck your career, it's Mic's year every year
You don't want to fight me 'cos that ain't very fair
I'll punch a man and leave claret everywhere
Then drop a Jaykae ad-lib ""Oh Yeah!""
Too honest, can't cock-block me I'm too on it
Spin an emcee no matter who want it
Been off for a hot minute
Bros are like ""When's it gonna be your time Rocks?
Seeing you do well is all I've got.""
Damn fam that's too honest
Big nosed Arab with an even bigger dick
Still fuck your chick on a car bonnet (Ah stop it)
Too real, can't knock it
And if we're on the same track and your verse is whack
Tell Tone to take his bars off it  (Haha, ah stop it)
Too honest, you don;t want it with the kid

Wen I pull up on your street
I can’t see you on my street
Cause you ain’t on it

[Chorus]
I been tryna run it outside
Why you keep on actin' like you mine
Shorty you a waste of my time
And you know this
Cause I ain’t hear from you
Since 9
Wiping my nose like a slime
Shorty I made you a dime
But now it’s over wit
[Verse 1]
Now it’s fuckin' over
We can’t talk to each other
Ugh
Glad I ain’t let you meat my momma
Or my brother
Ugh
I been waisting time
Time to move on past this life
Leave you all in my past
I can’t worry bout you now
I been grinding grinding grinding
I don't wanna talk to you
Fuck that relationship shit
I am all about my future
I ain’t tryna be friends
For a reason was amends
I don’t picture you with me
I can’t see you through these lens
I can’t see you through these lens
Girl you had me goin' crazy
Mest up in my head
Never thought of leaving baby
All up on my mind
All the scenes with you lately
Tell me why you do this
Every time this is crazy
Yea
And I still stood wit you
You ain’t never had a nigga
Who jus wanted you for you
Yea
And it’s crazy how it’s not your fault
But you the main one entertaining
All these thots
[Chorus]
I been tryna run it outside
Why you keep on actin' like you mine
Shorty you a waste of my time
And you know this
Cause I ain’t hear from you
Since 9
Wiping my nose like a slime
Shorty I made you a dime
But now it’s over wit

[Verse 2]
I ain’t even tell you
Had a girl on the side
Messing with her
While you playing with my time
On the weekend
I will be chillin with her
While you sitting back
Like where am I
Like What am I doin'
Where am I goin
Tell me why this girl
Won’t ever stop hoeing
Why am I still here
If everybody left
Lord why you put me in this
Motherfuckin' mess
Why you put me in this mess
If you knew the outcome
Now in the future me and girls
I can’t love none
Shorty kind of sad
Cause I left and I’m not lookin' back
Don’t know why she mad
Cause she cheated
I got all the facts
Yea
And I’m riding round town
Hope I never see her
If I do she gonna frown
And just listen to the sound
The sound of the mic
Wen the mic hits the ground
Thought u was mine
Thought you was mine
Yeah
Ugh huh
And I really wanted u
Yea
You wasted of my time
Yea
You a waste of my time
[Chorus]
I been tryna run it outside
Why you keep on actin' like you mine
Shorty you a waste of my time
And you know this
Cause I ain’t hear from you

Broke spines and every artist tryna spit it like tech nine
Q and i chill in the studio relaxed and recline
I was never born more designed
And listen close and if u can't understand press rewind
Cuz I'm rippin the game you nighas slack with every record y'all contract

Got the children in love with the music so much cops tryna arrest it
In this bitch double breasted
All the time I spent in the game now it's invested
The beat molested now i need consuling
More crack verses then 2 chainz in public housing
I do it biggie no biggie
Out the park like rigley

Bang giggy bang
Duwop with the slang
Word round tw city hybrid is making it crazy
Fat kid big titties act lazy
But his verses so mean just ask that Harry potter pictured fat lady
He realizing every new artist flow ass lately
Bang these nighas Is lame
They said I looked like breezy the way I beat the game
And beat U the same
Fine china dinin u ass wipin vaginas
Hangin with my white roots in the woods like moonshiners
They said the choice is mine so I'll leave the beat deceased
Tie it tight and walk with pressured to leave it creased

[Eve:]
This ain't Milli Vanilli
You think we your puppets, that's the difference
We tryna have our own voice heard, but you ain't listening
You so high on your pedestal, thinking you got control of what you let us do
My pen is equally incredible
I'm not just looks, i'm not your pretty lil ornament
It's like Miyagi versus [?], you in the tournament
Supposed to be a Queens thing, but you made it difficult
Supposed to be a team thing, not you individual
So maybe go and get your own deal
Nobody wanna walk in your shoes, baby, we got our own heels

[Brandy:]
Uh-huh, uh
Ayo, first off, Brianna, you not on my level ever
Better go tuck the kids in and tеll 'em why daddy left 'em
Tеll 'em no fairytales and no happily ever after
Tell ya daughter her mother was more stripper than rapper
Let me quiet down to shape up
You always set your place up in this race
But show that model face without that make up
You gave a new meaning to ""around the way girl""
Nasty meant lyrics, not spread your legs to the world
[Eve:]
Okay, okay
You take that, you got that one
Ayo, Eric, gimme something i can bop to

Round 2

[Eve:]
Uh, oh you wanna take it there?
Gloves off, no playing fair
Who's your baby daddy, when you met him?
C'mon, name the year
You too busy shadow boxing in the mirror to be a mom
I can give you pointers but you prolly still will get it wrong
You just got a complex, everything's a contest
Napoleon, more like dynamite, with your bomb threats
I am not the same lil Briana in that prom dress
Who caught you rockin' more than just the mic up in the projects
My mirror on the wall, huh, say I'm Michael Jackson bad
Your mirror off the wall, ugly attitude, breakin' glass
You just wanna whine and complain, drinkin' wine like a wine-o
I'm just tryna shine, ending mine on a high note

[Brandy:]
Every rapper sex toy
You decide to show up now?
Bitin' my style so you can act like the golden child
Always late for interviews, too busy up in a dude
Now you wanna write your rhymes? before money was it for you
If you wasn't pretty, everybody'd be dissin' you
Nobody's missin' you, not a visionary, nothing that you say we wanna listen to
You gotta be lyrical to spit the truth
And I can count the years that i couldn't even get you in the booth
Round 3

[Brandy:]
Ayo, first off Bri, you a mini version of me
And second of all, Jill ain't got the skills to be ill
So me writing your rhymes is a much better design
I started this group, i coulda left your ass behind
When my pen hit the pad it's on top of the charts
And now, just like your marriage, you want us to fall apart
It's jealousy and i can't even say it any clearer
You spendin' too much time in the mirror
You tryna be the mommy or a don, you a copy and a fraud
You Johnny, I'll be Bobby, my new edition is strong
So run along Tyra, we can't Bank on you
And a leader, we can't put that rank on you

[Eve:]
Ayo, stop the beat, I'ma go off top
It's called growth and maturity, you stuck in the past
A insecure scared little girl, now i'm spankin' that ass
This is a wake up call, we ain't here to go tit-for-tat
Nasty bitches is in our image, we no longer livin' like that
But I get it, you did it to sell records, now the gimmick is done
Pullin' the wool over the people and critics like Xplicit's the only one
We 'bout to re-write our own stories and make the narrative change
To show to whole world we real Queens, not embarrassed and ashamed
My marriage has nothing to do with the stardom and fame
I honor the pain, and use it to be a Goddess and slaughter the game
All artists that gold, ain't tarnished, I'm polished and heavy
My knowledge is deadly, lyrically a problem, I'll demolish your petty
The lesson your taught me was win, and I'ma win for the crew
To teach you the lesson that everything ain't all about you"

Can you feel the heat in your mind all the time
You don't have to find the effect of the
Rhythm in a funky rhyme on your body
On your gear so have no fear in your hair
Everywhere if you could dare take this never
Miss that funky list of super rockin' cuts

You enticed my anger with violence
I laugh
Then stare at you in silence
Without notice, I STRIKE
Now I'm hearing sirens
But this is what happens when David meets Goliath
Muhammad meets Tyson
You played the victim
I was just a villain
You took my life away
That's a fact, not just how I'm feeling
You showed no remorse
But that's okay…
I'm moving on
To the next one…
But I can't give em no love
Cuz you left none
Every day a struggle, a battle, a conflict
I'm fighting myself
Destroying my health
Looking around
But there is no one else
Only brotherly love, no homo
Am I sick or twisted?
I don't know
But I need a new motto
No longer peddle to the metal, full throttle
It's Music over EVERYTHING
Moving on to better things
Losing you gave me self improvement
Regained my love for music
But we are not a...simple equation
I talk with abrasion
Guess I'll never be patient
Our marriage was sacred
But it slowly degraded
Is this the end of relations?
Or is there a chance that we can save it?
Are we just creatures of habit?
Sticking around when relationships shatter
I'm watching you bleed but my emotions are scattered
I internally scream
Is this the end of Hip Hop
Or is it only a dream?
Like I heard from B.I.G
The answer unseen
But I know that she's dying
With all the nonsense we let slide in
So this is my State of the Union
Nation in ruins
Can we switch up our motives
And regain our focus
Or are we chasing the quotas?
For those who don't know this
They Call me Micnificent
I'm a disgruntled citizen
To the Hip Hop nation we living in
Our elected officials are only half listening
But I'm actually hearing it
Searching for lyricists
But they slowly diminish
As God is my witness
I'm done with this business
Don't try to stop me I'm finished
I wish I could say I'll be back
But I ain't leaving
Just taking my talents elsewhere
Like Lebron did Cleveland
In the end...
I guess I'm just another brick in the wall"
2855,"I cannot possibly do better than Zeynep Tufekci in taking two journalists -- New York Times columnist and former executive editor Bill Keller and his wife, Guardian writer Emma Keller -- to school in a brilliant post that explains how each exploited and offended, misinterpreted and mistreated a mother who they think is doing too much and saying too much about her cancer. Please, please go read that now.

I will address only one matter myself: blogging and tweeting -- or as we used to say, talking about -- disease.

I will readily tell you about my prostate cancer and consequently malfunctioning penis, about my thyroid cancer, about the atrial fibrillation that came after I sucked in the dust of destruction at the World Trade Center, and while I'm at it, I might as well add a note about my bursitis.

I don't do this because I am a hypochondriac or want an ounce of sympathy -- I deserve none as I have had cancer lite, with no chemo, no radiation, only momentary pain or inconvenience, and most importantly, no mortal threat. I don't do this to take part in what my elderly parents living in a community of elderly friends call ""the organ recital.""

I do this because I gain support and information and because I can give others support and information. I do this because I believe we must talk about about sickness, openly and honestly, to rob it of its stigma, to pool what we know about it, to teach people about it, to influence policy about it.

And why shouldn't we? It's just disease. It happens to all of us, except those who come to violent ends. Imagine a world in which there is no stigma about illness, in which ailments are not a matter of privacy or lost insurance or jobs, in which we collectively share and learn as much as we can about what afflicts us so it can afflict fewer. It's just data.

So I am astounded that two journalists who should support transparency as a virtue come to question the ethics of Lisa Adams for talking about her disease. It is her disease. It is her motives that matter, generously trying to educate people about her treatment. How dare a journalist of all people try to tell someone what she cannot say? How could a journalist seek less information in the world?

When I blogged about my prostate cancer, one and only one guy -- who didn't like me anyway -- similarly complained that I was saying too much. He accused me of oversharing. I said the problem is not that. It's that he was overlistening.

If Emma Keller doesn't want to read about Lisa Adams' cancer, then she shouldn't read it. If Bill Keller thinks Adams should not treat her cancer and her pain, well, he should mind his own business.

But if they do want to act as journalists in this new age, then they must follow Tufekci's advice and learn that when they read someone's words, they are not interacting with media, they are interacting with a person. It so happens the person they were writing about is brave and generous. They were not.

And we all should be welcoming the opportunity to hear more voices, learn more perspectives, gain more information. And we should all be wishing Lisa Adams our best for what she is going through and what she is offering us."
6995,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in between years, come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say, but if you let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way

I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

[Verse: Lil Nas X]
I'm a problem, niggas know 'dat
Hop out, grab the black MAC, no Kodak
Rockstar like Jack Black, I'm playing like Mick Jagg
No playing, get rich fast, then sit back
Huh, soak it all in
I spoke it, now it's happening, they hope it all end
Niggas rather hate than get in they own bag
It's funny because I always put money over that mad shit
Tell me, tell me, what that fuck you gaining from it?
Hating while I'm in the club and it's raining money
That shit is draining you, paining your fucking brain, and you
Straining yourself out, tryna get all that clout off my name

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]
They in they feelings
They don't want they spot, nigga, I fill in
I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

I feel it coming, I'm running to get my thrill in
I'm sonning these pussy niggas, I'm coming to make a killing

I'm looking for a girl
I'm changing the channels
She's changing my world

I'm dancing alone
Without any friends
She's out on the dance floor
She's dancing with a man

I want to ask her to dance with me
But she can't see me cuz

She's just a video girl

I'm creeping around
The club at night
I bought a drink
On ladies night

I look for the girl
I saw on TV
I want to see her
Look back at me

I think she might be here tonight
But no one knows because

She's just a video girl

She's the girl that's meant for me tonight
I don't wanna dance, dance alone
I wanna find her now and take her home
Take her home
And dance alone

I try to sleep
But the video girl is looking back at me

I get out of bed
I look at the stars
I turn on the radio
They're playing The Cars!!! (fuck yeah)

If I don't get it all or nothing
That's what I'm expecting from you
Cause I don't want to be left with nothing
That is the day I will rue
It seems like you don't have a clue
Like you're trying not to keep it true
But fuck the assumptions, let's get to loving
Keeping it real, girl you know how I feel
Tryna reach you, let's be see-through, let's keep it trill
Just keeping it real, girl you know how I feel
Wouldn't leave ya, you know I need ya
You know the deal oh

You've gotta say something, the silence is insulting
It's like you don't feel nothing, I'm the only one trying
The only one dying, only one fighting
For something that's realer than the cheating and lying
You'll see in no time, the timing is not right
When it's time to hit it, I split it, I flip it and I beat it so right
In the rivers I row like
And I pray for low lights
Especially when we pour it right
Keep you warm on this cold night

[Verse 2: CrownedYung]
At times I drift off back to better days
When we were still younger and never lied
Our hearts always prayed we don't sever ties
Growing up they saved me hella times
Nowadays I'm seeing hella change
Us versus them on the tennis side
Got the kid in me wreaking and petrified
Still I'm grateful that I'm on the clever side
Forever slide, keep it memorised
Ready to love but desensitised
They broke you down, ate your soul, threw you out
And you came back to me truly dead inside
And I gave you life golden melon size
Happy you learnt how to exercise
The truth like our case had been televised
To the bitches I stay Hellen Keller tight
Whose better than Yung?
Came to build off the shit that they flung
Held your weave when you threw up all drunk
Kept it G with the silver-est time, better recognise
These are the legends of telling time
As long as they say that there is mine
Set up a trap then we fell inside
Now it seems you want out
Why you quiet?
[Outro: Tellaman]
You've gotta say something, the silence is insulting
It's like you don't feel nothing, I'm the only one trying
The only one dying, only one fighting
For something that's realer than the cheating and lying"
1053,"Evolution
Langdon Smith (1858-1908)

When you were a tadpole and I was a fish
 In the Paleozoic time,
And side by side on the ebbing tide
 We sprawled through the ooze and slime,
Or skittered with many a caudal flip
 Through the depths of the Cambrian fen,
My heart was rife with the joy of life,
 For I loved you even then.

Mindless we lived and mindless we loved
 And mindless at last we died;
And deep in the rift of the Caradoc drift
 We slumbered side by side.
The world turned on in the lathe of time,
 The hot lands heaved amain,
Till we caught our breath from the womb of death
 And crept into life again.
We were amphibians, scaled and tailed,
 And drab as a dead man's hand;
We coiled at ease 'neath the dripping trees
 Or trailed through the mud and sand.
Croaking and blind, with our three-clawed feet
 Writing a language dumb,
With never a spark in the empty dark
 To hint at a life to come.

Yet happy we lived and happy we loved,
 And happy we died once more;
Our forms were rolled in the clinging mold
 Of a Neocomian shore.
The eons came and the eons fled
 And the sleep that wrapped us fast
Was riven away in a newer day
 And the night of death was passed.

Then light and swift through the jungle trees
 We swung in our airy flights,
Or breathed in the balms of the fronded palms
 In the hush of the moonless nights;
And oh! what beautiful years were there
 When our hearts clung each to each;
When life was filled and our senses thrilled
 In the first faint dawn of speech.
Thus life by life and love by love
 We passed through the cycles strange,
And breath by breath and death by death
 We followed the chain of change.
Till there came a time in the law of life
 When over the nursing sod
The shadows broke and the soul awoke
 In a strange, dim dream of God.

I was thewed like an Auroch bull
 And tusked like the great cave bear;
And you, my sweet, from head to feet
 Were gowned in your glorious hair.
Deep in the gloom of a fireless cave,
 When the night fell o'er the plain
And the moon hung red o'er the river bed
 We mumbled the bones of the slain.

I flaked a flint to a cutting edge
 And shaped it with brutish craft;
I broke a shank from the woodland lank
 And fitted it, head and haft;
Than I hid me close to the reedy tarn,
 Where the mammoth came to drink;
Through the brawn and bone I drove the stone
 And slew him upon the brink.
Loud I howled through the moonlit wastes,
 Loud answered our kith and kin;
From west to east to the crimson feast
 The clan came tramping in.
O'er joint and gristle and padded hoof
 We fought and clawed and tore,
And cheek by jowl with many a growl
 We talked the marvel o'er.

I carved that fight on a reindeer bone
 With rude and hairy hand;
I pictured his fall on the cavern wall
 That men might understand.
For we lived by blood and the right of might
 Ere human laws were drawn,
And the age of sin did not begin
 Til our brutal tusks were gone.

And that was a million years ago
 In a time that no man knows;
Yet here tonight in the mellow light
 We sit at Delmonico's.
Your eyes are deep as the Devon springs,
 Your hair is dark as jet,
Your years are few, your life is new,
 Your soul untried, and yet --

Our trail is on the Kimmeridge clay
 And the scarp of the Purbeck flags;
We have left our bones in the Bagshot stones
 And deep in the Coralline crags;
Our love is old, our lives are old,
 And death shall come amain;
Should it come today, what man may say
 We shall not live again?

God wrought our souls from the Tremadoc beds
 And furnish’d them wings to fly;
He sowed our spawn in the world's dim dawn,
 And I know that it shall not die,
Though cities have sprung above the graves
 Where the crook-bone men made war
And the ox-wain creaks o'er the buried caves
 Where the mummied mammoths are.

Then as we linger at luncheon here
 O'er many a dainty dish,
Let us drink anew to the time when you
 Were a tadpole and I was a fish."
2879,"Don't care too much 'bout destruction
Just care that my body won't function
Straight to the point, to the point, I'm vacant
Whipping MCs like a pound of bacon

Go crazy when I hear a cymbal
High-hat or a souped-up tempo
Back beat and Deliah

Playing air guitar when the place shook over
I'll play air guitar when the place shook over
I'll play air guitar when the place shook over

It's not hard to find confrontation
When you've got a bad reputation
I wanna' piece, a piece of the action
'Cause I need my satisfaction

When twelve o'clock comes around then
I'll just be chasing a car down
Can't you see my hair touch the ceiling?
I wanna' roll, time to go rolling
I'll play air guitar when the place shook over
Take me away to the place that's in your eyes
It's not far away, just one step from paradise

I played air guitar and the place shook over
Take me away to the place that's in your eyes
It's not far away, just one step from paradise

I played air guitar and the place shook over
I played air guitar and the place shook over
I played air guitar and the place shook over"

If you saying you married to the game and carrying caine
I wanna let you bitches know that I am very insane
And I will bury you lames, you think you scaring me, may-
Be you wanna just pick your shit up and prepare a new lane
And get out of this rap shit, find a new address

Pull a knife out somebody's body, stick it right in your buddy

Listen so you can hear me, I'm sicker than a venereal
Picture a bitch hysterically itching at her waist area
That's because of me, disgustingly busting these lyrics up
Now I'm not saying I'm some sort of disease, son
More like the reason all these MC's freezing at the knees and
Staring in toilets, so paranoid that they hear a noise and
Pick up the telephone and yell at homes, ""Yo, where my boys at?""
Then you realize your phone has been disconnected
Then I gouge out your eyes, rip out your bones, you get your neck slit
Then I'll have breakfast with an anorexic, flexible, death chick
She never ate shit so I felt no less than disrespected
I panicked, losed my shit, grabbed her satanic crucifix
Had me on some Lex Luthor shit, hammered, I rammed it through her chest
The waitress walks up, hands us a stupid check
""Damn it, are you legit?"", grabbed her head and I smack the roof with it

[Verse 3]
Am I the crazy one, just 'cause I wanna raise a gun
And blaze you son, for those wack and utterly lazy puns?
Well if so, fuck me, I'm really sorry, bruh
But I'ma still slaughter ya and make sure that the fear of God's in ya
God I feel like a Saudi Arabian with some rabies and
Maybe one day I'll be crazy enough that they wanna pay me and
Eighty-some-thousand people come see me play at a stadium
Raising a generation, disgracing the name's who faking 'cause
Shit's gotta change whether you like it or not
Which by the way, I'm doing even if it might get me shot
Look at my face, I don't give a fuck, squeeze and fire your Glocks
Ain't no reason trying to stop me even if I die, I'ma pop
So hold your tongue, the soldier's come so you're over, done
Just as you go to run I showed a gun and you froze up, son
I threw it away and punched you in the face

My trust was cheated
I almost gave my soul away
Friends turned to demons
Girlfriends talked of suicide
Who do I believe in
Wide awake
Still Dreamin'
Reality's Deceivin' me
To break these chains
That hold me here
I must rise and face these fears
This constant struggle
I find myself defending
Is what I call my life
Take hold of this rage
And give me what I know is right
Light a fire so I can see
This inner silence
Won't bury me
It's cold in this heart
Cause it's so real
There's a cold devise
That pumps this blood
Voices in my head are screamin'
Set yourself free
From these demons
And these hollow souls
That are surrounding me
Trapped in a corner
Back up against the wall
I gotta rise before I fall

Through these veins

Complain me hot, complaining I leave you where no one saw ya

These hoes aren't understanding so I'm punching they nose
Yo, who you messing with slut? I make a mess with ya gut
I rip ya chest out your back and leave you left in the cut

Get your titties out and get to the spot you fucking slut
You better start sucking nuts and fucking guys before I go and fuck you up
Are you hearing me? Stop rolling your eyes like you're having a seizure
I'll beat you and feed you lethal amounts of ether
And choke you with loads of bleach till it eats through your stomach
You little dumb chick, this my money you fucking with
You better respect me if you reject what I'm saying you better come check me
With an AK and blast my brains away
Or take a vacay and never show your face around these parks, okay?

Pay everyone around so they can say they never heard of you

6130,"I'm that little voice inside your head
Look at what you've done to me
You knew all along that you were lying when you said
All those pretty words and lovely things

You'd really like to be let off the hook
Won't somebody scrub your conscience clean?
But that cannot be done, you'll probably need to see a shrink
No, you can't take a pill to silence me

So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection

Your whole life you've done things just like this
No responsibility, no blame
But you can't always get away treatin' people like shit
And expect it won't catch up with you someday

So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me
It was so damn easy for you to cut off your affection
So here I am the object of your rejection
I am your creation
Your the one who trapped me in your brain
Now I'm forced to haunt you
Bet you never thought we'd turn on you this way

So I'll keep talkin' and talkin', I swear I won't give you a moments peace
You'll never again have to look my face, but you'll always hear from me

So here I am the object of your rejection"

This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
Cause we won't, although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change

[Post-Chorus]
You've given me the best of you
But now I need the rest of you

Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back
And have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime
And the aftermath
[Chorus]

I know we've got to move somehow
But I don't want to lose you now

Sometimes it's so easy
To let a day slip on by
Without even seeing each other at all
But this is the time you'll turn back to and so will I
And those will be days you can never recall

And so we embrace again
Behind the dunes
This beach is so cold on winter afternoons
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun
I'm warm from the memory of days to come

And now your walking on such a thin line and I'm about to lose my nerve

And I have wasted too much love and pride to be denied what is mine
Walk away, sell yourself a lie so you can sleep at night and feed the cancer
Rip me wide open, leave me here broken.... GO
This is the last time that I will play the fool and watch you walk all over me
The stories unwind and I'm about to lose my nerve
When all of this times cost me so much, now even in the dust, everything we had you threw it away
And I have wasted too much love and pride to be denied what is mine
Walk away, sell yourself a lie so you can sleep at night and feed the cancer
Rip me wide open, leave me here broken
It's better out here away from you, all this time I've seen every sight, believed every lie
I'll be just fine away from you, you, you
This place is just not the same, I'm walking away, I'll be ok away from you, you, you
Walk away, sell yourself a lie so you can sleep at night and feed the cancer
Rip me wide open, leave me here
Just walk away and leave me here behind, how can you sleep at night
You feed your cancer, rip me wide open, leave me here broken"

The Recs on my feet show my accomplishments
People steady hating say that I'm arrogant
I deserve the best so yeah I'm high maintenance
The diamonds on my shirt yeah I paid for it

Went from ramen to Osaka covering the payments
I guess you can say I finally made it
I just wanna thank god for keeping me dedicated

Saying Chris is like tyga but bitch you know I'm never fadin
Cause all my verses well done you might as well kitchen plate it
My 16's like the 60's It's got all you niggas hanging
Begging for more like who makes shit like this anymore?
I rhyme crazier than nympho maniacs
When I'm on the mic I induce arrests similar to cardiac
Do I have faith in rap?
Well most of these rappers wack
And most of these, rappers pussies, courage is what they lack
When I'm on the mic I'm under oath I just spit the facts, Because
None of these niggas were here when I started
I'm going real far the sky's my target
You think you the shit but you niggas just farted
You claim you go dumb I go FUTURE retarded
I'm trying to eat and you rappers my harvest
Don't try to battle me, your time will be wasted
Im the rap reverend, you niggas false prophets
F all the hoes who just steady jockin'
How could you hate on someone who came from nothing to somethin'?
That's the definition of Frontin'
DROP
[Hook: Chris InAsong]


[Verse: Chris InAsong]
This verse is dedicated to my relationships that failed
Because I was naiive and felt locked up and bailed
I thought I was a man but I was too young understand
That if you date at the age I am, at least try and see her in your marriage plans
I knew you were a dime piece so instead of showing you love and respectin
I treated you like a possession
That got stolen by a man who knew what he had
I know it sounds sad but don't feel bad
Because even though it made a nigga contemplate depression
I finally understood Childish Gambino's lesson
That even though it's sad, the sadness was my decision
I was to focused on partying and twin city livin
To realize I was losing my beautiful European
So I guess when it came to love I failed the test
But I was too young for love anyway
I just love my Diamonds & Recs

Go wild when he hear snares hitting in the beats
Fuck wit' the bull, get the horn, that’s the steez
In some ways it’s clear he was born to MC
Still don’t sleep, though on beats ya soporific
Give ya the rope-a-dope, then drop it so terrific
Let’s see who committed heresy amongst ya
And ya barely even see what it is he brungst ya

So ya could try hard but never compare
The best is on my team like not coachin’ fair

Posting the movement, postulate the perfection
Propose the bold improvement of method (the insurrection)
Pop peasants, the weapon is my discretion
Compose the cold expression (the poems could pose a threat then)
Get with the coolest
Secular Buddhist
Control these institutions recruitment of youth imprudent
I could hate myself for acting stupid
Back to solutions, dreaming lucid or we' re loosing to illusions bro
Total delusions, pondering on projection
Protect the probe from humans, Aggressive with our possessions
So putrid and petulant, Soul lividly pestilent
Sold CDs (I'm prevalent)
Old artists my preference

Flows deem them preeminent
Whole sessions of evidence
Told lessons that's eminent
No effort still better than
Half yo shit (go resign)
Not the hits that we like
I oughta give out free dimes
That'll make you bee line
Remind those guys 3 time
Free minds sing live and spit rhymes the whole night
(Third Eye)
Show Truman, the fickleness with affection
Afflicted with infidelity, flick it off like infection
Thot pleasant, perfected the intercession
But cloaked in the confession
Obsession with her ascension
Transgressions, regretting all the progression
Direction had been upended, still looking for the concession , her affection
(Verse 2)
Blow mucus, descriptions of the deception.,
No truant, flow smoother than junkies at jazz sessions
Check the method, indebted to all the meth heads
I'm Alphabetically vexing cause I've invested my time
What a line
Spit bars then I Guzzle up the wine
Wheat timberland plundering that's my vibe
I'm Walking 'muddy waters' daily in the Chi'
And all the motherfuckers coming at me die
Cause fucking with the third Eye or one of my guys
Yo that's pretty unwise
Sole proof is my temperament
Hold true to my testament
Old dude (the protectorate)
Told you that I'm tethering
Bad weather (bring sweaters then)
Ask whether that's relevant
Cold measures (expecting em)
Methamphetamine preference

Madness, madness, my music is violence
I say timeless, mine is
Pretty like violets
See my eyelids, sadness lonely like islands
I've been planting, see the myopia they short sighted
My vision getting bigger
Hold it close like a trigger
Trying to get the keys and unlock just like Alicia
Trying to raise the bar and it's looking just like Adidas
Building it brick by brick
And they wonder how to defeat us
They've been plotting, scheming
Stuck in dreams, my pen ain't ever sleeping yo
Verse is healing
Best believing
Light is ultrabeaming
Live a villian, fuck opinions
Done caring for feelings
This lifestyle that I chose is the reason that I'm breathing
Live on through my words
And my soul will pass a message
Verse that grace the Earth will live on for every decade
Curse that made me blessed
That I wear just like a necklace
For those that do oppose
I just write and live em' breathless

I'm stuck on overdrive

I got dreams to be the greatest thing
And that's a do or die
All my dreams to you might be extreme
But it's not for you and I
As I write this, my soul decided that imma fight
Like the knight did I'm dark as night is
Not losing sight
See my eyelids is full of sadness and full of light
So I'm guided through every darkness I don't invite
As I write this, my soul decided that imma fight
Like the knight did I'm dark as night is
Not losing sight
See my eyelids is full of sadness and full of light
So I'm guided through every darkness I don't invite
Every phase I face only creates a better mental space
As I live in grace, I walk a pace that's easily retracted
Every dream I make cannot be shaked
It's been carefully been placed
I don't fuck with snakes
And if you're fake, I'll hit you like a break

3915,"I woke up dreaming that I was asleep
That's the first time in so very long
There was fire in my veins and today I will use it all
My heart, it was beating
My fingers were bleeding
They're playing songs on the radio
Sometimes you don't know why
You just know that you know

Never needed anyone, except myself
I'm using these days I have left
For times I forget

I woke up from the sleeping
It was just like my dreams
And now every word that I said
That came from my mouth
And it makes perfect sense
To the ears on the sides of my head
All these things I didn't do
All these things I didn't do
I will do them
Never needed anyone, except myself
I'm using the time I have left
For the things I forget

Baby, did you like the show?
Did you think he was funny?
Well he totally lost the jokes
You can tell by his hands that he's lonely
Baby are we lonely?
On our way back home
Comes that song by Phil Collins
You were looking for your phone
As you're watching the leaves make tornadoes in the mirror behind the car
Here we are

On the road ahead
Are the lights from the city
It was raining up ahead
Great day for the long way
You know I can drive
So very, so very slow
On the way, we sat there quietly
Oh, my eyes were closed
Your hands turned on the high beams

Don't take me [don't take me]
Don't take me [dont take me]
No
Don't take me [don't take me]
Don't take me [don't take me]
Please don't take me
[Oh]
I would give anything just to be there
I'm the one waiting
I'm the one waiting
I'm the one waiting"
9386,"[Verse 1: Kool Shen]
At the dawn of the year 2000
It's not the same for the youth anymore
For those in the streets, for those trying to get them off
Anyway, there’s no more jobs
The circle is now complete, the system is flooded
And the youth are drunk, dirtied under the silence
The only way out is the street, even if it's covered in blood
It's not a problem for those who are prepared
Some will even make it out better off than they were before
But for the rest, it’s not gonna be easy
No need to hide your face, it's not enough to sell kilos
You gotta protect your turf for tomorrow
To make sure your people are getting by
Dodge the shivs to keep your goods intact
Your core crew, tightly knit
Listen to the scanner to decide whether to keep the contact or
Move, avoid the red zones and of course, never go on vacation
Is that what you want for your son?
Is that how you want him to grow up?
I don't have any advice to give
But you don't want him slippin'
Watch over him, when he speaks, listen to him!
Don't let him look elsewhere
For the love that should be in your eyes
[Chorus: Kool Shen]
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin’
Or coming back with vices
Don’t let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin’

[Verse 2: Joey Starr]
Fuck! When he told me, ""I never asked to have you!""
It was these drunken words that convinced me
My father contributed to pushing me to the streets
I thought I found something better, I saw
I was just a 14-year-old boy with a discrepancy in age
I could catch a glimpse like it was a mirage
No more restrictions, just a ruthless ambition
To bite the forbidden lifestyle
To make the most of everything that happens next
The streets were able take me 'cause it trusted me
Something that was a like a nuisance for my father
Neither of us wanted to patch things up
Every attempt showed us we had too much pride
My father wasn't a singer, but he loved singing the same old song
Especially the ones that hit you like a stab in the chest
He thought he was playing it cool, he didn't want to or even try to
Put aside his fucking ego that was straining family ties
A little more every day
He must’ve seen me as more worthless than a hooptie in L'argus
So I had to give up and find my own accomplices
My partners in slippin', sorry if I'm getting too personal
[Chorus: Kool Shen]
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'
Or coming back with vices
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'

[Verse 3: Kool Shen]
What did you want your son to learn in the streets?
What virtues did you think they'd teach him?
You haven't seen how much it reeks out there
But what's the stench of death like?
When you breathe it in, man, you're like a stillborn
You limit yourself by going 'round in circles
Your brain fails you, then jumps to conclusions
It's really bad when you lose control
When in the eyes of others, you play into your role more and more
Your role of caille-ra, just so no one says
""You're no longer part of the crew""
It's crazy, but it's like that
Down here more than anywhere, survival is a fight
With low blows, baton swings
Dodges and ""Pow!""s in fucking brawls
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'
Or coming back with vices
No, don't let your son hang out in the street
[Chorus: Kool Shen]
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'
Or coming back with vices
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'
Don't let your son hang out in the street
If you don't want him slippin'
Or coming back with vices
Don't let your son hang out on the street"

Cults twist the truth into clever lies

God incarnate to taste a bitter death

Chorus:
Black Light, Blind Sight, Black Light, Hindsight, Black Light
His Word is clear, 1 Corinthians 15, if Christ did not rise your faith is in vain
He rose from the grave to give us new life but they reject Him and bask in black light

Deliver everything from me so that in the end It's getting dusty
I feel empty with nothing to deliver
My feet are not buried

[Breakdown]
My head is in a cloud
My feet are not buried

The account will stop some day?
Waste time (Waste time)
The weight of emotions fades
In spite of everything

My feet are not buried
My head is in a cloud
My feet are not buried

4766,"Love is the reason you were born
Love was the gleam in papa's eye

People suddenly meet
People suddenly fit
People suddenly hit
And brother, that's it

Personally
Love is a kick right in the pants
Love is the aspirin you buy

If you're flappin' your fins
If you're climbin' a wall
There must be a reason for it all
What is the reason for it all?
Love is the reason for it all

Love is the night you can't recall
Love is the extra drink you drank
Love's a shot in the arm
Love's a poke in the ribs
Buyin' bottles and bibs
And fillin' up cribs

Obviously
Love is an old established trap
Ten million suckers walk the plank

If you land on your tail
Every time that you fall
I can't see the reason for it
Who needs a reason for it?
Love is the reason for it all

All night the teasin' in the hall
Hallways are lovely for a call
Call it the season
I say, ""Love is the reason for it all"""

And you know how they lived
Yeah, you know what they is
Sometimes you got to dig in, in

Footprints trace fossils are found
Petrified – stone hard

Providing evidence of life going way back
And clues found of our home – environments had
Sediments are covering land, they can form in the past
Petrified, carbon films, mold, and cast
The fossil record shows us the animals going  back
Another is the changes organisms have had
It’s fossils, that’s the facts

You and me were probably meant to be
So this is fucking with me mentally
Cos´ I love you more than anything
That´s why I keep you far away from me

I´m not your type I can tell, you better go get someone else
Look at the way I treat myself, I don´t give a fuck about my health
And you´re looking for a real man, someone who can tell you ""it´s allright""
I can´t tell you nothing like it, you´re too good for my own sight
But don´t you dare get it wrong, I would have been there right away
But the fact is I ain´t got shit, and I´m probably gonna´get locked away
So why do you wanna´get caught in this shit
Before we started we are history
Cause I need you to understand I love you, that´s why you should leave me

[Verse 2]
I´m not what you want me to be, though I wish I was in a way
But the problem bothering me, is that I can´t provide you with things
That you need to be treated proper, I don´t wanna´ see you left with nothing
Cause you deserve the whole world and I wish I could have given you the sun on top of that girl
Everybody´s looking at me expecting things, that I don´t finish and I don´t want a queen
To be left with a jester who´s destined to mess up everything I get within my reach please
I don´t wanna´ keep no secrets, I don´t wanna´ break your heart in pieces

Changing my ways
I'd not touch' a drop again

And many jugs I've emptied
I felt so rejected
I didn't wanna go astray
Half my life's been wasted
By the booze I've tasted
But the demon I have faced it
And sent him on his way

I hope I'll be forgiven
For all my bad livin'
I had to make some changes
Or he’d have got me in the end
Now I have a pretty woman
She gives me good lovin', yeah

I observe the Valley with an immense cloud of darkness

A shadow under the dead trees
With a sword in hand he approaches

My bleeding feet and my petrified hands
Obey the whisper of his voice

A dark spell is cast at me
I can finally hear the wailing of the trees
The sound of the night

Down a little hole in my dungeon
A shadow under the dead trees"

And though I tried to understand
My folks, they said I need a plan
That I'd withdraw on my return
With all the ways that I could earn
And so I ride into the town
Where I would lay my quarters down
And sugar up for my return
And get back home with time to burn

[Verse 2]
And though I thought I knew it all
I wondered where I'd sit next fall
As I recall when I was young
The ways I tried to jump the gun
I bought some time not long ago

Them kids have left but here I stay
As if it's just another day

They're calling me home
Been stuck in this city, for too long

Living this way is slowly
Driving me insane
Oh I can not breathe
Between four walls

And like the rivers that are running
I am meant to be that wide
Sorry, I'm not sorry
I'll forever be a child

The earth is my mother
I am carried by the wind
Guided by the stars
And the fire within

The beauty of silence
In a world full of noise
Luxury today is offline mode
While you're looking at your screen
I'm out here leaving the dream
And you're welcome
Anytime you'd like to join

And like the rivers that are running
I am meant to be that wide
Sorry, I'm not sorry

Oh the earth is my mother
And I'm carried by the wind
Guided by the stars
And the fire within

I share religion with that tree
Worshiping creation
With every breath i breathe

May I always remember
And forever see
The light that is you
The light that is me

And we'll make love, and let the telephone ring

Ring, ring, doorbell, ring
Baby, come on in, I got Mel Blanc on the radio
I'm glad you came around
Been feeling down, talking to Tony and Mario

You know they make good conversation
Still it ain't no conciliation
'Cause I got love and baby, I'll give you some
And if somebody comes, we'll let the doorbell ring

I said ring, ring, golden ring around the sun
Around your pretty finger
Ring, ring, voices ring with a happy tune
Anybody can be a singer
The sun comes up across the city
I swear you never looked so young and pretty

With the preacher man, let the wedding bell ring

Hand in hand, we'll stand upon the sand

Stink of booze, I'm knackered, it's a good life
Step over schnapps corpses that pollute my way
I see the rats eating themselves fat in the shadow of the kebab shop
Stamp through the vomit at Kotti, junkies are pissed
Mates snort around me, make themselves comfortable
Scene-hipsters on a troubled search for the scene
Pierced girls who want me to read ""Straßenfеger""
Half five, my eyеs burn
Step on a guy sleeping between two dead pigeons
Hysterical girls bicker and panic and then
On the corner there's stress between Tarek and Sam
Tarek says ""Shut your mouth or I'll punch you in the face""
Sam shits himself, but he can't say nothing
Red soup drips on the asphalt

Good morning Berlin
You can be so ugly, so dirty and grey
You can be so beautifully terrible
Your nights eat me up
It would probably be best for me
I go home and get some sleep
And as I walk through the street
It slowly turns from black to blue
[Bridge]
Tired forms in neon lights
With deep creases in their faces
The early shift stays silent, everyone keeps to themselves
Frustration comes, because the bus doesn't come

And there's shit everywhere, really you have to float
Everyone has a dog, but no-one to talk to
I constantly breathe through my mouth, it's part of my life
I feel unhealthy, need something pure to treat it
I have a thick head, I need juice
I have a powerful yearning for ""Baghdad's Bakery""
It's warm there, I devote myself to my dreams
With Fatima, the sweet baker
R'n'B ballads pump from a parked Benz
Work's over for the street gangs
A hooligan lies in a woman's arms and weeps
The city isn't as hard as you think

Good morning Berlin

Out of my eyes

That I need you in order to breathe"

A little drunk and worn out from the show
It's a hallway to a hotel room

I see her there just lying on the bed
She's seen me through my yesterdays
God knows tonight I'm needing her again

She's the one I hold when there's no one to hold on to
She's been with me late at night
When I was drowning in the dark

So I thank my lucky stars
For every crack and scratch and scar on this guitar

When I can't find the pieces
Fingers scratching in the dirt
And she offers no forgiveness 'cause she likes to make it hurt

I'm writing down my story and I hope this ain't the climax

I only follow my map
Don't give me no directions kid I'm tryna live it high class
You ain't welcome in this section
2017 is my class but I don't feel no connection because all I see are life hacks tryna run from this oppression
All I do is wake up
Get to work and chase a dream
I won't let a damn degree or anybody get between
Y'all are glued and stuck to screens
I'm pursuing make believe and I'm not sure which one is crazier
Sometimes I think it's me but I still give all I got
I'm tryna break out of these chains
I'm tryna give these dreams a shot
I just hope I got the aim
Because honestly if not I'm scared to feel all of that pain of getting tied up in a knot and having nobody to save me from myself
This right here is my life force
Anything and everything that I stay alive for
You wanna try and take it from me
Fuck it, I'll die for it
I'm building up my legacy ain't something there's time for

Have you ever wanted something so bad that you can't sleep
That you can't breathe
That you can't eat
That you can't speak
That you can't leave or back up in the past

You can have it if you dream it
Manifest and learn to beat it

It's crazy how life goes
Everybody's ticking all around for those high notes
But when you just a foot above the ground on a tight rope
Drowning, needing help
They ain't providing no life boats
I'm back in that white coat
Cooking something crazy in the lab
I'm finding comfort in insanity
It's something that you have
If you been chasing after dreams then honestly I'm kinda glad because the worst thing that they taught me was insanity is bad
All this humanity I have is not destroyed but it's eroded
I never knew to get stronger that you've gotta be broken
I never knew that doors close just so others could open
I guess that's why they remind you that thorns come with the roses
Now every motherfucking moment I got eyes on my back
Once you got a foundations when they pray you collapse
Kid I still haven't made it don't tell me to relax
Cause I got people that hate this that probably setting their traps
It's nothing but facts
It's all I think about inside my head
It's all that keeps me going when I'm hanging by a thread
I'll never have a backup plan or shit to do instead
Cause if I'm not living these dreams then I'm already fucking dead

And I've been talking to God asking for just a little help with you but it's hopeless
It's not the first time but this one really carved it in
And tell your new friends that they don't know you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again
Oh, Oh it's not the first time, but this one really carved it in
Tell your new friends that no one knows you like I do
It's over
I wanna see you again
I wanna feel it again

'Till heaven calls, keep holding on"
5600,"Today I Started Loving You Again
I'm right back where I've really always been;
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then Today I Started Loving You Again

What a fool I was to think I could get by
With only these few million tears I've cried
I should have known the worst was yet to come
And that crying time for me had just begun

'Cause Today I Started Loving You Again
I'm right back where I've really always been;
I got over you just long enough to let my heartache mend
Then Today I Started Loving You Again"
5119,"[Verse 1]
For your heart they will mug you
For your soul they will trick you
Just things hard to come by

Know this, the world's an evil machine
What you need is a ghost
But there's no friendly ghost

Roland, I feel you
It is mayhem out these days
I specialize in end times, too
Last night I dreamt I was flying the jet
Into the mothership
But then i woke up too soon

[Chorus]
Hold tight, get a grip
The whole world is going to hell
The kids riot out in the streets
And Daddy ain't paying my rent no more
[Verse 2]
We hoped for salvation
And invented a device
But created a monster
And got killed by its hands
And in the air a sweet melody
It is a lullaby
An apocalypso beat

[Chorus]
Hold tight, get a grip
The whole world is going to hell
The kids riot out in the streets
And baby ain't feeling the love no more

[Chorus]
Hold tight, get a grip
The whole world is going to hell
Kids into this world
Yes, until no prick is in charge no more"

853,"Why did it happen to me instead of them?
Why did I let it control me?
If pain is in the eye of the beholder
Why did I let it ruin me?
I had the option to embrace faults
But it's hard when people don't see you for who you are
They only see you for the color of your skin
I've been discriminated, I've been inundated
After a while, I chose to be isolated
It was easier that way
To avoid their stares
I took the road over like a shy legionnare
But that wasn't the only thing causing my refrain
Mixtures of anxiety and pusillanimity rattled my brain
My heart goes out to anyone who's ever felt the pain
I've learned perspective and empathy
Two things that could change the world
If only they mattered, in a world so disturbed

I often look back on those years with fright at midnight
With a heart that tightens up by the reflection of a phone light
I had fears that it'd never go away
And I'd always be alone
No advice could convince me to accept it and let go
Hate is taught, and beauty is an opinion
So how can something natural be considered disgusting?
For years I felt ashamed
Because others couldn't deal with my skin
I'm sure Mr. Success doesn't remember laughing in my face
Calling me petty names, and excluding me from things
They threw trash, stole milk, stepped in my space
And ignorantly recommended washing my face
Convenience store prescriptions did nothing for me
But they couldn't understand no matter how hard I preached
Those years were supposed to be a learning period
But all I learned was how to be castrated
I cried when my own father screamed at me
For having something that I couldn't control
So blame genetics, blame society's views
You're all just a bunch of worthless beauty tools
It's not about technique
It's not about routine
When you're ridiculed for existing
I'm not asking for pity
They have the right to hate
We promote a flawless world
With no room for mistakes
And I think there's something about it
That you'll never understand
While you're kissing your boyfriend
And holding his hand
If it comes back
It'd be nothing new
Sometimes there's nothing you can do
Those years are gone, and I can never get them back
I'm a survivor, though I've been cracked
I choose to learn from the past
Butt of a wit. Scars to prove it"

While making your mind move fast

You wanna know how high high high
Betty, This is for Mommy?
Oh dear lord I think she’s

She was such a nice woman
She was funny but not in ah haha funny way
Yes, Perhaps she could refuse sacral therapy
But she danced very well

You’re a bad man who kidnaps, and blackmails,and tortures
And wears a camera Susan’s camera
And those are Susans sunglasses
Susan!
Hi,Amy
You killed my mom
Casualty of war
They say if you killed in your dream ,you die in real life
Now, I will kill you
After that, I'm taking this stinking boat back to Washington
Where I kill your peanut farming father
Which means my dad and I can move back into the White House
Where we fucking belong
Don’t swear this is my dream
If you kill me, the dream will end
We’ll see about that
I'm taking over your dream
Wait
You can have the White House

Come and stay with me

You [?] there
And I'm coming your path.

Chirping Chen
And he’ll play with Misty Malarky ying yang

Prepare to die
I have a tree house
One
I have a fabulous pool tide
Coz you’re Susan Ford
Nothing’s cooler than that
Two
Ya. You’re cool real cool and real dump
What?
You can’t kill me with your barbie
You really are stupid if you believed that
Aw!
Always thought you were the coolest person ever
Instead you’re just a terrorist
It hurts
You’re a mean girl
Coz you’re jealous
You’re the meanest girl  of any girl alive or dead
Who’s ever lived in the White House
And worst of all, you took all the girls to believe
And they can do things that they can’t do
Because they’re real girls
Like free me American Hostages right there
And for that Susan Ford you will die
Dead
Everyone’s dead
Mom, Susan, Mrs. Ford
Not good at all
It’s all my fault
My stupid dream
And everyone’s dead
Mom, I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
Don’t be dead
Don’t be dead

Amy I'm just  thirsty
Mom,are you ok?
If you want me to be ok, then I'll be ok
I want you to be ok
Susan, oh.She’s dead
If you want her to be dead
Oh? Oh… well
She did
She would be
She didn’t want to free the hostages
She just wanted to kill you Mrs. ford
But after she did she just went bunkers
She needed to see a therapist
She may not have met to kill any other

Sometimes people do things they don’t mean to
And sometimes little girls have dreams to beg
You just need to be a little older to make them come true

So now I'll have to move back home to Georgia
Probably
And spend our whole life farming peanuts
Probably
And just be normal
Yes,we’ll just be normal
You’ll never be normal
You are the child of the President
Susan. I'm sorry I shot you mother
Dear.Every daughter wants to kill her mother at sometime or another
Most don’t ,still I understand the instant and forgive you
Just don’t embarrass me anymore in public and we’ll be ok
Deal
Time for me to wake up and be back home

Wait. before we have to go back to our normal lives
Let’s go some place fun
Puertorico!

Isn’t it neat that for forever’s we make a fabulous team

We’re gonna do our best to make our [?] life
As long as we stick through and honest to ourselves
Anything we do will turn out right
Right?

Who would have thought that you love us
And we would call us friends

Put on my blue suede shoes
And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me?
Yeah I've got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

I saw the ghost of Elvis
Down on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
There's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room
[Chorus]
Then I was walking in Memphis
Was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Was walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?

[Bridge]
Yeah, 'cause they've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And the Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy, you've got a prayer in Memphis
Yeah in Memphis

[Verse 3]
Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all of my might
She said ""Tell me are you a Christian, son?""
And I said ""Ma'am I am tonight""

[Chorus]
I was walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale (Walk, walk, walk)
Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)
But do I really feel the way I feel?

Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale (Walk, walk, walk)
Walking in Memphis (Walking in Memphis)

1448,"A metronome beat keeps us in sync
For every new bar a different color blink
Sixteen led's flashing plus one next to gain
You copy and paste yourself into my brain

Patterns to be followed arrangements to be made
Tracks to be programmed new patterns to be laid
Loops that fit the beat in the same strain
You always find a way into my brain

From my brain to your chips
From your filters to my heart
We'll build a perfect groove you're playing them at the start
From the outlets to my ears through pleasure and pain
You always find a way into my brain
Oh no (Into my brain)"

Sick of all your s*** tonight
And I ain’t playing around
No I ain’t f***ing around
I’m in the studio way past midnight
And way past your bedtime
You wanna cheat that’s fine I’ll leave your ass behind
‘Bout to diss you on the track and I ain’t holding back
Your p****’s whack and I only speak facts
I was just wondering how long relationships last
F*** it it’s in the past all my side b****** ready to smash
Can’t believe I was so naïve for so long
Cleaning and holding down the house the whole weekend you were gone
So it’s like a roommate situation
Separate rooms
‘Cept no one cleans or even cooks the food
I can’t wait ‘til I can come outta this mess on top
Out here headlining shows while you out there sucking c***
No more tears b**** I hope you get what you deserve
Always remember love is just a four letter word
[Hook]
All the hate you send to me will never be the end of me
I don’t really like your energy you make the perfect enemy
You’ll always be my enemy
Enemy I don’t like your energy
I’ma stand my ground til the death of me
Enemy enemy I don’t like your energy
I’ma stand my ground til the death of me
Enemy enemy I don’t like your energy
I’ma stand my ground til the death of me
Enemy enemy I don’t like your energy
I’ma stand my ground til the death of me

[Verse 2]
5 years of this s*** and I finally had enough
Giving you attention you deserve was never good enough
All the nights in the studio and I was stressing
Hoping one day god would give me a blessing
And then I got the Rolling Stone and you said so what
So what I put my whole life on the line for this
F*** you mean my music’s what I eat and sleep s*** and piss
Guess the bad outweighs the good now don’t it
Can’t rewind the time back now and you know it
And that’s your favorite rapper’s flow and I just stole it
But back now to the hardships that you put me through
It’s like you been training me the whole time to be a better you
Thank god we never got married and had kids
You were just the highest bidder and you got outbid
This the coolest switch of flows I think I ever did
You are trying to be a wrestler and you should probably quit
[Hook]
All the hate you send to me will never be the end of me
I don’t really like your energy you make the perfect enemy
You’ll always be my enemy
Enemy I don’t like your energy

I know you're in the mood for it
Just blame it on the mood
There's nothing left to do for us
There's nothing left to lose
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't got nothing left to lose
I know what it's like, Elsa had a few
When I'm after you and I had a few
I get turned on by your attitude
Shoot my shot in the dark
Been after you right from the start
Compatible with my hard-drive
I'll never give you a hard time
Been in a slump for days
You walked in acting unfazed
You lift me up like Donnie Blaze
You pick me up when I cave
So let's get down to serious business
I'd rather ask forgiveness
Then have to ask permission
For try'na steal your kisses
Now, I'm try'na get some time alone with you
Try'na read the lines between the groove
Try'na keep it cool around the crew
Try'na find a room for us to use
We ain't got much time left for us
When we collide, I combust
I be like ""Who her? She aight""
Sneak back to the back of the bus and rush

Just want you in my bedding
First time I met you I knew one day I'd be making records
I know I ain't Strange enough
And yet you still showing up
We keep it cool around our friends but they still get the message
Half of the time we just hide
Habit of mine, I don't mind
Laughing at lies we devised
Meet for the night in disguise
I don't know where this is headed
But I'm gon' fight to get it
Tequila, ice, and lemons has always been our favorite beverage
We know what this is and what's good
Don't know if we will or we should
We gon' let it do what it do
Ain't gonna push you harder, it's cool
I know you'll be back in there soon

Just blame it on the mood
There's nothing left to do for us
There's nothing left to lose

Just blame it on the mood
Blame it on the mood

I was sitting at a bar just mending my heart and waiting on my luck to change
When there walked a man from the plain
Ireland on what he called a holiday
Well, he sat next to me saying ""Boy, I believe that you could use another drink""
Then he raised up his glass at four in the past
And was toast to all that's gonna be

[Chorus]
Here's to a long life
And a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
A pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to cold beer
And another one

[Verse 2]
By the time I put down that first round, he ordered number two or three
And before I could say ""Hey what's your name?""
He stood up and said to me
[Chorus]
Here's to a long life
And a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
A pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to cold beer
And another one

[Verse 3]
By the end of the night he said so many times
""I could walk the straight line if I try""
But before he left, he wished me the best
And here’s how he said goodbye

[Chorus]
Here's to a long life
And a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
A pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to cold beer
And another one

[Chorus]
Here's to a long life
And a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
A pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to cold beer
And another one
[Bridge]
Here's to a cold beer
And another one

[Chorus]
Here's to a long life
And a merry one
Here's to a quick death and an easy one
A pretty girl and an honest one
Here's to cold beer
And another one"
9208,"Falling asleep over earth
Leaving the ground for the lovers
Cast away back for the better days
When I knew it was easy to lie
When I'd only one hand for goodbyes, then

I slipped under the empty bed
Got lost inside the dark hollows
It's the black of your lenses I still can't see through
And if you had been looking at me
Then you'd know I'd intended to leave, here

I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time

I've gotta know we're better here than we were last year

I can never just say what I mean
Can only manage to say something similar
If my tongue wasn't moored to the bow of my lips
Then I'd surely be able to say
That our black and white has become grey
I don't get to make you nervous. But I got to, tonight
I don't mean to make you nervous, I'm gonna have to, this time"

Whoa!

[Verse 1]
Mean and infectious, the evil prophets rise
Dance of the Macabre, as witches streak the sky
Decadent worship of black magic sorcery
In the womb of the Devil's Dungeon trapped without a plea, oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Seething in agony, necrosis is the fate
Pins stickin' through the skin, the venom now sedates
Locked in a pillory, nowhere to be found
Screaming for your life, no one hears a sound
Help me!

[Verse 3]
Prepare the patient's scalp to peel away
Metal caps his ears, he'll hear not what we say
Solid steel visor riveted across his eyes
Iron staples close his jaws so no one hears his cries
[Chorus]
The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath

[Verse 4]
Now you're drawn and quartered, your bones will make the 'X'
Symbol stands for poison and it's chained to your head
And as we fold your arms to make the holy cross
We cross the crucifix; religion has been lost

The skull beneath the skin
The skull beneath the skin

When to the session sweet silent thought
Chaos, wars, dysfunction, Men's eyes
Trouble, deaf heaven with heartless cries
We're not alone but we've been an outcast state
Looking upon ourselves and cursing all fate
Wishes to be more, rich and hope
Able to save this man's art and that man's scope
Featured like them, like them with friends possessed
With what I most enjoy can find no rest
Like a nightingale on break-a-day arising
And these ripening thoughts: foolishness, wisening
Happily I think of you and then my fate
From sullen earth rings hymns at heavens gate
Your sweet friendship remembered such wealth brings
Then I scorn to change my state with kings

When I think of you my friend
Sorrows are restored and losses end
I think of you and then my state
From sullen earth rings hymns at heavens gate
Your sweet friendship remembered such wealth brings
Then I scorn to change my state with kings
When I think of you my friend
When I think of you my friend
Sorrows are restored and losses end
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
We sigh the lack of many a-things we saw
We summon up remembrance of things past
Deeply drown an eye accustomed to flow
Deeper fresh life's  lock since cancelled woe
A precious soul's haft a deathless night
And cried the loss of many a vanished sight

They grieve that lifetime's forgone
Promised from day to day promised over
Many are underdogs few born a four leaf clover

When I think of you, my friend
All sorrows are restored and losses end
When I think of you my friend
All sorrows are restored and losses end


When I think of you my friend
All sorrows are restored and losses end
I think of you and then my state
From sullen earth rings hymns at heavens gate
Your sweet friendship remembered such wealth brings
Then I scorn to change my state with kings
When I think of you my friend
When I think of you my friend
Sorrows are restored and losses end
Over base, clouds rising
Early morning shines
More an hour yours and mine
Existing in glory with no disgrace

True beauty, your celestial face
Kissing with gold and hearts, the meadows gleam
How many glorious mornings have they seen?
With all triumphant splendor from their brow
The regions clouds of masked from us now

Still hope always will remain suns of the world human loss and gain
Always will remain suns of the world human loss and gain"

2728,"        The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

        From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

        In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.

        As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.

        ""It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,"" said Lord Henry languidly. ""You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place.""

        ""I don't think I shall send it anywhere,"" he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. ""No, I won't send it anywhere.""

        Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. ""Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.""

        ""I know you will laugh at me,"" he replied, ""but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.""

        Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.

        ""Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.""

        ""Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.""
        ""You don't understand me, Harry,"" answered the artist. ""Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.""

        ""Dorian Gray? Is that his name?"" asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward.

        ""Yes, that is his name. I didn't intend to tell it to you.""

        ""But why not?""

        ""Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?""

        ""Not at all,"" answered Lord Henry, ""not at all, my dear Basil. You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces. My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact, than I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she merely laughs at me.""

        ""I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. ""I believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose.""

        ""Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.

        After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. ""I am afraid I must be going, Basil,"" he murmured, ""and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago.""

        ""What is that?"" said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.

        ""You know quite well.""

        ""I do not, Harry.""

        ""Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture. I want the real reason.""
        ""I told you the real reason.""

        ""No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it. Now, that is childish.""

        ""Harry,"" said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, ""every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.""

        Lord Henry laughed. ""And what is that?"" he asked.

        ""I will tell you,"" said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his face.

        ""I am all expectation, Basil,"" continued his companion, glancing at him.

        ""Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,"" answered the painter; ""and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly believe it.""

        Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it. ""I am quite sure I shall understand it,"" he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, ""and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.""

        The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and wondered what was coming.

        ""The story is simply this,"" said the painter after some time. ""Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.""

        ""Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.""

        ""I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either. However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud--I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. 'You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?""

        ""Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,"" said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.
        ""I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her once before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him. Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined to know each other.""

        ""And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?"" asked his companion. ""I know she goes in for giving a rapid precis of all her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know.""

        ""Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!"" said Hallward listlessly.

        ""My dear fellow, she tried to found a salon, and only succeeded in opening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?""

        ""Oh, something like, 'Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable. Quite forget what he does--afraid he--doesn't do anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.""

        ""Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,"" said the young lord, plucking another daisy.

        Hallward shook his head. ""You don't understand what friendship is, Harry,"" he murmured--""or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.""

        ""How horribly unjust of you!"" cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky. ""Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.""

        ""I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.""

        ""My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.""

        ""And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?""

        ""Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.""

        ""Harry!"" exclaimed Hallward, frowning.

        ""My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help detesting my relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly.""

        ""I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either.""

        Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. ""How English you are Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to do--he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray. How often do you see him?""

        ""Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day. He is absolutely necessary to me.""

        ""How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your art.""

        ""He is all my art to me now,"" said the painter gravely. ""I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things differently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. 'A dream of form in days of thought'--who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad--for he seems to me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty--his merely visible presence--ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body--how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.""

        ""Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.""

        Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After some time he came back. ""Harry,"" he said, ""Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him. He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there. He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That is all.""

        ""Then why won't you exhibit his portrait?"" asked Lord Henry.

        ""Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know anything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry--too much of myself!""

        ""Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.""

        ""I hate them for it,"" cried Hallward. ""An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.""

        ""I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you?""

        The painter considered for a few moments. ""He likes me,"" he answered after a pause; ""I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.""

        ""Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,"" murmured Lord Henry. ""Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly well-informed man--that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his tone of colour, or something. You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.""

        ""Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel. You change too often.""

        ""Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies."" And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends--those were the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt's, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to Hallward and said, ""My dear fellow, I have just remembered.""

        ""Remembered what, Harry?""

        ""Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.""

        ""Where was it?"" asked Hallward, with a slight frown.

        ""Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's. She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.""

        ""I am very glad you didn't, Harry.""

        ""Why?""

        ""I don't want you to meet him.""

        ""You don't want me to meet him?""

        ""No.""

        ""Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,"" said the butler, coming into the garden.

        ""You must introduce me now,"" cried Lord Henry, laughing.

        The painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight. ""Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments."" The man bowed and went up the walk.

        Then he looked at Lord Henry. ""Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,"" he said. ""He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him. Don't spoil him. Don't try to influence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you."" He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.

        ""What nonsense you talk!"" said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house."

7724,"When day comes, we ask ourselves
Where can we find light in this never-ending shade?
The loss we carry, a sea we must wade
We've braved the belly of the beast
We've learned that quiet isn't always peace
And the norms and notions of what ""just is"" isn't always justice
And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it
Somehow, we do it
Somehow, wе've weatherеd and witnessed a nation that isn't broken
But simply unfinished
We, the successors of a country and a time
Where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother
Can dream of becoming president
Only to find herself reciting for one
And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine
But that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect
We are striving to forge a union with purpose
To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man
And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us
But what stands before us
We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside
We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another
We seek harm to none and harmony for all
Let the globe, if nothing else, say, ""This is true""
That even as we grieved, we grew
That even as we hurt, we hoped
That even as we tired, we tried
That we'll forever be tied together victorious
Not because we will never again know defeat
But because we will never again sow division
Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid
If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lighten the blade
But in all the bridges we've made, that is the promise to glade
The hill we climb, if only we dare it
Because being American is more than a pride we inherit
It's the past we step into and how we repair it
We've seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it
Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy
And this effort very nearly succeeded
But while democracy can be periodically delayed
It can never be permanently defeated
In this truth, in this faith, we trust
For while we have our eyes on the future
History has its eyes on us
This is the era of just redemption
We feared it at its inception
We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour
But within it, we found the power to author a new chapter
To offer hope and laughter
To ourselves
So, while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?
Now, we assert
How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?
We will not march back to what was
But move to what shall be
A country that is bruised, but whole
Benevolent, but bold
Fierce and free
We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation
Because we know our inaction and inertia
Will be the inheritance of the next generation
Our blunders become their burdens
But one thing is certain
If we merge mercy with might and might with right
Then love becomes our legacy
And change, our children's birthright
So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left with
Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest
We will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one
We will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the West
We will rise from the wind-swept Northeast
Where our forefathers first realized revolution
We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states
We will rise from the sun-baked South
We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover
In every known nook of our nation
In every corner called our country
Our people diverse and beautiful
Will emerge battered and beautiful
When day comes, we step out of the shade
Aflame and unafraid
The new dawn blooms as we free it
For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it
If only we're brave enough to be it"

8739,"I’ve been playing with fire
Borrowed hearts that weren’t for hire
Looking for someone to make it all better
Didn’t see that I already had her

Living on hope
I followed signs for reckless love
Looking for trouble without even knowing
What I needed was everything you showed me

Why don’t you tell me how to make this right
I’ll be waiting on our bridge tonight
Can’t stand another moment wasting time
We’re wasting time
We could be  lost and found

I’ve been covered in ice
While flying too close to the sun
Staying close, losing touch, chasing my shadow
Should’ve known only you could make it better
Living like a ghost
Watching us go up in smoke
Staying up, sleeping in, broken and shattered
If I said I’m sorry would it matter?"

[Chorus]
One for DJs, two for MCs, three stands for grafitti artistry
Four for B-Boys in the B-Boy stands
Five for inner man leaving nothing to chance
Six for family, 'cause we down for life
Seven for completion that we found in Christ
Count 'em off, represent the seven factors to come
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[Verse 1]
Ay, ay, ay, man come here, come here for a second
Come here, I gotta ask you a question (What's that?)
Explain the name change, why you switch from Mr. Max?
Because ""max"" means to rеlax and I'm done with sitting back
It's time to act, respond, rеact, as a matter of fact it's wack
When you're lazy, you're acting slack, but you gotta be on attack
But my name is what you asked, so I better be getting back
To explaining this simple fact before I run out of track
Form, like formulate, form, like that of Christ
Form, like Voltron giving you nightmares at night
Form, like good health, form, like how you see me
Form, like taking shape as in The Wonder Twins on TV
Form your own opinion acting like someone who knows
Form your own crew, have meetings, diss my flows
Form a long line, that's a lot of people hatin'
Why you forming rude or bitterness? I'm steady formulating
[Chorus]
One for DJs, two for MCs, three stands for grafitti artistry

Count 'em off, represent the seven factors to come
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[Verse 2]
Absorbing, observing, unnerving the crowd
Expecting, rejecting, reflecting aloud
The revolution is grammatical, sabbatical in transition
Peace amidst the battle meant to rattle disposition
While some continue hating, I commence the elevation
Strive for constant innovation that’s shaking the whole foundation
Whenever the beat drops, catchin’ ears like B. Spears
Millions throughout the years I’m hearing they [?] for fears
Tears falling like rain, music helps to maintain
Lyrics that ease the pain to strengthen that which remains
Vocabulary is wary of touching on the Divine
You think you’re singing something when, hi, you’re sipping wine
I got time so all the fines saying, ”slow, you can’t rewind”
I know you’re lost, but you can find a wisdom greater than your mind
Able to cross the lines, helping us to define
What’s creeping into your minds and causing us to confine
Ourselves, our duties, our places, our roles
Our cultures, our people, our spirit, our souls
[Chorus]
One for DJs, two for MCs, three stands for graffiti artistry

1361,"[1] Listen therefore, O kings, and understand;
learn, O judges of the ends of the earth.

[2] Give ear, you that rule over multitudes,
and boast of many nations.

[3] For your dominion was given you from the Lord,
and your sovereignty from the Most High,
who will search out your works and inquire into your plans.

[4] Because as servants of his kingdom you did not rule rightly,
nor keep the law,
nor walk according to the purpose of God,

[5] he will come upon you terribly and swiftly,
because severe judgment falls on those in high places.

[6] For the lowliest man may be pardoned in mercy,
but mighty men will be mightily tested.

[7] For the Lord of all will not stand in awe of any one,
nor show deference to greatness;
because he himself made both small and great,
and he takes thought for all alike.
[8] But a strict inquiry is in store for the mighty.

[9] To you then, O monarchs, my words are directed,
that you may learn wisdom and not transgress.

[10] For they will be made holy who observe holy things in holiness,
and those who have been taught them will find a defense.

[11] Therefore set your desire on my words;
long for them, and you will be instructed.

[12] Wisdom is radiant and unfading,
and she is easily discerned by those who love her,
and is found by those who seek her.

[13] She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her.

[14] He who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty,
for he will find her sitting at his gates.

[15] To fix one's thought on her is perfect understanding,
and he who is vigilant on her account will
soon be free from care,

[16] because she goes about seeking those worthy of her,
and she graciously appears to them in their paths,
and meets them in every thought.
[17] The beginning of wisdom is the most sincere
desire for instruction,
and concern for instruction is love of her,

[18] and love of her is the keeping of her laws,
and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality,

[19] and immortality brings one near to God;

[20] so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom.

[21] Therefore if you delight in thrones and scepters,
O monarchs over the peoples,
honor wisdom, that you may reign for ever.

[22] I will tell you what wisdom is and how she came to be,
and I will hide no secrets from you,
but I will trace her course from the beginning of creation,
and make knowledge of her clear,
and I will not pass by the truth;

[23] neither will I travel in the company of sickly envy,
for envy does not associate with wisdom.

[24] A multitude of wise men is the salvation of the world,
and a sensible king is the stability of his people.
[25] Therefore be instructed by my words, and you will profit."

Slipping under, sliding down
All I need is a certain trigger
The path you take will never make you happy
All I need is a certain spur

694,"WITH the morning my friend's nerves were re-braced, and he was not less excited by curiosity than myself. Perhaps more; for he evidently believed in his own story, and I felt considerable doubt of it: not that he would have wilfully told an untruth, but that I thought he must have been under one of those hallucinations which seize on our fancy or our nerves in solitary, unaccustomed places, and in which we give shape to the formless and sound to the dumb.

We selected six veteran miners to watch our descent; and as the cage held only one at a time, the engineer descended first; and when he had gained the ledge at which he had before halted, the cage re-arose for me. I soon gained his side. We had provided ourselves with a strong coil of rope.

The light struck on my sight as it had done the day before on my friend's. The hollow through which it came sloped diagonally: it seemed to me a diffused atmospheric light, not like that from fire, but soft and silvery, as from a northern star. Quitting the cage, we descended, one after the other, easily enough, owing to the juts in the side, till we reached the place at which my friend had previously halted, and which was a projection just spacious enough to allow us to stand abreast. From this spot the chasm widened rapidly like the lower end of a vast funnel, and I saw distinctly the valley, the road, the lamps which my companion had described. He had exaggerated nothing. I heard the sounds he had heard--a mingled indescribable hum as of voices and a dull tramp as of feet. Straining my eye farther down, I clearly beheld at a distance the outline of some large building. It could not be mere natural rock, it was too symmetrical, with huge heavy Egyptian-like columns, and the whole lighted as from within. I had about me a small pocket-telescope, and by the aid of this I could distinguish, near the building I mention, two forms which seemed human, though I could not be sure. At least they were living, for they moved, and both vanished within the building. We now proceeded to attach the end of the rope we had brought with us to the ledge on which we stood, by the aid of clamps and grappling-hooks, with which, as well as with necessary tools, we were provided.

We were almost silent in our work. We toiled like men afraid to speak to each other. One end of the rope being thus apparently made firm to the ledge, the other, to which we fastened a fragment of the rock, rested on the ground below, a distance of some fifty feet. I was a younger and a more active man than my companion, and having served on board ship in my boyhood, this mode of transit was more familiar to me than to him. In a whisper I claimed the precedence, so that when I gained the ground I might serve to hold the rope more steady for his descent. I got safely to the ground beneath, and the engineer now began to lower himself. But he had scarcely accomplished ten feet of the descent, when the fastenings, which we had fancied so secure, gave way, or rather the rock itself proved treacherous and crumbled beneath the strain; and the unhappy man was precipitated to the bottom, falling just at my feet, and bringing down with his fall splinters of the rock, one of which, fortunately but a small one, struck and for the time stunned me. When I recovered my senses I saw my companion an inanimate mass beside me, life utterly extinct. While I was bending over his corpse in grief and horror, I heard close at hand a strange sound between a snort and a hiss; and turning instinctively to the quarter from which it came, I saw emerging from a dark fissure in the rock a vast and terrible head, with open jaws and dull, ghastly, hungry eyes--the head of a monstrous reptile resembling that of the crocodile or alligator, but infinitely larger than the largest creature of that kind I had ever beheld in my travels. I started to my feet and fled down the valley at my utmost speed. I stopped at last, ashamed of my panic and my flight, and returned to the spot on which I had left the body of my friend. It was gone; doubtless the monster had already drawn it into its den and devoured it. The rope and the grappling-hooks still lay where they had fallen, but they afforded me no chance of return: it was impossible to re-attach them to the rock above, and the sides of the rock were too sheer and smooth for human steps to clamber. I was alone in this strange world, amidst the bowels of the Earth."

But I would never, never do you wrong

I won't do that baby

Shame on you
Seducing everyone
You faded jewel
You diamond in the rough
You don't have to tell me
I know where you've been
Shining once again

[Verse 2]
Will you do
The thing you've always done
Tell me true
I think you know the one
One that makes me blurry
Colors start to run

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Every time I wonder
I go under
[Chorus]
The deeper the blues, the more I see black
Sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are black

[Verse 2]
How my mind is spinning
And my head is going numb
Right from the beginning
Our ending had begun
I can be your trouble
Shiver into you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shaking like the thunder
Sinking under

[Chorus]
The deeper the blues, the more I see black
Sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are, deepest blues are black

[Bridge]
When it comes closing in
Reject
Cause I gotta move
And the simple things get in the openings
Connect
Become something new
To remove
[Chorus]
The deeper the blues, the more I see black
Sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are, deepest blues are black
The deeper the blues, the more I see black
Sweeter the bruise, the feeling starts coming back
All the deepest blues are, deepest blues are black"

1071,"Chorus:

They call me the ""Dummy Man"" (man, man, man)
And I'm up early tryina slang my dope
(I'm the nigga with the biggest rocks)
The fiends...they get awfully mad....(mad, mad, mad)
When they go broke on dope and it's really soap
(My nigga you ain't never lied)

Verse 1:

Up in the morning....and I feel like I don't wanna be livin'
Better off dead without no bread....have you ever felt that feeling?
Unsatisfied, feelin' like you wanna die
When you reach into your pocket and can't even find
Not even enough to go purchase a dime (sack of weed)
But FUCK THAT! I got ""come up"" in my blood
Cause it's the ""1st of the Month"" (nigga what!)
The perfect time to come up
The only problem is: I'm broke and ain't got no dope
But as I was standin' in my bathroom mirror....I looked at the soap
Shit...soap look a little like dope (you scandalous nigga!)
Then, I chopped-chopped up me some counterfeit amphetamines
But wait a minute.....
Wait a minute now...what if they want to taste it?
Think quickly for cash: nigga dash to the kitchen, get the bread bag
Wrap that bread around some soap
Now I got the breadcrumb-dum-dum dope
It might sound funny, but it ain't no joke...
Cause doin this shit could get a nigga smoked, mayn
But FUCK IT! Young nigga gotta get them duckets
Hit the medicine cabinet for the final touches...
Orajel for the numbness
Then I hit the corner with a handful of breadcrumbs...
Nigga got the dum-dum for ya
And the pump on approach if you say it ain't dope
Only dealin cause I hate to be sober
Peep, ""creep on ah come up"", I wait for a fiend to roll up
And walk to the car with my hand on my pistol
He showed me the green, said
""Hold up...gotta get my stash""
Nigga need a 20...but I got that faded
Lovin these yum-yums, glad I made it;
I just hope this nigga don't try to taste it!
I dropped him the dummy, he said it was lovely
But as he pulled off, I pinned that he put the rock up in his mouth
(So he gon' come back for his money!)
I pinned that he braked...he skid...
Put it in reverse and he came back quick...
Fiend jumped out and he talkin' all big...
This is what happened to this bit....
We beat him and finished him off, and he never came 'round here no more
Cause a nigga ran into yours truly: poor, and a nigga scored
Lord forgive me but I can't remember (the last time I ate)
Now I gots to go get me a plate, or a bit, now I'm proper
Only spent three dollars and forty-four cents
Nigga full, now I gotta get bent
Nigga still got sixteen dollars and fifty-six cents...HELL YEAH!
These dum-dums got a nigga off the hook..they got booked, took, shook
Look: got dope but it ain't dope, so I guess you can call me a ""crooked crook""
Hey...do you know somebody like me?
I don't think so, cause ain't nobody I see
Down for the crime like I'm down for mine
And if I gotta, nigga I cheat
(cheat)
Chorus (x2)

So fuck with me, I got the chops mayn (chops mayn)
The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn)
Say fuck with me, I got tha chops mayn (the chopper, choppers)
The biggest rocks up on the block mayn (block mayn {echo})"
3299,"Every time I hear your name
It bears an uncanny resemblance to defeat
I never want to touch base
Because it's hard to face the things we've been
I don't remember the precious things
I still remember the ways you showed your worth
All of this breathing in
And never breathing out
I hope you feel the pull
It'll bring down to where I go
And that's what I know of life
Cuz it was all I was shown
What I know now
I could never go back to you

Disconnect and disconnect and disconnect
The heart aattack comes right back
Right where we left off
I point the gun too much
Fuck, you're such an easy target
I said I couldn't carry a goddamn thing
But you gave it anyway
Half-flattered you believed in me
Half-sorry you made a mistake
I hope it's cold in your room
Let the warmth lure you home
I hope it's cold in your room
And like a magnet it'll bring you home"

Cos there's a part of me always has to start a fight

Love's bitter mystery - hurts the one you need
It's a devil inside of me that takes control
It bites the hand that feeds

Last night just one word I threw it all away
I wish you'd never heard
And that I could turn the clocks back for one day
Love's bitter mystery hurts the one you need
It's a devil inside of me that takes control
It bites the hand that feeds
Hurts the one hurts the one you need
Bites the hand that feeds
Bite the hand bite the hand that feeds
Hurts the one you need

I want to turn on this control
I know it leads to self destruction
Turn it on tree my soul
I won't slave to these obstructions
Love's bitter mystery hurts the one you need
It's a devil inside of me that takes control
It bites the hand that feeds
Love's bitter mystery hurts the one you need
It's a devil inside of me that takes control
It bites the hand that feeds

Hurts the one hurts the one you need
Bites the hand that feeds
Bite the hand bite the hand that feeds
Hurts the one you need
Hurts the one hurts the one you need
Bites the hand that feeds"

2783,"Put your hand in the hand of our sweet Lord
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can now look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Every time I looked into the Holy Book, I wanna tremble
When I read about the carpenter's son who cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers
Were no different fellas than what I profess to be
And it causes me pain to know I'm not the person I should be

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can now look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

My momma taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
(When I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to keep)
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I be closest to Heaven
(If I should die before I wake, pray the Lord my soul to take)
Daddy lived his life with three kids and a wife, you do what you must do
But he taught me enough of what it takes in life to get through
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee"
4171,"One score for stepparents and the Seven Dwarves
Falling all over yourselves
To be the fairest in the land
Slavery to a cruel idol
Slavery to a hollow fable
Don't forget that your Aryan lust has led
To one hundred men hanging from trees amid the circling crows
And as only the obscure know, the tainted fruit never ends
They opened your mouth and they poured in the good of the land
Then they claimed and leashed you to their heavenly plan
Now the ghosts of a dead empire are written all over your face
Along with the failed ruins of their version of eternal grace"

With the ice cream truck song on the horizon

And it’s always the end of the world again
All the blood and the colors and the shades of pain
Our animal nature, our cynical nature
And it’s always the end of the world again
Head to toe in an unbreakable arithmetic
Our animal nature, our cynical nature

[Verse 2]
And they’re running us round into butter
Grinding us down into so much ash and dust
And they want us to make like tigers
Eating our own as we choke on the love we’ve lost
[Pre-Chorus]
There’s always killings to be made
A beautiful profit to turn from harm’s way

[Chorus]
And it’s always the end of the world again
All the blood and the colors and the shades of pain
Our animal nature, our cynical nature
And it’s always the end of the world again
Head to toe in an unbreakable arithmetic
Our animal nature, our cynical nature"

I don’t claim to have solutions, but I think I have ideas to start
Technology has become the new religion and it’s killing us

I kill em all move silent thru the fog it's evident

They desperate for some plays come and talk to big brother kid
You got the game fucked up
How you niggas catching plays while your daughter is getting caught up hungry starving for days

Tell em who you better than, I call this shit my

I’m not wasting away

I’ll make the most of my days
I’ll do the things that I hate
I’ll fill the potholes in my life
I’ll shoulder the weight

So what a 40 hour work week
On top of school but I won’t let it break me down
So now I’ll stick this out
Still making progress off this process
So when I catch up or catch a break
I won’t make the same mistakes
Good habits make them last
I can’t skip another class
Take a step in the right direction
Bought books used on these life lessons
I must have missed the day when the professor taught that page

I’ll shoulder the weight, (x2)

So what a 40 hour work week
On top of school but I won’t let it break me down
So now I’ll stick this out
Still making progress off this process

Strike back
I never really wanted that
True fact
I don’t know how to interact
With all these pieces in my life and how they don’t fit together
Now my days feel so long
I swear I won’t get this wrong
I’ll fix my GPA, can’t throw this all away
So by the end of the day I’ll make sure all my bills are paid

I changed how I’m feeling

So I changed how I’m living
Needed a meal
Tryna cook up a million
Too busy with giving
To learn how to get it
Too busy with water
To learn how to whip it
Too busy with business
To learn how to pick it
I picked it all up
Just to learn to stick wit it
I’m not a rapper
Or writer
Or poet
I just draw pictures in need of a voice
Kodak was telling you
Call on yo spirit
Niggas was jamming
But niggas ainn hear it
Too many more lyrics went over yo head
Juice wrld was yelling but now that he dead

She wanna nigga that’s telling her lies
Can’t even lie
It’s so hard to be honest
Not that its harder to tell you the truth
But when i do you gon turn it to pain
Couple of statements go over yo head
Burnt the umbrella to stay in the rain

What could i give i dont got nothing left
I don’t have anything left but a passion
Went out my way wasn’t looking for answers"

to know you, to love you, to hear your promises
I am powerless.  I'll play with you, defy not the composer
of love, lust, need, and desire; despite what my past says

please, I'm begging you now. can you not see?
broken mirrors of me, rightfully haunt me and forewarn
of hurt that follows this game you want to play with me
shattered reflections, pieces of me, not one whole left even to mourn

your smile draws me to the edge of a vast canyon below
your touch gives me illusions of taking flight and immortality
then the demon hope pushes me as in blissful ignorance I go
I cannot fly!  someone clipped my wings, a love bird's inevitable malady

I protest so much, transparent am I, my soul longs for love, I shall die
hope eternal lives on in me still, as our lips meet, our bodies bursting
with desire, the scent of love and sweet dreams we share, as side by side we
lie my heart is unleashed, my ears ache for your voice, for your lips I keep thirsting
my body yearns for your touch, my soul longs for your knowing.
of you, my love, I can't get enough; so love me long, love me now
blind my eyes with your beauty, quiet my doubts, let me leap unknowing
of the future I defy. Love has to continue for me with someone, somehow

your laughter tickles my very soul, your skin cools the fever in my head
just to spark heat somewhere else instead, hold me tonight, do not let go
let us love, laugh, talk, cry, and love some more; I know the past isn't dead
let us pretend it doesn't exist, that it cannot persist, once again let me know

the shelter of your arms, the excitement of your many charms, look in your eyes
and fear no more, this is forever, let the demons hope and let love push me to the edge
I will go willingly, surely there are love birds who can really take to the skies?
who knows maybe, we can be, the few who survive, because of the love we pledge

to be a safe haven for one another, to help, but not over-shadow each other, vowing..
to be friends as well as lovers, this much is different, from all the others, don't want out."
9451,"In Which Mr. Samuel Weller Begins To Devote His Energies

To The Return Match Between Himself And Mr. Trotter
In a small room in the vicinity of the stableyard, betimes in the morning, which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick's adventure with the middle—aged lady in the yellow curl-papers, sat Mr. Weller, senior, preparing himself for his journey to London. He was sitting in an excellent attitude for having his portrait taken; and here it is.

It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career, Mr. Weller's profile might have presented a bold and determined outline. His face, however, had expanded under the influence of good living, and a disposition remarkable for resignation; and its bold, fleshy curves had so far extended beyond the limits originally assigned them, that unless you took a full view of his countenance in front, it was difficult to distinguish more than the extreme tip of a very rubicund nose. His chin, from the same cause, had acquired the grave and imposing form which is generally described by prefixing the word 'double' to that expressive feature; and his complexion exhibited that peculiarly mottled combination of colours which is only to be seen in gentlemen of his profession, and in underdone roast beef. Round his neck he wore a crimson travelling-shawl, which merged into his chin by such imperceptible gradations, that it was difficult to distinguish the folds of the one, from the folds of the other. Over this, he mounted a long waistcoat of a broad pink-striped pattern, and over that again, a wide-skirted green coat, ornamented with large brass buttons, whereof the two which garnished the waist, were so far apart, that no man had ever beheld them both at the same time. His hair, which was short, sleek, and black, was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low-crowned brown hat. His legs were encased in knee-cord breeches, and painted top-boots; and a copper watch-chain, terminating in one seal, and a key of the same material, dangled loosely from his capacious waistband.

We have said that Mr. Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey to London—he was taking sustenance, in fact. On the table before him, stood a pot of ale, a cold round of beef, and a very respectable-looking loaf, to each of which he distributed his favours in turn, with the most rigid impartiality. He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter, when the footsteps of somebody entering the room, caused him to raise his head; and he beheld his son.

'Mornin', Sammy!' said the father.
The son walked up to the pot of ale, and nodding significantly to his parent, took a long draught by way of reply.

'Wery good power o' suction, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller the elder, looking into the pot, when his first-born had set it down half empty. 'You'd ha' made an uncommon fine oyster, Sammy, if you'd been born in that station o' life.'

'Yes, I des-say, I should ha' managed to pick up a respectable livin',' replied Sam applying himself to the cold beef, with considerable vigour.

'I'm wery sorry, Sammy,' said the elder Mr. Weller, shaking up the ale, by describing small circles with the pot, preparatory to drinking. 'I'm wery sorry, Sammy, to hear from your lips, as you let yourself be gammoned by that 'ere mulberry man. I always thought, up to three days ago, that the names of Veller and gammon could never come into contract, Sammy, never.'

'Always exceptin' the case of a widder, of course,' said Sam.

'Widders, Sammy,' replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour. 'Widders are 'ceptions to ev'ry rule. I have heerd how many ordinary women one widder's equal to in pint o' comin' over you. I think it's five-and-twenty, but I don't rightly know vether it ain't more.'
'Well; that's pretty well,' said Sam.

'Besides,' continued Mr. Weller, not noticing the interruption, 'that's a wery different thing. You know what the counsel said, Sammy, as defended the gen'l'm'n as beat his wife with the poker, venever he got jolly. ""And arter all, my Lord,"" says he, ""it's a amiable weakness."" So I says respectin' widders, Sammy, and so you'll say, ven you gets as old as me.'

'I ought to ha' know'd better, I know,' said Sam.

'Ought to ha' know'd better!' repeated Mr. Weller, striking the table with his fist. 'Ought to ha' know'd better! why, I know a young 'un as hasn't had half nor quarter your eddication—as hasn't slept about the markets, no, not six months—who'd ha' scorned to be let in, in such a vay; scorned it, Sammy.' In the excitement of feeling produced by this agonising reflection, Mr. Weller rang the bell, and ordered an additional pint of ale.
'Well, it's no use talking about it now,' said Sam. 'It's over, and can't be helped, and that's one consolation, as they always says in Turkey, ven they cuts the wrong man's head off. It's my innings now, gov'nor, and as soon as I catches hold o' this 'ere Trotter, I'll have a good 'un.'

'I hope you will, Sammy. I hope you will,' returned Mr. Weller. 'Here's your health, Sammy, and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you've inflicted on the family name.' In honour of this toast Mr. Weller imbibed at a draught, at least two-thirds of a newly-arrived pint, and handed it over to his son, to dispose of the remainder, which he instantaneously did.

'And now, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller, consulting a large double-faced silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain. 'Now it's time I was up at the office to get my vay-bill and see the coach loaded; for coaches, Sammy, is like guns—they requires to be loaded with wery great care, afore they go off.'

At this parental and professional joke, Mr. Weller, junior, smiled a filial smile. His revered parent continued in a solemn tone—

'I'm a-goin' to leave you, Samivel, my boy, and there's no telling ven I shall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha' been too much for me, or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o' the celebrated Mr. Veller o' the Bell Savage. The family name depends wery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you'll do wot's right by it. Upon all little pints o' breedin', I know I may trust you as vell as if it was my own self. So I've only this here one little bit of adwice to give you. If ever you gets to up'ards o' fifty, and feels disposed to go a-marryin' anybody—no matter who—jist you shut yourself up in your own room, if you've got one, and pison yourself off hand. Hangin's wulgar, so don't you have nothin' to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel, my boy, pison yourself, and you'll be glad on it arterwards.' With these affecting words, Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son, and turning slowly upon his heel, disappeared from his sight.

In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened, Mr. Samuel Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left him; and bending his steps towards St. Clement's Church, endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy, by strolling among its ancient precincts. He had loitered about, for some time, when he found himself in a retired spot—a kind of courtyard of venerable appearance—which he discovered had no other outlet than the turning by which he had entered. He was about retracing his steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance; and the mode and manner of this appearance, we now proceed to relate.
Mr. Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick houses now and then, in his deep abstraction, bestowing a wink upon some healthy-looking servant girl as she drew up a blind, or threw open a bedroom window, when the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened, and a man having emerged therefrom, closed the green gate very carefully after him, and walked briskly towards the very spot where Mr. Weller was standing.

Now, taking this, as an isolated fact, unaccompanied by any attendant circumstances, there was nothing very extraordinary in it; because in many parts of the world men do come out of gardens, close green gates after them, and even walk briskly away, without attracting any particular share of public observation. It is clear, therefore, that there must have been something in the man, or in his manner, or both, to attract Mr. Weller's particular notice. Whether there was, or not, we must leave the reader to determine, when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual in question.

When the man had shut the green gate after him, he walked, as we have said twice already, with a brisk pace up the courtyard; but he no sooner caught sight of Mr. Weller than he faltered, and stopped, as if uncertain, for the moment, what course to adopt. As the green gate was closed behind him, and there was no other outlet but the one in front, however, he was not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel Weller to get away. He therefore resumed his brisk pace, and advanced, staring straight before him. The most extraordinary thing about the man was, that he was contorting his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever were beheld. Nature's handiwork never was disguised with such extraordinary artificial carving, as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one moment.

'Well!' said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached. 'This is wery odd. I could ha' swore it was him.'
Up came the man, and his face became more frightfully distorted than ever, as he drew nearer.
'I could take my oath to that 'ere black hair and mulberry suit,' said Mr. Weller; 'only I never see such a face as that afore.'
As Mr. Weller said this, the man's features assumed an unearthly twinge, perfectly hideous. He was obliged to pass very near Sam, however, and the scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect, under all these appalling twists of feature, something too like the small eyes of Mr. Job Trotter to be easily mistaken.
'Hollo, you Sir!' shouted Sam fiercely.
The stranger stopped.

'Hollo!' repeated Sam, still more gruffly.

The man with the horrible face looked, with the greatest surprise, up the court, and down the court, and in at the windows of the houses—everywhere but at Sam Weller—and took another step forward, when he was brought to again by another shout.
'Hollo, you sir!' said Sam, for the third time.

There was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now, so the stranger, having no other resource, at last looked Sam Weller full in the face.
'It won't do, Job Trotter,' said Sam. 'Come! None o' that 'ere nonsense. You ain't so wery 'andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o' your good looks. Bring them 'ere eyes o' yourn back into their proper places, or I'll knock 'em out of your head. D'ye hear?'

As Mr. Weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this address, Mr. Trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural expression; and then giving a start of joy, exclaimed, 'What do I see? Mr. Walker!'
'Ah,' replied Sam. 'You're wery glad to see me, ain't you?'

'Glad!' exclaimed Job Trotter; 'oh, Mr. Walker, if you had but known how I have looked forward to this meeting! It is too much, Mr. Walker; I cannot bear it, indeed I cannot.' And with these words, Mr. Trotter burst into a regular inundation of tears, and, flinging his arms around those of Mr. Weller, embraced him closely, in an ecstasy of joy.
'Get off!' cried Sam, indignant at this process, and vainly endeavouring to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance. 'Get off, I tell you. What are you crying over me for, you portable engine?'

'Because I am so glad to see you,' replied Job Trotter, gradually releasing Mr. Weller, as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared. 'Oh, Mr. Walker, this is too much.'
'Too much!' echoed Sam, 'I think it is too much—rayther! Now, what have you got to say to me, eh?'

Mr. Trotter made no reply; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was in full force.
'What have you got to say to me, afore I knock your head off?' repeated Mr. Weller, in a threatening manner.

'Eh!' said Mr. Trotter, with a look of virtuous surprise.
'What have you got to say to me?'
'I, Mr. Walker!'
'Don't call me Valker; my name's Veller; you know that vell enough. What have you got to say to me?'

'Bless you, Mr. Walker—Weller, I mean—a great many things, if you will come away somewhere, where we can talk comfortably. If you knew how I have looked for you, Mr. Weller—'
'Wery hard, indeed, I s'pose?' said Sam drily.

'Very, very, Sir,' replied Mr. Trotter, without moving a muscle of his face. 'But shake hands, Mr. Weller.'

Sam eyed his companion for a few seconds, and then, as if actuated by a sudden impulse, complied with his request. 'How,' said Job Trotter, as they walked away, 'how is your dear, good master? Oh, he is a worthy gentleman, Mr. Weller! I hope he didn't catch cold, that dreadful night, Sir.'

There was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter's eye, as he said this, which ran a thrill through Mr. Weller's clenched fist, as he burned with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs. Sam constrained himself, however, and replied that his master was extremely well.

'Oh, I am so glad,' replied Mr. Trotter; 'is he here?'
'Is yourn?' asked Sam, by way of reply.
'Oh, yes, he is here, and I grieve to say, Mr. Weller, he is going on worse than ever.'
'Ah, ah!' said Sam.
'Oh, shocking—terrible!'
'At a boarding-school?' said Sam.
'No, not at a boarding-school,' replied Job Trotter, with the same sly look which Sam had noticed before; 'not at a boarding-school.'
'At the house with the green gate?' said Sam, eyeing his companion closely.
'No, no—oh, not there,' replied Job, with a quickness very unusual to him, 'not there.'
'What was you a-doin' there?' asked Sam, with a sharp glance. 'Got inside the gate by accident, perhaps?'

'Why, Mr. Weller,' replied Job, 'I don't mind telling you my little secrets, because, you know, we took such a fancy for each other when we first met. You recollect how pleasant we were that morning?'

'Oh, yes,' said Sam, impatiently. 'I remember. Well?'
'Well,' replied Job, speaking with great precision, and in the low tone of a man who communicates an important secret; 'in that house with the green gate, Mr. Weller, they keep a good many servants.'

'So I should think, from the look on it,' interposed Sam.
'Yes,' continued Mr. Trotter, 'and one of them is a cook, who has saved up a little money, Mr. Weller, and is desirous, if she can establish herself in life, to open a little shop in the chandlery way, you see.' 'Yes.'

'Yes, Mr. Weller. Well, Sir, I met her at a chapel that I go to; a very neat little chapel in this town, Mr. Weller, where they sing the number four collection of hymns, which I generally carry about with me, in a little book, which you may perhaps have seen in my hand—and I got a little intimate with her, Mr. Weller, and from that, an acquaintance sprung up between us, and I may venture to say, Mr. Weller, that I am to be the chandler.'

'Ah, and a wery amiable chandler you'll make,' replied Sam, eyeing Job with a side look of intense dislike.

'The great advantage of this, Mr. Weller,' continued Job, his eyes filling with tears as he spoke, 'will be, that I shall be able to leave my present disgraceful service with that bad man, and to devote myself to a better and more virtuous life; more like the way in which I was brought up, Mr. Weller.'

'You must ha' been wery nicely brought up,' said Sam.
'Oh, very, Mr. Weller, very,' replied Job. At the recollection of the purity of his youthful days, Mr. Trotter pulled forth the pink handkerchief, and wept copiously.
'You must ha' been an uncommon nice boy, to go to school vith,' said Sam.
'I was, sir,' replied Job, heaving a deep sigh; 'I was the idol of the place.'
'Ah,' said Sam, 'I don't wonder at it. What a comfort you must ha' been to your blessed mother.'

At these words, Mr. Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief into the corner of each eye, one after the other, and began to weep copiously.
'Wot's the matter with the man,' said Sam, indignantly. 'Chelsea water-works is nothin' to you. What are you melting vith now? The consciousness o' willainy?'
'I cannot keep my feelings down, Mr. Weller,' said Job, after a short pause. 'To think that my master should have suspected the conversation I had with yours, and so dragged me away in a post-chaise, and after persuading the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him, and bribing the school-mistress to do the same, deserted her for a better speculation! Oh! Mr. Weller, it makes me shudder.'

'Oh, that was the vay, was it?' said Mr. Weller.
'To be sure it was,' replied Job.

'Vell,' said Sam, as they had now arrived near the hotel, 'I vant to have a little bit o' talk with you, Job; so if you're not partickler engaged, I should like to see you at the Great White Horse to-night, somewheres about eight o'clock.'
'I shall be sure to come,' said Job.

'Yes, you'd better,' replied Sam, with a very meaning look, 'or else I shall perhaps be askin' arter you, at the other side of the green gate, and then I might cut you out, you know.'

'I shall be sure to be with you, sir,' said Mr. Trotter; and wringing Sam's hand with the utmost fervour, he walked away.

'Take care, Job Trotter, take care,' said Sam, looking after him, 'or I shall be one too many for you this time. I shall, indeed.' Having uttered this soliloquy, and looked after Job till he was to be seen no more, Mr. Weller made the best of his way to his master's bedroom.

'It's all in training, Sir,' said Sam.
'What's in training, Sam?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.
'I've found 'em out, Sir,' said Sam.
'Found out who?'

'That 'ere queer customer, and the melan-cholly chap with the black hair.'
'Impossible, Sam!' said Mr. Pickwick, with the greatest energy. 'Where are they, Sam: where are they?'

'Hush, hush!' replied Mr. Weller; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to dress, he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter.
'But when is this to be done, Sam?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.
'All in good time, Sir,' replied Sam.

Whether it was done in good time, or not, will be seen hereafter."

[Chorus]
Should I go out with a bang?
Hit the town
Wave my arms like Nixon on the lawn
When I call it a night

[Verse 2]
A real man wouldn't hesitate
But here I am, still busy plotting my escape

[Chorus]
Should I go without a whisper?
Keep it down
Just sit back like Elvis on the throne
When I call it a night
[Outro]
I'm afraid it'll take a bigger man than me
To put me out of my own misery"
7191,"And I

And I lay numb
Waiting for something worst to happen
Sweet innocence
It happened so suddenly

She crossed my path
On the way to nothingness
I knew that I was encountering
An angel of Purity
And in the process, I've quickly understood
That I dont deserve her
None of us humans do

Beholding such a fatality leaves you empty with bitter grief
Life seems to be tarnished and sour, raped in its very essence
But sorrow is rapidly replaced by frustration, envy, and despair

Dressed in white
A child so alone
So fragile and beautiful has dawn
To hold her close was exhilarating in a most vicious way
I felt so weak
Yet empowered somehow
One thing leading to another, I knew then
That if I could not experience nor possess Purity
I would at least try to take it and choke the life out of it

And I did
Oh, why
I don't know but I did

Violently, I've pummelled her face with my bare fists until she became awfully deformed
Bleeding and dying, all twisted up in terror

I have forcefully replaced every teeth in her mouth
By razorsharp shards of glass
Slowly inserting every piece
Of glass in the little one's gum

Why was I laughing?
Why was I laughing?
Why was I laughing?
Why... was I laughing?
Why?
In complete disharmony with her screams

I guess that is my art
To inflict upon Purity the only thing I can give
And, unfortunately, it's not love
I should've feel guilty, I know
But it simply didn't occur"
8934,"Days confused
Ruined by a past you hardly knew
The frost in your eyes
Irritated streams on others lost

These memories, it seems, cause cracks and one gets unglued
These tendrils proceed to strangle her reason too

Held apart
Every time is lost
But maybe once in a while
You'll catch 'em

When all the walls are brick
And all the racing's fixed
You'll change expression

Damned if you
Didn't hide your face I'm sure they knew
When thoughts cross your heart
Bypass all the strain of being you
When most people dream, their subconscious locks on you
You're wrapped in your scene, and blanket of things you drew

Don't be frightened, someone caught you napping
A knock on the door in advance didn't help this time

Every Sunday you look out the window
To count the tracks in the snow till they get back

Should it be so hard to have a nice day?
Should it be so hard to have a nice time?

Don't feel so worthless in the meanwhile (x2)"

Cuz in the bone same marrow that apartheid chased
The narrow margin with the haves and the have nots

Time to say goodbye and step off of it now
It's over, girl, it's over
So we go on and on, on this merry-go-round
Tryin' to chase a love that can never be found
Time to say goodbye and step off of it now
It's over, girl, it's over


[Chorus]
Let me see you cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
Cry, cry, cry
I need to see you cry, cry, cry
Until your tears run dry, dry, dry
Like the deserts need the rain
Want ya tears to fall down on me
[Outro]
I need to see you cry
I wanna, I wanna see you cry
Won't rest until I see you cry
Yeah, I cry, I cry, I cry"

We both just hit the floor
And I’m trying now
But I’m always wanting more

I know you never noticed me but that
Doesn’t mean I haven’t heard about you
Two lovers that can’t find the path
So tell me what it takes just to get to you

With the lights out
Nothing feels the same
You feel in front of me
But a thousand miles away

I know you never noticed me but that
Doesn’t mean I haven’t heard about you
Two lovers that can’t find the path
So tell me what it takes just to get to you

Yeah
Take me and all you did was break me I've been telling lies

You never ask me if I'm okay

In the red light back in 1985 I winked at the sly ruby in the eye
U try to deny the dialect rise so I emerge from a Maltese pie
And I’m a travelogue demigod that racists can’t catalogue
Eurocentric’s babble on in there own Babylon
Holding Beijing tea on my right knee
Defying hierarchy is my source of glee
Living next door to the halal and the kosher store
Pulling out my claw so u hate no more
I walk down the streets with groceries and sweets
Analysing judges and bigots on the beach
Down with the sounds sampling the cows
Hoping that they moo I know no bounds
So look inside my palm and you’ll see my past
And you’ll never have to ask what’s behind my mask

I’m irrelevant to development I’m just a key
Twisted stranger re arranger cry for me

[Verse 2: Hemlock Ernst]
Hang high heavy headed ready handed adversary
Kangrai bite from a Shanghai flight
Lip flip trip adipose my avid rose now savage prose
Tissue of a hybrid mind, Philipino bloodline
Drip from the north to the south shore eat sleep dream on a red eye
Thinking it was bedtime, now it’s bedbug plaqued tongue
Van broken down on a desert high
Unsung psalm, palm turn to back work shirt wet musty like an old dead dog
Red dead fog, move over landscape, hand over mandrake root
Bumpin chest plate, boy don’t shoot
Child raised idle in a world grown tidal, sine wave violent whirlpool
Green eyed girl, Mother Nature’s autograph on her calf
Finds solitude, in a birthmark spark, sun shower ark in the dark
We inhale from a dust we entail
Must we learn from the gust of the sail
Or the trust we impale
Death is just dishonest under veil
Paris is burning as various obstacles turning my culture to hodge podge abolishing my sense of self in the hopscotch and rah rah, they say that it’s blah blah, we know it as truth

[Verse 3: Atarangi]
Reinforce syrum of a vision delicate dreams persevear it’s a given over coming hard then we ---soft like a flock flying high from the mind of a prison
What about for the beat when it flows spitting dialog lost but I just don’t know how anymore
Thoughts of a wild ride settling truth for a howling inquisitive carnivorous shattering shackles apon doorstops limited
Forced to believe dwelling in gateways becoming a hinderance

Diversify innocence triumphantly despite a growing skeptisism between compulsion and purpose we conjure majestic solidarity keep rising striving to be free
Champions vanquish this choke hold my lover"

But nothing that can't be sung over 6 string, 12 frets
Cause every inch of love we ever had
Is stuck inside a suitcase and little plastic bag

Cause I will die
On the lonesome highway
And you can stare down from the mountain tops so high
And burn my beat down body with the fire in your eye
Cause I will die I will die I will die

And I made love
To the sun
On a Dark knight
On the run
And I kissed the Moon
On the tide
On a sea bound ship sailing on a river that had dried

The rain has stopped
For a little while
As the sky opens like the eyes of a child
But it’ll soon be done
Because nothing lasts forever
The wheel has spun the clouds unparted and every tie is severed
Cause I will die
On the lonesome highway
And you can stare down from the mountain tops so high
And burn my beat down body with the fire in your eye
Cause I will die I will die I will die

Hurry to the warmth
Of the burning fire
And throw your troubles and your woes onto the pyre
Pull out the thorns
Of the briar
And come to bed, lets retire and hear the voices of the choir

Stare down the stars
And imprint them in your mind
As the dark light washes over, let it shine
Only once we die
Will we feel true warmth
As we stare together out onto the light in the north

Cause I will die
On the lonesome highway
And you can stare down from the mountain tops so high
And burn my beat down body with the fire in your eye
Cause I will die I will die I will die
I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die I will die"

Momma always said, “I was her favorite mistake”
Poppa said, “I made it”, and he’s fuckin’ amazed
My sister begging me to get her friends backstage
Got a key to the city, and a street in my name
(I think I need my own parade
I think I need my own parade)
The club that wouldn’t let me in back in the days
Now the same motherfucker, where they beg me to play
They said I was a sinner, now they giving me praise
Got a key to the city, and a street in my name
(I think I need my own parade

[Verse 1: Murs]
It’s MursDay baby and don’t it sound so crazy?
Come on and hop up on the bandwagon
Grown men for the win no pants sagging
It’s an All-Souls Processional
Ain’t no question we true rap professionals
[Verse 2: Bernz]
I gotta smash on the radio, feeling so perennial
Feet on the couch while we talking to arsenio
Vixen from the video, calling me Emilio
Burning up a dab while she say she cooking my cereal
MursDay killing this shit we need our own parade
I'ma park this float out front and let the speakers play

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
We let the speakers play
Until the tweeters are leaking liters of senoritas
Sweet enough to ease the pain
Cause you know we gon’ slay
You need a ticket just to kick it, with the sickness
I be sippin', stickin’ meter maids
So get up and get off your damn barstool
MD’s leading the march, the grand marshals

[Verse 4: Murs]
You seen us on Youtube with tubas fam
Ain’t no questioning who’s who or who’s the man
Was hoping that you dudes would understand
Ain't no groupies just good dudes with true fans
You need a huge band when you got huge plans
To play your theme music and set the mood, damn

I think I need my own parade

[Verse 5: Bernz]
Spoils for the winners
Comps for the dinners
Drinks on the house
Toast to the heavy hitters
Got a tub full of Guinness
And some stars for my ninjas
A billion for my business
By the time a player finish
I'll be damned if I ain't in track to fill a trophy case
Hungry for success too long and now I gotta taste

[Verse 6: Murs]
And you can see my ego in orbit way out in outer space
Brand new Nikes on my feet with automatic lace
Most of the time I’m movin’ Off The Wall
Type of dude to stop mid verse because I got a call (phone rings)
What’s up girl?
Ya momma said it’s time to come home to show her
How to put our new album up on her iPhone

[Verse 7: Wrekonize]
And I clone billions of better vibes in my tone
Checks up in my mailbox, jack up in my time zone
Wrek comes expect domination
MursDay, we’re like a never-ending necknomination
Stacking up the shots for the sport and the fashion
Now that’s what the fuck I call a chain reaction
[Verse 8: Bernz]
Made the top of the food chain
All without new chains
Bump in the budget
Cuz the shit we make is butane
Hits for all my hitters
Villas for all my Gorrillas
Dancing with only Shakiras
While our enemies all fear us
I'mma have the whole city offline and
Marching at my pace
Hang on every line that I rhyme like monkeys in a cage

Now our peace will settle all
A myth so dreadful your soul will sag
From the weight it carries
I can hear their dreadful song
Unaware of death as they seek to face
The embrace that once was and all they needed
All will share a carrion fate

Be prepared for multiple deaths
Of all souls as hells rolls on
As hells rolls on the path of light we crumble
Every lamb in all worlds will be slaughtered
Remеmber back to the earliеst curse
The point from which all men did turn
Even man in his infancy stage
He did everything he could to dig his own grave
As he said, ""Suffer through the mist to forge your will and the world will surely come""

Deception our hallmark, our patient, our word
""Sapien"" their word to describe themselves as wise man
Blanket lies to conceal the truth that they we're but only blind men
Lucifer - the bringer of all light bearers
Solemn truth for all
Take - come forth - these sacraments of Braktal O'Minn and all
That the angels came from bastion's gaze of the hot lukewarm calls
Lick the blade but once again
Shed no tears for your fallen kin
And make haste to make proper and join within
The Fold - the legions of the damned (at best)
As we invade the duress of all heaven and the Seraphim's halls
The day as come
The final reckoning of the will of the black and his fallen minions

Well put to use macrologies to conquer earth
Keeping in mind our advantage

Behind his back - a pistol - here comes a beating
His suit, his silk, flower / but my razor is faster

Looking for a new technique
They never believe I put my weapons down
Another page turns in the book
Another one falls on their knees to the ground

A message from the tiger & she shivered like chord on a harp:
""the bedroom must be returned to its original sailor""
She reached for the lipstick from her handbag
On the edge of the sink

3183,"WHEN Boo Radley shuffled to his feet, light from the living-room windows glistened on his forehead. Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He coughed his dreadful raling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. His hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He coughed into it, then he wiped his forehead.

Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound.

Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded towards the front door.

‘You’d like to say good night to Jem, wouldn’t you, Mr Arthur? Come right in.’

I led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jem’s bed. ‘Come in, Arthur,’ she said. ‘He’s still asleep. Dr Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative. Jean Louise, is your father in the living-room?’

‘Yes ma’am, I think so.’

‘I’ll just go speak to him a minute. Dr Reynolds left some …’ her voice trailed away.

Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering from a distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness. I tugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jem’s bed.

Dr Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jem’s arm, to keep the cover off, I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid curiosity was on his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth was slightly open, and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boo’s hand came up, but he let it drop to his side.

‘You can pet him, Mr Arthur, he’s asleep. You couldn’t if he was awake, though, he wouldn’t let you …’ I found myself explaining. ‘Go ahead.’

Boo’s hand hovered over Jem’s head.
‘Go on, sir, he’s asleep.’

His hand came down lightly on Jem’s hair.

I was beginning to learn his body English. His hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave.

I led him to the front porch, where his uneasy steps halted. He was still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go.

‘Will you take me home?’

He almost whispered it, in the voice of a child afraid of the dark.

I put my foot on the top step and stopped. I would lead him through our house, but I would never lead him home.

‘Mr Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. That’s right, sir.’

I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm.

He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie Crawford was watching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down the sidewalk, as any gentleman would do.

We came to the street light on the corner, and I wondered how many times Dill had stood there hugging the fat pole, watching waiting, hoping. I wondered how many times Jem and I had made this journey, but I entered the Radley front gate for the second time in my life. Boo and I walked up the steps to the porch. His fingers found the front door-knob. He gently released my hand, opened the door, went inside, and shut the door behind him. I never saw him again.

Neighbours bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between. Boo was our neighbour. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair of good-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbours give in return. We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.

I turned to go home. Street lights winked down the street all the way to town. I had never seen our neighbourhood from this angle. There were Miss Maudie’s, Miss Stephanie’s – there was our house, I could see the porch swing – Miss Rachel’s house was beyond us, plainly visible. I could even see Mrs Dubose’s.
I looked behind me. To the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window. I walked to it, stood in front of it, and turned around. In daylight, I thought, you could see to the post office corner.

Daylight… in my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighbourhood was busy. Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. Miss Maudie bent over her azaleas. It was summertime, and two children scampered down the sidewalk towards a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and the children raced each other to him.

It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishing-pole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on his hips. Summertime, and his children played in the front yard with their friend, enacting a strange little drama of their own invention.

It was fall, and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of Mrs Dubose’s. The boy helped his sister to her feet, and they made their way home. Fall, and his children trotted to and fro around the corner, the day’s woes and triumphs on their faces. They stopped at an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive.

Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing house. Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a dog.

Summer, and he watched his children’s heart break. Autumn again, and Boo’s children needed him.

Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my way home, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way home, I thought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. He’d be so mad he missed it he wouldn’t speak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grown but there wasn’t much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.

I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and Atticus’s room was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in Jem’s room, sitting by his bed. He was reading a book.

‘Is Jem awake yet?’

‘Sleeping peacefully. He won’t be awake until morning.’

‘Oh. Are you sittin’ up with him?’

‘Just for an hour or so. Go to bed. Scout. You’ve had a long day.’
‘Well, I think I’ll stay with you for a while.’

‘Suit yourself,’ said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled by his amiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat down I began to feel sleepy.

‘Whatcha readin’?’ I asked.

Atticus turned the book over. ‘Something of Jem’s. Called The Gray Ghost.’

I was suddenly awake. ‘Why’d you get that one?’

‘Honey, I don’t know. Just picked it up. One of the few things I haven’t read,’ he said pointedly.

‘Read it out loud, please, Atticus. It’s real scary.’

‘No,’ he said. ‘You’ve had enough scaring for a while. This is too—’

‘Atticus, I wasn’t scared.’

He raised his eyebrows, and I protested: ‘Leastways not till I started telling Mr Tate about it. Jem wasn’t scared. Asked him and he said he wasn’t. Besides, nothin’s real scary except in books.’

Atticus opened his mouth to say something, but shut it again. He took his thumb from the middle of the book and turned back to the first page. I moved over and leaned my head against his knee. ‘H’rm,’ he said. ‘The Gray Ghost, by Seckatary Hawkins, Chapter One …’

I willed myself to stay awake, but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm and his voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept.

Seconds later, it seemed, his shoe was gently nudging my ribs. He lifted me to my feet and walked me to my room. ‘Heard every word you said,’ I muttered. ‘… wasn’t sleep at all, ’s about a ship an’ Three-Fingered Fred ’n’ Stoner’s Boy…’

He unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off. He held me up with one hand and reached for my pyjamas with the other.

‘Yeah, an’ they all thought it was Stoner’s Boy messin’ up their clubhouse an’ throwin’ ink all over it an’…’

He guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs and put me under the cover.

‘An’ they chased him ’n’ never could catch him ’cause they didn’t know what he looked like, an’ Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadn’t done any of those things … Atticus, he was real nice…’

His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me.

""Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.’

He turned out the light and went into Jem’s room. He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning."

There he goes, tonight's man
The one who's putting gods smile back upon my hands

Big man on the avenue becomes mommy's little speed bump
And this punk was easy, must've hated spinach
And the pigs all smiled they never like you to begin with

But it never once escaped my mind
To know the burden of living was just too much on my plate
Confounded chaos
Still I kept the road under my feet
But the laws of this world take away from me
The burden of waking up is still creeping over me
Still the leaves turn another day
I'm sick of living just for the sake of living another fucking day

I was told a long time ago that
Drinking is like taking happiness from tomorrow
So I drank every single day until there was none left to borrow
And they say I did it to myself
So maybe that makes me a failure
But I refuse to give up, I'm an expert at getting knocked down
I guess you could call it growing up
But, maybe that makes me a failure
Still I refuse to give up

Say you ain’t looking for a main chick, you just wanna have a good time
You’ve just seen her in the back with a next man and her best friend's giving you the eye
Now you're watching weighing up the situation
Thinking bout giving it a Bligh (yeah-yeah)
Now the voices in your head’s saying
“Show her you're the man, who's prang? Who’s he mugging? For I rush him wit my gang!”
If a hitter blap me I blap back at em!

Swear down I nearly took my own life, fam

Yo, I could show man about stress, everywhere stress, why am I still here? Stress
Jammz done briefed you about them bars but I could break it down in a whole lesson
Look, It's well known I keep a good vibe on me
If you show me respect you know I show it back

Called me Shrek and now Fiona wants to get attached

Watch her bounce back of the wall
Know a couple man didn’t wanna see me win though
From day I should’a known they were fraud
Let me say just because you got them man there in your phonebook
Doesn’t guarantee they ride out when you get jooked
Certain man are hiding under cars when it gets busy
You don’t wanna die in the streets, stack Lizzie
I made my mind up when I was young
When the force drove up I nearly got my chest bun like
“Na-na-nah” there’s no “gun on us”
We don’t see them, bare skeng talk we don’t believe them
Round up your bully vans and leave then, like...

And the sad season cypress wears, and rue;
Then, when the wind is moaning in the flue,
And ways are dark, bid Chaucer make us gay.
But now a little sadness!  All too sweet
This springtide riot, this most poignant air,
This sensuous sphere of color and perfume!

Whose bridal bed was builded in a tomb."

Fires, these fires
They burn for us
With a love that won't go easily
It burns in the dark
Hide these fires
They burn for us
And the love we have will be enough
If we both chose to love

Gerontocracy’s don't speak for youth

Forsaking all our human rights
Why didn't we see this?
All victims of this wretched blight
There's no forgiveness
So see this!

Crawl through the ashes and witness their kingdom
This nuclear empire that swallows our freedom
Confines our vision with invisible prisons
Speaks of peace but bathes our streets scarlet and crimson

Open your eyes you'll realize
The lies and the vacant sunrise
Accept your demise
Sever our ties to half-lives
Tear their empire down
Retain peace and hope this time around
Pave out the way
For Crimson streets to fade to grey
Feel our bite
When we unite
We are the light

Set up in a park like a Sunday League fixture

You're not harder, whip up your armour
I strike first, I don't believe in karma
Double tap to your heart like it was Insta
This ain't Syria, ayy, but when it comes to licking shots, that
That is what my squad dem are into
Big fish in a little pond, I'll reel you in
Hook, line and sinker
This ain't a game, I ain't tryna end up
In a cell and I ain't talking splinter

Somebody tell me why this donny's tryna hype
If I see him in the ends, we're guaranteed to fight
That final round
Will hit him in his chest and I'll leave your left looking alright
He was talking bad online
So I guess when I seen him, it was on sight
I be writing bars all hours of the night
Sick knifework like I am Wesley Snipes
This flow that I spit with, yeah, I'm the founder
When I drop 16s on vids, turn gang dem
And break the YouTube view counter
Watch the strap burst, body in a hearse
I always attack first, never have to counter
Ch-ch-ch, cock it back, f-f-f
Aim for your top right, rudeboy, like Robbie Fowler
Complete artist, I'm an all-rounder
Burning before Bobby Shmurda was hot
Talking your rubbish, I'll come to your block
About you're gonna put a hole in my top
It's not a D Double E ting, bare excuses
Budubupbup and then he got dropped
Didn't catch a sentence, but I put a full to a stop
I'll take him out the picture with big tools
And believe me, blud, I ain't talking crop
Like an intruder
People are tryna pitch me like I'm Luka
Man said he's gonna headtop me
Oh my god, it's another internet shooter
He said he's got a new 'matic
And with this new 'matic, rudeboy, I will shoot ya
So I said ""do ya?"", went to his yard
The only new 'matic I saw was Henry the hoover
D Double E said bullets are flying diagonal
But our kid will make sure they go straight through ya
My squad's serious like Jamie Adenuga
Drrrrsssh but I'm not Flirta
Box up a man, get me like Bruza
I let the ting beat with tekkers
But it ain't sounds of the Sir, it's sounds of the Luger
Polish gunner and it's not Szczęsny
Since GCSEs, you couldn't test me
I've got the upper hand, give him an uppercut and
He'll never land just like Wesley
Polish dons, yeah, I've got plenty
If I drop him five bills, it could get messy

I came with the ultimate team
And I didn't have to bring Messi
I just had to take the instrumental in right there
Reloads upon reloads, I get bare

Gotta look a lil' dirty when you swingin the toast

And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling

So when the weekend comes, I go get live with the honeys

I wink my eye, she got in my ride went to the club, it was jumping
Introduced myself as dogg and she said you're a liar
I said I got it going on baby doll and I'm on fire
I took her to the hotel, she said you're the king
I said be my queen, if you know what I mean
And let us do the wild thing

Wild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing

Please baby, baby, please
Shopping at the mall, looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled
And said, you have plans for tonight
I said, hopefully if things go well
I'll be with you tonight
So we journey to her house, one thing led to another
I key the door, we go hit the floor
I looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say, I was hanging by a string
She said, hey you 2, I was once like you
And I like to do the wild thing
Wild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
She love to do the wild thing, wild thing

Please baby, baby, please
... in effect, hanging out is always hype
And when me and my crew leave the shit ding
I want a girl who's just my type
I saw this lustious little freak, I ain't lying fellows, she was fine
This ... gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
I took her to my limousine, that was still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur, when it was over
I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my check, he was like static clean
But that's what happens when bodies start slapping
From doing the wild thing

Wild thing
She love to do the wild thing, wild thing
Please baby, baby, please
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
Wild thing, wild thing, wild thing, wild thing
She wanna do the wild thing, wild thing, wild thing

Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my ****** still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

7600,"2 Nephi 8:1
Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness. Look
unto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit
from whence ye are digged.

2 Nephi 8:2
Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare
you; for I called him alone, and blessed him.

2 Nephi 8:3
For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste
places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert
like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found
therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.

2 Nephi 8:4
Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation;
for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to
rest for a light for the people.

2 Nephi 8:5
My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
arm shall judge the people. The isles shall wait upon me, and on
mine arm shall they trust.
2 Nephi 8:6
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein
shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and
my righteousness shall not be abolished.

2 Nephi 8:7
Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
whose heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of
men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

2 Nephi 8:8
For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall be forever,
and my salvation from generation to generation.

2 Nephi 8:9
Awake, awake! Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in
the ancient days. Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and
wounded the dragon?

2 Nephi 8:10
Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the
great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
ransomed to pass over?
2 Nephi 8:11
Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come
with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be
upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow
and mourning shall flee away.

2 Nephi 8:12
I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you. Behold, who art
thou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of
the son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?

2 Nephi 8:13
And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth
the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast
feared continually every day, because of the fury of the
oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury
of the oppressor?

2 Nephi 8:14
The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that
he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

2 Nephi 8:15
But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared; the Lord of
Hosts is my name.
2 Nephi 8:16
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee
in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay
the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art
my people.

2 Nephi 8:17
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
hand of the Lord the cup of his fury—thou hast drunken the dregs
of the cup of trembling wrung out—

2 Nephi 8:18
And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought
forth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she
hath brought up.

2 Nephi 8:19
These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for
thee—thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the
sword—and by whom shall I comfort thee?

2 Nephi 8:20
Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head
of all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the
fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.

2 Nephi 8:21
Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not
with wine:

2 Nephi 8:22
Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause
of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more
drink it again.

2 Nephi 8:23
But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
who have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over—and
thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them
that went over.

2 Nephi 8:24
Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth
there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
unclean.

2 Nephi 8:25
Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem;
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of
Zion."

8452,"Bodies that strike the eyes, awaking sight.
From certain things flow odours evermore,
As cold from rivers, heat from sun, and spray
From waves of ocean, eater-out of walls
Around the coasts. Nor ever cease to flit
The varied voices, sounds athrough the air.
Then too there comes into the mouth at times
The wet of a salt taste, when by the sea
We roam about; and so, whene'er we watch
The wormword being mixed, its bitter stings.
To such degree from all things is each thing
Borne streamingly along, and sent about
To every region round; and nature grants
Nor rest nor respite of the onward flow,
Since 'tis incessantly we feeling have,
And all the time are suffered to descry
And smell all things at hand, and hear them sound.
Besides, since shape examined by our hands
Within the dark is known to be the same
As that by eyes perceived within the light
And lustrous day, both touch and sight must be
By one like cause aroused. So, if we test
A square and get its stimulus on us
Within the dark, within the light what square
Can fall upon our sight, except a square
That images the things? Wherefore it seems
The source of seeing is in images,
Nor without these can anything be viewed.
Now these same films I name are borne about
And tossed and scattered into regions all.
But since we do perceive alone through eyes,
It follows hence that whitherso we turn
Our sight, all things do strike against it there
With form and hue. And just how far from us
Each thing may be away, the image yields
To us the power to see and chance to tell:
For when 'tis sent, at once it shoves ahead
And drives along the air that's in the space
Betwixt it and our eyes. And thus this air
All glides athrough our eyeballs, and, as 'twere,
Brushes athrough our pupils and thuswise
Passes across. Therefore it comes we see
How far from us each thing may be away,
And the more air there be that's driven before,
And too the longer be the brushing breeze
Against our eyes, the farther off removed
Each thing is seen to be: forsooth, this work
With mightily swift order all goes on,
So that upon one instant we may see
What kind the object and how far away.

Nor over-marvellous must this be deemed
In these affairs that, though the films which strike
Upon the eyes cannot be singly seen,
The things themselves may be perceived. For thus
When the wind beats upon us stroke by stroke
And when the sharp cold streams, 'tis not our wont
To feel each private particle of wind
Or of that cold, but rather all at once;
And so we see how blows affect our body,
As if one thing were beating on the same
And giving us the feel of its own body
Outside of us. Again, whene'er we thump
With finger-tip upon a stone, we touch
But the rock's surface and the outer hue,
Nor feel that hue by contact—rather feel
The very hardness deep within the rock.
Now come, and why beyond a looking-glass
An image may be seen, perceive. For seen
It soothly is, removed far within.
'Tis the same sort as objects peered upon
Outside in their true shape, whene'er a door
Yields through itself an open peering-place,
And lets us see so many things outside
Beyond the house. Also that sight is made
By a twofold twin air: for first is seen
The air inside the door-posts; next the doors,
The twain to left and right; and afterwards
A light beyond comes brushing through our eyes,
Then other air, then objects peered upon
Outside in their true shape. And thus, when first
The image of the glass projects itself,
As to our gaze it comes, it shoves ahead
And drives along the air that's in the space
Betwixt it and our eyes, and brings to pass
That we perceive the air ere yet the glass.
But when we've also seen the glass itself,
Forthwith that image which from us is borne
Reaches the glass, and there thrown back again
Comes back unto our eyes, and driving rolls
Ahead of itself another air, that then
'Tis this we see before itself, and thus
It looks so far removed behind the glass.
Wherefore again, again, there's naught for wonder
In those which render from the mirror's plane
A vision back, since each thing comes to pass
By means of the two airs. Now, in the glass
The right part of our members is observed
Upon the left, because, when comes the image
Hitting against the level of the glass,
'Tis not returned unshifted; but forced off
Backwards in line direct and not oblique,—
Exactly as whoso his plaster-mask
Should dash, before 'twere dry, on post or beam,
And it should straightway keep, at clinging there,
Its shape, reversed, facing him who threw,
And so remould the features it gives back:
It comes that now the right eye is the left,
The left the right. An image too may be
From mirror into mirror handed on,
Until of idol-films even five or six
Have thus been gendered. For whatever things
Shall hide back yonder in the house, the same,
However far removed in twisting ways,
May still be all brought forth through bending paths
And by these several mirrors seen to be
Within the house, since nature so compels
All things to be borne backward and spring off
At equal angles from all other things.
To such degree the image gleams across
From mirror unto mirror; where 'twas left
It comes to be the right, and then again
Returns and changes round unto the left.
Again, those little sides of mirrors curved
Proportionate to the bulge of our own flank
Send back to us their idols with the right
Upon the right; and this is so because
Either the image is passed on along
From mirror unto mirror, and thereafter,
When twice dashed off, flies back unto ourselves;
Or else the image wheels itself around,
When once unto the mirror it has come,
Since the curved surface teaches it to turn
To usward. Further, thou might'st well believe
That these film-idols step along with us
And set their feet in unison with ours
And imitate our carriage, since from that
Part of a mirror whence thou hast withdrawn
Straightway no images can be returned.

Further, our eye-balls tend to flee the bright
And shun to gaze thereon; the sun even blinds,
If thou goest on to strain them unto him,
Because his strength is mighty, and the films
Heavily downward from on high are borne
Through the pure ether and the viewless winds,
And strike the eyes, disordering their joints.
So piecing lustre often burns the eyes,
Because it holdeth many seeds of fire
Which, working into eyes, engender pain.
Again, whatever jaundiced people view
Becomes wan-yellow, since from out their bodies
Flow many seeds wan-yellow forth to meet
The films of things, and many too are mixed
Within their eye, which by contagion paint
All things with sallowness. Again, we view
From dark recesses things that stand in light,
Because, when first has entered and possessed
The open eyes this nearer darkling air,
Swiftly the shining air and luminous
Followeth in, which purges then the eyes
And scatters asunder of that other air
The sable shadows, for in large degrees
This air is nimbler, nicer, and more strong.
And soon as ever 'thas filled and oped with light
The pathways of the eyeballs, which before
Black air had blocked, there follow straightaway
Those films of things out-standing in the light,
Provoking vision—what we cannot do
From out the light with objects in the dark,
Because that denser darkling air behind
Followeth in, and fills each aperture
And thus blockades the pathways of the eyes
That there no images of any things
Can be thrown in and agitate the eyes.

And when from far away we do behold
The squared towers of a city, oft
Rounded they seem,—on this account because
Each distant angle is perceived obtuse,
Or rather it is not perceived at all;
And perishes its blow nor to our gaze
Arrives its stroke, since through such length of air
Are borne along the idols that the air
Makes blunt the idol of the angle's point
By numerous collidings. When thuswise
The angles of the tower each and all
Have quite escaped the sense, the stones appear
As rubbed and rounded on a turner's wheel—
Yet not like objects near and truly round,
But with a semblance to them, shadowily.
Likewise, our shadow in the sun appears
To move along and follow our own steps
And imitate our carriage—if thou thinkest
Air that is thus bereft of light can walk,
Following the gait and motion of mankind.
For what we use to name a shadow, sure
Is naught but air deprived of light. No marvel:
Because the earth from spot to spot is reft
Progressively of light of sun, whenever
In moving round we get within its way,
While any spot of earth by us abandoned
Is filled with light again, on this account
It comes to pass that what was body's shadow
Seems still the same to follow after us
In one straight course. Since, evermore pour in
New lights of rays, and perish then the old,
Just like the wool that's drawn into the flame.
Therefore the earth is easily spoiled of light
And easily refilled and from herself
Washeth the black shadows quite away.

And yet in this we don't at all concede
That eyes be cheated. For their task it is
To note in whatsoever place be light,
In what be shadow: whether or no the gleams
Be still the same, and whether the shadow which
Just now was here is that one passing thither,
Or whether the facts be what we said above,
'Tis after all the reasoning of mind
That must decide; nor can our eyeballs know
The nature of reality. And so
Attach thou not this fault of mind to eyes,
Nor lightly think our senses everywhere
Are tottering. The ship in which we sail
Is borne along, although it seems to stand;
The ship that bides in roadstead is supposed
There to be passing by. And hills and fields
Seem fleeing fast astern, past which we urge
The ship and fly under the bellying sails.
The stars, each one, do seem to pause, affixed
To the ethereal caverns, though they all
Forever are in motion, rising out
And thence revisiting their far descents
When they have measured with their bodies bright
The span of heaven. And likewise sun and moon
Seem biding in a roadstead,—objects which,
As plain fact proves, are really borne along.
Between two mountains far away aloft
From midst the whirl of waters open lies
A gaping exit for the fleet, and yet
They seem conjoined in a single isle.
When boys themselves have stopped their spinning round,
The halls still seem to whirl and posts to reel,
Until they now must almost think the roofs
Threaten to ruin down upon their heads.
And now, when nature begins to lift on high
The sun's red splendour and the tremulous fires,
And raise him o'er the mountain-tops, those mountains—
O'er which he seemeth then to thee to be,
His glowing self hard by atingeing them
With his own fire—are yet away from us
Scarcely two thousand arrow-shots, indeed
Oft scarce five hundred courses of a dart;
Although between those mountains and the sun
Lie the huge plains of ocean spread beneath
The vasty shores of ether, and intervene
A thousand lands, possessed by many a folk
And generations of wild beasts. Again,
A pool of water of but a finger's depth,
Which lies between the stones along the pave,
Offers a vision downward into earth
As far, as from the earth o'erspread on high
The gulfs of heaven; that thus thou seemest to view
Clouds down below and heavenly bodies plunged
Wondrously in heaven under earth.
Then too, when in the middle of the stream
Sticks fast our dashing horse, and down we gaze
Into the river's rapid waves, some force
Seems then to bear the body of the horse,
Though standing still, reversely from his course,
And swiftly push up-stream. And wheresoe'er
We cast our eyes across, all objects seem
Thus to be onward borne and flow along
In the same way as we. A portico,
Albeit it stands well propped from end to end
On equal columns, parallel and big,
Contracts by stages in a narrow cone,
When from one end the long, long whole is seen,—
Until, conjoining ceiling with the floor,
And the whole right side with the left, it draws
Together to a cone's nigh-viewless point.
To sailors on the main the sun he seems
From out the waves to rise, and in the waves
To set and bury his light—because indeed
They gaze on naught but water and the sky.
Again, to gazers ignorant of the sea,
Vessels in port seem, as with broken poops,
To lean upon the water, quite agog;
For any portion of the oars that's raised
Above the briny spray is straight, and straight
The rudders from above. But other parts,
Those sunk, immersed below the water-line,
Seem broken all and bended and inclined
Sloping to upwards, and turned back to float
Almost atop the water. And when the winds
Carry the scattered drifts along the sky
In the night-time, then seem to glide along
The radiant constellations 'gainst the clouds
And there on high to take far other course
From that whereon in truth they're borne. And then,
If haply our hand be set beneath one eye
And press below thereon, then to our gaze
Each object which we gaze on seems to be,
By some sensation twain—then twain the lights
Of lampions burgeoning in flowers of flame,
And twain the furniture in all the house,
Two-fold the visages of fellow-men,
And twain their bodies. And again, when sleep
Has bound our members down in slumber soft
And all the body lies in deep repose,
Yet then we seem to self to be awake
And move our members; and in night's blind gloom
We think to mark the daylight and the sun;
And, shut within a room, yet still we seem
To change our skies, our oceans, rivers, hills,
To cross the plains afoot, and hear new sounds,
Though still the austere silence of the night
Abides around us, and to speak replies,
Though voiceless. Other cases of the sort
Wondrously many do we see, which all
Seek, so to say, to injure faith in sense—
In vain, because the largest part of these
Deceives through mere opinions of the mind,
Which we do add ourselves, feigning to see
What by the senses are not seen at all.
For naught is harder than to separate
Plain facts from dubious, which the mind forthwith
Adds by itself.

       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp               Again, if one suppose
That naught is known, he knows not whether this
Itself is able to be known, since he
Confesses naught to know. Therefore with him
I waive discussion—who has set his head
Even where his feet should be. But let me grant
That this he knows,—I question: whence he knows
What 'tis to know and not-to-know in turn,
And what created concept of the truth,
And what device has proved the dubious
To differ from the certain?—since in things
He's heretofore seen naught of true. Thou'lt find
That from the senses first hath been create
Concept of truth, nor can the senses be
Rebutted. For criterion must be found
Worthy of greater trust, which shall defeat
Through own authority the false by true;
What, then, than these our senses must there be
Worthy a greater trust? Shall reason, sprung
From some false sense, prevail to contradict
Those senses, sprung as reason wholly is
From out the senses?—For lest these be true,
All reason also then is falsified.
Or shall the ears have power to blame the eyes,
Or yet the touch the ears? Again, shall taste
Accuse this touch or shall the nose confute
Or eyes defeat it? Methinks not so it is:
For unto each has been divided off
Its function quite apart, its power to each;
And thus we're still constrained to perceive
The soft, the cold, the hot apart, apart
All divers hues and whatso things there be
Conjoined with hues. Likewise the tasting tongue
Has its own power apart, and smells apart
And sounds apart are known. And thus it is
That no one sense can e'er convict another.
Nor shall one sense have power to blame itself,
Because it always must be deemed the same,
Worthy of equal trust. And therefore what
At any time unto these senses showed,
The same is true. And if the reason be
Unable to unravel us the cause
Why objects, which at hand were square, afar
Seemed rounded, yet it more availeth us,
Lacking the reason, to pretend a cause
For each configuration, than to let
From out our hands escape the obvious things
And injure primal faith in sense, and wreck
All those foundations upon which do rest
Our life and safety. For not only reason
Would topple down; but even our very life
Would straightaway collapse, unless we dared
To trust our senses and to keep away
From headlong heights and places to be shunned
Of a like peril, and to seek with speed
Their opposites! Again, as in a building,
If the first plumb-line be askew, and if
The square deceiving swerve from lines exact,
And if the level waver but the least
In any part, the whole construction then
Must turn out faulty—shelving and askew,
Leaning to back and front, incongruous,
That now some portions seem about to fall,
And falls the whole ere long—betrayed indeed
By first deceiving estimates: so too
Thy calculations in affairs of life
Must be askew and false, if sprung for thee
From senses false. So all that troop of words
Marshalled against the senses is quite vain.

And now remains to demonstrate with ease
How other senses each their things perceive.

Firstly, a sound and every voice is heard,
When, getting into ears, they strike the sense
With their own body. For confess we must
Even voice and sound to be corporeal,
Because they're able on the sense to strike.
Besides voice often scrapes against the throat,
And screams in going out do make more rough
The wind-pipe—naturally enough, methinks,
When, through the narrow exit rising up
In larger throng, these primal germs of voice
Have thus begun to issue forth. In sooth,
Also the door of the mouth is scraped against
[By air blown outward] from distended [cheeks].

And thus no doubt there is, that voice and words
Consist of elements corporeal,
With power to pain. Nor art thou unaware
Likewise how much of body's ta'en away,
How much from very thews and powers of men
May be withdrawn by steady talk, prolonged
Even from the rising splendour of the morn
To shadows of black evening,—above all
If 't be outpoured with most exceeding shouts.
Therefore the voice must be corporeal,
Since the long talker loses from his frame
A part.

       &nbsp      Moreover, roughness in the sound
Comes from the roughness in the primal germs,
As a smooth sound from smooth ones is create;
Nor have these elements a form the same
When the trump rumbles with a hollow roar,
As when barbaric Berecynthian pipe
Buzzes with raucous boomings, or when swans
By night from icy shores of Helicon
With wailing voices raise their liquid dirge.

Thus, when from deep within our frame we force
These voices, and at mouth expel them forth,
The mobile tongue, artificer of words,
Makes them articulate, and too the lips
By their formations share in shaping them.
Hence when the space is short from starting-point
To where that voice arrives, the very words
Must too be plainly heard, distinctly marked.
For then the voice conserves its own formation,
Conserves its shape. But if the space between
Be longer than is fit, the words must be
Through the much air confounded, and the voice
Disordered in its flight across the winds—
And so it haps, that thou canst sound perceive,
Yet not determine what the words may mean;
To such degree confounded and encumbered
The voice approaches us. Again, one word,
Sent from the crier's mouth, may rouse all ears
Among the populace. And thus one voice
Scatters asunder into many voices,
Since it divides itself for separate ears,
Imprinting form of word and a clear tone.
But whatso part of voices fails to hit
The ears themselves perishes, borne beyond,
Idly diffused among the winds. A part,
Beating on solid porticoes, tossed back
Returns a sound; and sometimes mocks the ear
With a mere phantom of a word. When this
Thou well hast noted, thou canst render count
Unto thyself and others why it is
Along the lonely places that the rocks
Give back like shapes of words in order like,
When search we after comrades wandering
Among the shady mountains, and aloud
Call unto them, the scattered. I have seen
Spots that gave back even voices six or seven
For one thrown forth—for so the very hills,
Dashing them back against the hills, kept on
With their reverberations. And these spots
The neighbouring country-side doth feign to be
Haunts of the goat-foot satyrs and the nymphs;
And tells ye there be fauns, by whose night noise
And antic revels yonder they declare
The voiceless silences are broken oft,
And tones of strings are made and wailings sweet
Which the pipe, beat by players' finger-tips,
Pours out; and far and wide the farmer-race
Begins to hear, when, shaking the garmentings
Of pine upon his half-beast head, god-Pan
With puckered lip oft runneth o'er and o'er
The open reeds,—lest flute should cease to pour
The woodland music! Other prodigies
And wonders of this ilk they love to tell,
Lest they be thought to dwell in lonely spots
And even by gods deserted. This is why
They boast of marvels in their story-tellings;
Or by some other reason are led on—
Greedy, as all mankind hath ever been,
To prattle fables into ears.

       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp                            Again,
One need not wonder how it comes about
That through those places (through which eyes cannot
View objects manifest) sounds yet may pass
And assail the ears. For often we observe
People conversing, though the doors be closed;
No marvel either, since all voice unharmed
Can wind through bended apertures of things,
While idol-films decline to—for they're rent,
Unless along straight apertures they swim,
Like those in glass, through which all images
Do fly across. And yet this voice itself,
In passing through shut chambers of a house,
Is dulled, and in a jumble enters ears,
And sound we seem to hear far more than words.
Moreover, a voice is into all directions
Divided up, since off from one another
New voices are engendered, when one voice
Hath once leapt forth, outstarting into many—
As oft a spark of fire is wont to sprinkle
Itself into its several fires. And so,
Voices do fill those places hid behind,
Which all are in a hubbub round about,
Astir with sound. But idol-films do tend,
As once sent forth, in straight directions all;
Wherefore one can inside a wall see naught,
Yet catch the voices from beyond the same.

Nor tongue and palate, whereby we flavour feel,
Present more problems for more work of thought.
Firstly, we feel a flavour in the mouth,
When forth we squeeze it, in chewing up our food,—
As any one perchance begins to squeeze
With hand and dry a sponge with water soaked.
Next, all which forth we squeeze is spread about
Along the pores and intertwined paths
Of the loose-textured tongue. And so, when smooth
The bodies of the oozy flavour, then
Delightfully they touch, delightfully
They treat all spots, around the wet and trickling
Enclosures of the tongue. And contrariwise,
They sting and pain the sense with their assault,
According as with roughness they're supplied.
Next, only up to palate is the pleasure
Coming from flavour; for in truth when down
'Thas plunged along the throat, no pleasure is,
Whilst into all the frame it spreads around;
Nor aught it matters with what food is fed
The body, if only what thou take thou canst
Distribute well digested to the frame
And keep the stomach in a moist career.

Now, how it is we see some food for some,
Others for others....

I will unfold, or wherefore what to some
Is foul and bitter, yet the same to others
Can seem delectable to eat,—why here
So great the distance and the difference is
That what is food to one to some becomes
Fierce poison, as a certain snake there is
Which, touched by spittle of a man, will waste
And end itself by gnawing up its coil.
Again, fierce poison is the hellebore
To us, but puts the fat on goats and quails.
That thou mayst know by what devices this
Is brought about, in chief thou must recall
What we have said before, that seeds are kept
Commixed in things in divers modes. Again,
As all the breathing creatures which take food
Are outwardly unlike, and outer cut
And contour of their members bounds them round,
Each differing kind by kind, they thus consist
Of seeds of varying shape. And furthermore,
Since seeds do differ, divers too must be
The interstices and paths (which we do call
The apertures) in all the members, even
In mouth and palate too. Thus some must be
More small or yet more large, three-cornered some
And others squared, and many others round,
And certain of them many-angled too
In many modes. For, as the combination
And motion of their divers shapes demand,
The shapes of apertures must be diverse
And paths must vary according to their walls
That bound them. Hence when what is sweet to some,
Becomes to others bitter, for him to whom
'Tis sweet, the smoothest particles must needs
Have entered caressingly the palate's pores.
And, contrariwise, with those to whom that sweet
Is sour within the mouth, beyond a doubt
The rough and barbed particles have got
Into the narrows of the apertures.
Now easy it is from these affairs to know
Whatever...

Indeed, where one from o'er-abundant bile
Is stricken with fever, or in other wise
Feels the roused violence of some malady,
There the whole frame is now upset, and there
All the positions of the seeds are changed,—
So that the bodies which before were fit
To cause the savour, now are fit no more,
And now more apt are others which be able
To get within the pores and gender sour.
Both sorts, in sooth, are intermixed in honey—
What oft we've proved above to thee before.
Now come, and I will indicate what wise
Impact of odour on the nostrils touches.
And first, 'tis needful there be many things
From whence the streaming flow of varied odours
May roll along, and we're constrained to think
They stream and dart and sprinkle themselves about
Impartially. But for some breathing creatures
One odour is more apt, to others another—
Because of differing forms of seeds and pores.
Thus on and on along the zephyrs bees
Are led by odour of honey, vultures too
By carcasses. Again, the forward power
Of scent in dogs doth lead the hunter on
Whithersoever the splay-foot of wild beast
Hath hastened its career; and the white goose,
The saviour of the Roman citadel,
Forescents afar the odour of mankind.
Thus, diversly to divers ones is given
Peculiar smell that leadeth each along
To his own food or makes him start aback
From loathsome poison, and in this wise are
The generations of the wild preserved.

Yet is this pungence not alone in odours
Or in the class of flavours; but, likewise,
The look of things and hues agree not all
So well with senses unto all, but that
Some unto some will be, to gaze upon,
More keen and painful. Lo, the raving lions,
They dare not face and gaze upon the cock
Who's wont with wings to flap away the night
From off the stage, and call the beaming morn
With clarion voice—and lions straightway thus
Bethink themselves of flight, because, ye see,
Within the body of the cocks there be
Some certain seeds, which, into lions' eyes
Injected, bore into the pupils deep
And yield such piercing pain they can't hold out
Against the cocks, however fierce they be—
Whilst yet these seeds can't hurt our gaze the least,
Either because they do not penetrate,
Or since they have free exit from the eyes
As soon as penetrating, so that thus
They cannot hurt our eyes in any part
By there remaining.

       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp                  To speak once more of odour;
Whatever assail the nostrils, some can travel
A longer way than others. None of them,
However, 's borne so far as sound or voice—
While I omit all mention of such things
As hit the eyesight and assail the vision.
For slowly on a wandering course it comes
And perishes sooner, by degrees absorbed
Easily into all the winds of air;—
And first, because from deep inside the thing
It is discharged with labour (for the fact
That every object, when 'tis shivered, ground,
Or crumbled by the fire, will smell the stronger
Is sign that odours flow and part away
From inner regions of the things). And next,
Thou mayest see that odour is create
Of larger primal germs than voice, because
It enters not through stony walls, wherethrough
Unfailingly the voice and sound are borne;
Wherefore, besides, thou wilt observe 'tis not
So easy to trace out in whatso place
The smelling object is. For, dallying on
Along the winds, the particles cool off,
And then the scurrying messengers of things
Arrive our senses, when no longer hot.
So dogs oft wander astray, and hunt the scent.

Now mark, and hear what objects move the mind,
And learn, in few, whence unto intellect
Do come what come. And first I tell thee this:
That many images of objects rove
In many modes to every region round—
So thin that easily the one with other,
When once they meet, uniteth in mid-air,
Like gossamer or gold-leaf. For, indeed,
Far thinner are they in their fabric than
Those images which take a hold on eyes
And smite the vision, since through body's pores
They penetrate, and inwardly stir up
The subtle nature of mind and smite the sense.
Thus, Centaurs and the limbs of Scyllas, thus
The Cerberus-visages of dogs we see,
And images of people gone before—
Dead men whose bones earth bosomed long ago;
Because the images of every kind
Are everywhere about us borne—in part
Those which are gendered in the very air
Of own accord, in part those others which
From divers things do part away, and those
Which are compounded, made from out their shapes.
For soothly from no living Centaur is
That phantom gendered, since no breed of beast
Like him was ever; but, when images
Of horse and man by chance have come together,
They easily cohere, as aforesaid,
At once, through subtle nature and fabric thin.
In the same fashion others of this ilk
Created are. And when they're quickly borne
In their exceeding lightness, easily
(As earlier I showed) one subtle image,
Compounded, moves by its one blow the mind,
Itself so subtle and so strangely quick.

That these things come to pass as I record,
From this thou easily canst understand:
So far as one is unto other like,
Seeing with mind as well as with the eyes
Must come to pass in fashion not unlike.
Well, now, since I have shown that I perceive
Haply a lion through those idol-films
Such as assail my eyes, 'tis thine to know
Also the mind is in like manner moved,
And sees, nor more nor less than eyes do see
(Except that it perceives more subtle films)
The lion and aught else through idol-films.
And when the sleep has overset our frame,
The mind's intelligence is now awake,
Still for no other reason, save that these—
The self-same films as when we are awake—
Assail our minds, to such degree indeed
That we do seem to see for sure the man
Whom, void of life, now death and earth have gained
Dominion over. And nature forces this
To come to pass because the body's senses
Are resting, thwarted through the members all,
Unable now to conquer false with true;
And memory lies prone and languishes
In slumber, nor protests that he, the man
Whom the mind feigns to see alive, long since
Hath been the gain of death and dissolution.

And further, 'tis no marvel idols move
And toss their arms and other members round
In rhythmic time—and often in men's sleeps
It haps an image this is seen to do;
In sooth, when perishes the former image,
And other is gendered of another pose,
That former seemeth to have changed its gestures.
Of course the change must be conceived as speedy;
So great the swiftness and so great the store
Of idol-things, and (in an instant brief
As mind can mark) so great, again, the store
Of separate idol-parts to bring supplies.

It happens also that there is supplied
Sometimes an image not of kind the same;
But what before was woman, now at hand
Is seen to stand there, altered into male;
Or other visage, other age succeeds;
But slumber and oblivion take care
That we shall feel no wonder at the thing.

And much in these affairs demands inquiry,
And much, illumination—if we crave
With plainness to exhibit facts. And first,
Why doth the mind of one to whom the whim
To think has come behold forthwith that thing?
Or do the idols watch upon our will,
And doth an image unto us occur,
Directly we desire—if heart prefer
The sea, the land, or after all the sky?
Assemblies of the citizens, parades,
Banquets, and battles, these and all doth she,
Nature, create and furnish at our word?—
Maugre the fact that in same place and spot
Another's mind is meditating things
All far unlike. And what, again, of this:
When we in sleep behold the idols step,
In measure, forward, moving supple limbs,
Whilst forth they put each supple arm in turn
With speedy motion, and with eyeing heads
Repeat the movement, as the foot keeps time?
Forsooth, the idols they are steeped in art,
And wander to and fro well taught indeed,—
Thus to be able in the time of night
To make such games! Or will the truth be this:
Because in one least moment that we mark—
That is, the uttering of a single sound—
There lurk yet many moments, which the reason
Discovers to exist, therefore it comes
That, in a moment how so brief ye will,
The divers idols are hard by, and ready
Each in its place diverse? So great the swiftness,
So great, again, the store of idol-things,
And so, when perishes the former image,
And other is gendered of another pose,
The former seemeth to have changed its gestures.
And since they be so tenuous, mind can mark
Sharply alone the ones it strains to see;
And thus the rest do perish one and all,
Save those for which the mind prepares itself.
Further, it doth prepare itself indeed,
And hopes to see what follows after each—
Hence this result. For hast thou not observed
How eyes, essaying to perceive the fine,
Will strain in preparation, otherwise
Unable sharply to perceive at all?
Yet know thou canst that, even in objects plain,
If thou attendest not, 'tis just the same
As if 'twere all the time removed and far.
What marvel, then, that mind doth lose the rest,
Save those to which 'thas given up itself?
So 'tis that we conjecture from small signs
Things wide and weighty, and involve ourselves
In snarls of self-deceit."

But look, um, you're being kinda stingy on the scoopage
I asked for double meat, and man I know you're not a new kid
So why you tryna screw me out of food, you think I'm stupid?

It seems like everybody else that ordered food is grinnin'

But there's no fucking answer, and the doors: they're bolted shut
I try and get an employee and she's like ""yo whats up""
I said ""I gotta get inside, I feel like throwin' up""
Well I'm prairie doggin' everything
I'm dancing by myself like Billy Idol tryna hold it in
Finally, I'm in, I'm sprayin' like an automatic
Ratta-tat-tat, and then all the puke and shit scattered

A shrine amidst
The rotting
In a whirl of wind-swept leaves
I watch the waves unfurl
Before the glittering expanse
& in the absence of
Your self-mirroring
Otherness
I replace
Your love
With chemicals"
2603,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like nobody cares
When I'm sitting alone on the hallway stairs
I need a friend, a love, a life to fit in
But I am to weak to get out of my skin

[Pre Chorus]
I was down on my knees and I never felt release from the pain that is hiding so deep inside
I have fought my heart, so full of delusion. But now I see it clearly right in front of my eyes

[Chorus]
Woohooho, you're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are standing strong
Woohooho, we're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us
Tonight we learn to live again and we never let you down

[Verse 2]
I will never back down, now it's my time to sin
I'll make you eat the dirt that you put me in
I was a coward to not stand up for myself. I got a beaten in the face first when I was twelve
[Pre Chorus]
And now I have more than I ever had before 'cause I Just stand up and I make it mine
The fear of always being rejected turned out to be just a ghost in my head

[Chorus]
Woohooho, you're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are standing strong
Woohooho, we're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us. Tonight we learn to live again and we never let you down

[Verse 3]
I'm not a fucking misfit in your perfect world
I just wanna break out as long as I can. I wanna break out
You never let me in. I'll never back down on the way to myself
Never back down. Just let met go. I wanna be part of the fun
I got 99 talents but you ain't see one. I need a chance to show you what I've got
I just wanna be me cause I'll die if I'm not

[Chorus]
Woohooho, you're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are standing strong
Woohooho, we're not alone. Kill your idols! Together we are strong

Tonight we're breaking down these walls
Though you never believed us. Tonight we learn to live again and we never let you down"

My heart was completely caught
Little by little I was enthralled
I’m still numb
Stuck on your throat, ahem
What you couldn’t swallow?
Think about it carefully

The reason I also did not know
The reason not even you knew
We eventually broke up
Tell me something

In the end, I was not enough for you
I am a child
I will tell you something

Then what were you supposed to be good for?
Go away baby
It’s ok, leave, leave first
I will catch up with you
I will catch up with you
I will catch up with you

A beautiful farewell
In order to avoid the pain
My hearts feels sorry
Let’s end it now

I can’t believe it
What is it that you could not hear properly?
Think about it carefully

The reason I also did not know
The reason not even you knew

Tell me something

In the end, I was not enough for you

I did not realize I was getting better
Thank you, you were nothing

It’s such a pity
Now you are pitiful
I hold back my tears
I don’t have anymore left

I don’t have I don’t have I don’t have I don’t have

Welcome everybody
To the Reefer Madness mixtape
And uh...
We bout to get into this thang...
A lil something like this

(Verse)

Been a long time but the game's still mine
Still been hustling on my grind
Still been working on my music
Just gave my crew the deuces

Gathered up my game and used it
Got the fuck away from the useless
Niggas that don't think no bigger
Nigga's still Grym [grim] but my buzz much bigger
Figured I was gonna fall off
But why?
Would I come down
Cause a nigga too fly
Can't make it rain cause you niggas too dry
Don't fit the bill no need to apply
There's no love lost between you and I
Cause I'm destined to shine like a beam in the sky
Been on the rise
Ever since I arrived
King in disguise
It's me
Who am I?"

Breathing the plastic air but you weren't there to calm, calm my nerves
For the first time didn't even care

All, all while tripping
While tripping on my toe tag
Choking on my consciousness 'cause now I know I've died the most

While tripping on my toe tag
Confusion came to check my pulse 'cause now they know I've died the most

Woke up
See bags of blood they're all my type
Breathe in the putrid smell of my own skin
It rots off my bones
Looking at the others rotting too
I got up touched the ground felt the cold concrete below my feet

Look at the sun move, flow like honey
Shinin' on soft, golden girl lyin' close to the ocean
Face you might see smilin' from your TV
With green eyes softly closed I suppose she is dreamin' of someone
Her smile fades as a cloud shades the sun
When she opens her eyes I can see that it's time to go ho-oh-ome

Ho-whoa-ome
Ho-whoa-ome

Didn't go far when I realized feelings are changin'
She climbs in the van and composеs her tempest
Looks at thе man who has changed in her eyes since the mornin'

She'll be miles away when we finally arrive at her ho-oh-ome

The things I never told

To get on by

'Cause I can change I'm not the same
Not forever
What can I say? I'm not okay
I wish I was
I want you back I want a time
I can remember
It's as simple as I say
I can change I'm not the same
Not forever

So I got out at nights
Take walks down easy street
So talkative
No matter who I see
I wake up shaking
Not alone but on my own
I need some other guide
To help
Me get back home
'Cause I can change I'm not the same
Not forever
What can I say? I'm not okay
I wish I was
I want you back I want a time
I can remember
It's as simple as I say
I can change I'm not the same

You want this part of me
The song lines in your mind
That's who I'm trying to be
And that's what you will find
If you just let me in, take me back
Closer than we ever were
I promise it's for real

'Cause I can change I'm not the same
Not forever
What can I say? I'm not okay
I wish I was
I want you back I want a time
I can remember
It's as simple as I say
I can change I'm not the same
Yeah, I have changed I'm not the same
Not forever

Sometimes the best you can do is just survive

We are feeding flies (With pieces of ambition)
Prison skin
Keeps us safety pinned (I'll whisper your incision)
Hostile strum and icepick tongue
Shelter here from everyone

Word of mouth shit went south
Picked up, packed up, left the house
That's right, you pansy
Seen you cookin' like Gordon Ramsay
That's when shit got heavy
Did the Bebop cause you couldn't Rocksteady
Couldn't make it right like Mike Holmes
Destroyed the house like a cyclone
That's when I picked up the microphone
Said watch throws it just like a bone
Like to know what happened, eh?
Guess we became perfect strangers
New York Rangers against the Leafs
On TV had front row seats
Jersey's on with a couple of treats
She was in the streets with a couple of skeets
Cause all you ever did was lurk nights
Never helped me fix my dark life
When this shit wouldn't work right
You took a toll on me
You turned white
I fixed this shit myself
And all I want to do is burn mics
Watched Jumanji, hopped in the hondy
Picked up Ronnie down on Boncloddy
That's the night I looked at the moon
And thought to myself it would be over soon
Yeah, uh, I always knew you were nothing
But this shit here took a lot of guts
Not a single tear fell from my eye
And to this day, really not sure why

If there's one thing I knows for certain
Everything I was to you was a burden
Up against the wall, red ass
Only place I ever came, dead last
Remember when we went to Kmart?
You stole a bunch of shit and told me to stay sharp
What in the fuck'd you think?
I couldn't use a device in the rink?
Suppose you're preoccupied
Every time you talk you lie
The truth hurts, break out the perks
No candy-coat, just get dessert
Nan? What's taking dad?
He never came home now I'm breaking bad
I used to sweep it under the rug
But I'm putting the broom down
And I'm calling god
It was all love when I got rich
But I never got rich
So you don't love shit
So better get your steadicam
'Cause they're rockin' this shit like Eddie Van

Won't forget the day that you walked away
I was left to stay, da-da-da-da

Remember when time was all we had?
No care for the sand in the hourglass
Each new night was another shot
To stake our claim on a parking lot

Remember when friends we're all we'd need?
Day followed the night and we'd let it lead
In the basement, on the pavement
We couldn't conceive of an end to it
But it's not like that anymore

[Chorus]
Re-group, re-calculate
Rushing in was our first mistake
Re-think, re-calibrate
Set our sights on something bigger
(maybe move on to better things)

Remember the pain of growing up?
It may have hurt but it sure was fun
It made us who we are now
It gave us a mystery to figure out
This is what we waited for

These days not much has changed
Except how we feel and whats at stake
But we are still the same
Should we chose to linger
Or move on to better things"

Let’s bring it up to date
Have you heard about the new slavemaster bill?
I ain’t talking about Clinton
They got a bill before Congress now called Three Strikes, You’re Out
I heard Reverend Jackson say that they should invest four thousand dollars in a college education
Instead of forty thousand dollars a year for incarceration
But what the Reverend Jackson doesn’t understand is
They would rather sell—pardon me, they would rather circulate forty thousand dollars in the economy through a prison system than only four thousand dollars a year in an education system
Because they create for their people more jobs with forty thousand dollars a year than they could ever create with four thousand dollars a year
And besides that, if you graduate the Black man and the Black woman with a college degree, then they become competitive in the economic market for jobs
Isn’t that right? *applause* Let’s look at it now
How many Black men are locked up in prison today?
They say it’s, uh, more than one million
Well now, if the economy generates forty thousand dollars for every inmate and you got one million inmates, how much is that?
That’s forty billion dollars a year
But now some of them are saying something’s wrong with prison, it’s like a revolving door
You let ‘em in the front end and you let ‘em out the back end
And the way they look at this thing, you’re letting my money out the back door
When you put ‘em in, don’t ever let ‘em out
So now, that’s where Three Strikes, You’re Out is coming from
Because it means that if a young Black man gets to the third strike, say, at age 25
And his life expectancy is to the age 65, meaning he’s going to spend 40 years behind bars
At forty thousand dollars a year, which equals 1.6 million dollars that he is worth to the economy of the United States
If you let that same Black man out in the present economy, he’s only going to earn a median income of 21 thousand dollars
So if he’s a free Black man, he earns 20 thousand a year, which is 800 thousand dollars in his lifetime
But if he’s locked down in a penitentiary, it’s twice as much
So where’s the economic incentive?
The economic incentive is to lock you up, brother
You’re worth more to them locked up than you are as a free man"

Breathe

Wish that life would just figure it out for me
Cause I'm reachin' out my hand now
Wish that I could just find me some sympathy

Try my best not to knock them down
Everybody wants it
To be somebody in this big town
But I'm tired

It's all cool
What am I doing instead

Inconceivable
I am dutiful
But unbeautiful

Like the president
Or mini-series queen
You are happening
But what does it mean

Unbeautiful
We’re not thoughtless; we’re not cruel
We’re just unbeautiful

The air’s three shades of brown
We breathe we suck it down
Now it is a part of us
Don’t know when this began
I talk therefore I am
Someone tell me who to trust
All the hands that
I’ve been shaking
I would prefer
To be breaking

You are lying
For a living
You’re ignoring
Your misgivings"
7609,"Tragedy befell Louise of Littleville
Her lover died of suicide
And yet she carried on
As brave as any mouse could be
The suitors came from far and wide
And each declared a blazing love that would abide
But sweet Louise, she cried and asserted stubbornly
I will not wear a buttercup for you
I will not dine on wine and cheese with you
I will not share my life
With any other love
He worked his tiny hands unto the bone
He died despairing, wretched, and alone
I will not rouse my heart till we reunite above
Poor Louise's family
They shook their headed and pleaded ceaselessly
Oh daughter, there is so much more to see
In this fascinating world
Your nest is derelict and disarrayed
Alone you sit in darkness every day
It breaks our hearts to see your sadness, silly girl
You didn't care when he was still alive
You didn't care to help us grow and thrive
You didn't care, you calmly left it up to fate
We worked our weary hands unto the bone
We tried, he broke, he died, I'm left alone
You didn't care and now it simply is too late
Oh, my love, I'm sorry, sorry
Oh, my love, come save me, save me
Oh, my love, forgive my weakness
Oh, my god, it's hopeless, hopeless"

7828,"Sometimes, when I wonder what I’m like, underneath,
I think of my first two weeks, I was drenched
with happiness. The wall opened
like liquid, my head slid through, my legs, I
pushed off, from the side, soared
gently, turned, squeezed out
neatly into the cold illuminated
air and breathed it. Washed off, wrapped,
I slept, and when I woke there was the breast
the size of my head, hard and full,
the springy drupelets of the nipple. Sleep.
Milk. Heat. Every day
she held me up to the window and wagged
my fist at my sister, down in the street, who
waved her cone back at me so
hard the ice cream flew through the air like a
butter-brickle cannonball,
otherwise it was sleep and milk,
by day my mother’s, by night the nurses
would prop me with the bottle. Paradise
had its laws – every four hours and not
a minute sooner I could drink, but every four
hours I could have the world in my mouth.
Two weeks, and then home, to the end of the hall,
where at night a nurse would give me four ounces of
water every four hours, and in the meantime I shrieked for it.
They knew it would build my character,
to learn to give up, and I learned it – dawn
and the satiny breast, the burp, the boiled
sheet to be placed on where my sister couldn’t touch me,
I lay and moved my arms and legs like
feelers in the light. Glorious life!
And it would always be there, behind those nights
of tap water, the whole way back,
that fortnight of unlimited ration,
every four hours – clock of cream
and flame, I have known heaven."

Met her at the B school
So let me see some assets
All I needs an address, I'll put that in my map quest
But better hurry, I got a 9:30 math test
And that night, we had mad sex
Went raw, I think I went mad sex
After that, I kinda felt bad sex
The last text I sent said me and her friend had sex
We got history

Take another shot, I bet it'll erase all the misery
And the pain
I know your hurting baby girl, cause me I feel the same

I still let it go cause I can't help but wonder why

One summer night, lost myself while performing
I can't even recall what I let go for
Same reason now why I can't stay sober

2197,"From the vaults below the deserttemple
To the throne among the stars
In the hearts of us, your children, oh divine luminary
Thou shineth!
Like sunbeams penetrating the foundations of the earth
Thine grace ignites the seeds of creation
And in our veins is stillness, as your shadows come to life
For they are like whispers speaking of
...death in heaven

Behold the black cloud of corpselike birds
Their wings are on fire
And their song has turned backwards
A morbid cacaphony singing of...
A new dawn!

Burn my flesh, thou light of lights
Most eminent perfection, most magnificent of sights
Mark me with thee, stainless Ar
Most real, so clear and bright they shine both eye and star
Descend upon the dead, black sky
By a grace of just one glance they all shall die
Pour the bitter wine of salvation into our blood
And let our scars form rivers flooding the kingdom of their god
Let the immense gates of heaven open
Let the dawn of justice come
When a thousand pale and silenced faces
Turn towards the sky
To behold in fear and wonder how the firmanent turns dark
By the sound of a lonely trumpet calling
And countless birdlike carrions falls reeking from above
Embedded in a red glow telling of...
A burning dawn!

For this sunrise shall not wake you by the foul light of Christ
But by Satan's fire burning in your eyes
And the thundering voice of a lion over the plains of man
Shall proclaim the horned phoenix final rise
For it is not rain that falls tonight from the black, ominious sky
But sulphur tears from the last flock of birds
And the wind carries the smell of death, from the agony in their hearts

6606,"The boy wore coke bottle glasses
The boy could stand to lose a few pounds
Everyday we found some way to bring the poor boy down
Find one flaw, one tiny flaw and let the vultures go to town

Bring him down
It brings me up, it brings me up to bring him down

Hey you ugly tub o' lard
Did ya get those clothes at K-mart?
Ass-head, you should be thin
Your the last kid picked, you'll never win

Bring him down (3x)
It brings me up, it brings me up to bring him down
Whose cool whose not, who am I to decide?
I went home to watch TV, Tremaine went home to dry his eyes

Now I see the error of my ways
I left that attitude in fifth grade
But I got a question, can you answer me?
You're all grown up, why do you act the same?"

See it go slowly
Mystical clouds are a smoking gun
And it all makes sense
This is life
Venus in the cold night
Waiting for the night to end
This could take all day
The sun is getting high now
Pondering the storm clouds
Of a demon night
A track to leave behind
Of a demon night
When love is so kind you would fill me up
And we could finally see our way
When fate is so blinding that it hurts
And we could finally see our way
I'm staring at a crowd watching eyes my friend
Goes back to starlight
And I'm bleeding words over and over in my head
He was my friend
He was my friend
He was my friend
He was my friend
To Life
Two Lives
I think to the light of day
Of a demon night
A track to leave behind
Of a demon night
When love is so kind you would fill me up
And we could finally see our way
When fate is so blinding that it hurts
And we could finally see our way
And there is a lesson you will learn
Or you could find it out the hard way
And there is a lesson you will learn
And we could finally see our way
Finally see our way
Finally see our way
When love is so kind you would fill me up
And we could finally see our way
When fate is so blinding that it hurts

And there is a lesson you will learn
Or you could find it out the hard way
Yeah there is a lesson you will learn

7794,"[Verse 1]
Side by side we sit on the floor
Passing notes under the glass door
That divides us but we choose to ignore
I've a new face to read, a new mind to explore
No distance away but still too far
Right next to me but a world apart
Tied with beads, bone and string
Bound to fail before we begin

[Chorus]
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can’t promise that I'll lie there too
The sun is high, our skies are blue
At the end of the day is there room for two?
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can't promise that I’ll lie there too
We run together, our spirits free
At the end of the day is there room for me?

[Verse 2]
I lean in, still shoulder to shoulder
Against the glass we just get colder
Electricity in your finger tips
But lights go out when the switch drips
The battle rages in my chest
Maybe this is for the best
The more I breathe, the more you are blurred
In my dreams your screams that'll never be heard
[Chorus]
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can't promise that I'll lie there too
The sun is high, our skies are blue
At the end of the day is there room for two?
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can't promise that I'll lie there too
We run together, our spirits free
At the end of the day is there room for me?

You made your bed, now lie in it
You made your bed, now lie in it
You made your bed, now lie in it
You made your bed, now lie in it
You made your bed, now lie in it
You made your bed, now lie in it

[Chorus]
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can't promise that I'll lie there too
The sun is high, our skies are blue
At the end of the day is there room for two?
Lie in the bed that you made for you
I can’t promise that I’ll lie there too
We run together, our spirits free
At the end of the day is there room for me?

No wonder she has no friends at all

Beauty strong enough to trick me
Quick clouds a storm so moody

Everyone is addicted to something
Nowadays all of us want a buzz, me too I ain't fronting
Want to buzz off my music, feed my family from it

It doesn’t matter what’s your status
Even the rich can’t break the habit
Alice in wonderland follow the white rabbit
It’s a fantasy, can you see me chasing the dragon?
I ain’t bragging, a whole generation on a bandwagon
Groupies for a euphoria, fanatics
Shit could make your hair stand, mad static
You want skeletons in your attic you can have at it

Just living the dream
Got joints of OG, please give it to me so I could
Smoke one by myself on the way homе
For all the nights I didn’t have no place to go
No placе to go

Yeah I'm stoned, like I just looked at medusa
The chorus had you hooked like a user to the music
The same thing happened to me
All it took was one Eminem song to make me rap on a beat
And that’s before I had braces with a gap in my teeth
Flapping my gums, trigger finger like I’m clapping a gun
Slim Shady LP and some Capital Punishment
Can’t describe how much that shit meant to me
I was a fiend, I knew that my day was coming
It wasn’t about no pipe dream
Wasn’t about making money
At the time I didn’t care
Just saw the game and wanted to fit in over there
I said standing in the mirror
Looking back at myself, so eager
Even thought of asking other rappers for help
Would have to pay them for a feature
Even capture the moment on a camera to show that we matched up
Fuck that, lab in the pad I’m a bachelor
Pan in the sink, fried egg on the spatula
Eat it real quick then it’s right back to the
Dragon I’ve been chasing, I swear I’m an addict, shit cracks me up
Maniacal laughter
Pacing around the microphone, psycho babbler
Hard to explain myself despite my vocabulary
Have a conversation with me I’ll start rambling
Fuck around, overdose on sampling
I hope there is an aux cord in the ambulance
In a strange way I understand Eminem
I’m not one of his Stans though, But then again
If I don’t finish this track I’ll start trembling
Get a midnight snack like a gremlin
A hop skip and a jump right back, keep assembling
Shit is endless if they question this tell them
Just living the dream
Got joints of OG, please give it to me so I could
Smoke one by myself on the way home
For all the nights I didn’t have no place to go
No place to go
Just living the dream
Got joints of OG, please give it to me so I could
Smoke one by myself on the way home

Brown skin 6'4"" entrepreneur
On a six month tour, bonjour for sure
I kick down doors, dick down hoes
The P.O. giving you more than what'chu bargained for
My diamonds shine and they glisten, they glisten n they shine
Them bottom boys coming through with a raw ass rhyme
For soul and Barcelon' the biggest dome in Rome

Rather drive my impala, smoke and pop bottles

For once shit, we can eat a meal together
Squash the rumors I'm on the dock wit Cubans

Had the coupe four months still missin the top
Before we leave the beach she ride dick in the drop
We pop pills in the club sip Cris on the rocks
Ya'll on the dance floor throwin bow's like Ludacris
I'm at the bar blowin loot on Cris
Respect the hot boys but we cool in the game
Put a tool in ya frame, I'm at the Eben Rock in the pool with a dame
Ask who stack the change Carol City cartel came to crack the game

3717,"I hate you
When I see you on the street
Acting hard, thinking on your feet
Treating me like some piece of meat

I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me too

I love you
But nothing I can say will change
If you admit you feel the same
Did you just ask me why I'm acting strange

I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me too"
8075,"Are you all settled in? Right, then we can begin. My name is...
ALFIE!

Once there was a time
When my mind lay on higher things
And once there was a time
I could find pretty words to sing
But now, well now I find
It saves time to say what you mean
I know it seems so unrefined
But it's time to let off some steam

Oh come on!
Everybody knows that No means Yes
Just like glasses come free on the N.H.S
But the more I look through them the more I see
I'm becoming more like Alfie

Once there was a time
When a kind word could be enough
And once there was a time
I could blindfold myself with love
But not now—now I'm resigned
To the kind of life I had reserved
For other guys less smart than I
Oh you know—the kind who will always end up with the girls
And besides
Everybody knows that No means Yes
Just like glasses come free on the N.H.S
But the more I look through them the more I see
I'm becoming more like Alfie

Oh come on!"
1230,"Life was full of love, and we're not often wrong, but she saw it coming from a mile off
They won't say a word but what they think I want, so I saw it blowing up like it does
And you went too far, and it takes too long, and you wait too long, but you find, we just might keep ourselves alive this time
Now who can you trust?
We've all been working hard but finally it fell apart and came undone
It's just criminal to see how the tragic stuff always seems to come to the best of us"
3228,"[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold
Like a vow that is tested
Like a covenant of old
And Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain
And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today

Faithful You have been
And faithful You will be
You pledge Yourself to me

You Father the orphan
Your kindness makes us whole
And You shoulder our weakness
And Your strength becomes our own
You're making me like You
Clothing me in white
Bringing beauty from ashes
For You will have Your bride

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Free of all her guilt
And rid of all her shame
And known by her true name
And it’s why I sing

[Chorus]
Your praise will, ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

How long will it take if I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the blue line
Take a bus from the station and I'll meet you out there
Get a drink if that's alright

Don't care what we do 'cause the night is ours
As long as we do what we're doing for hours
How long will it take if I got time for a shower?
You could jump on the blue line

Keeping me away, keep me away from you
Keep me away from you

It's cold outside, I've been waiting for an hour
But it's feeling like forever
I put my best dress on with a low-cut top
Guess I should've worn a sweater
And every passing car leaves me wondering
Did you read me wrong? What's happening?
Did the driver say “Go the other way.”
“And look for something better.”?

I hope that the traffic lights don't, don't
Keeping me away from you
I hope that the traffic lights don't change

2684,"I sat down and I tried to do some thinking
Found my thoughts just a little bit to frank
Got up and I went to do some cleaning
Hit my head on a leather sherman's tank

The turret is swelled and in position
It points toward a never charging flank of
Adamant but unreasonable people
Forever pulling rank and they say

Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in

You know the odds are against you
Of you ever getting needing
But you can't help calling the RSP - P

Where is my box of pretty pictures
When I get to look at them I smile
They capture the many celebrations of
Victories I haven't had in a long while
Like the day that I turned from the edge of the cliffs
Secret methods by which I drain out all my bile
Can't forget the one that makes me proudest
When I finally finished the four hundred many mile, but

Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in

You know you should really be quiet
Cause they might not ever forgive you
But who knows they might have ESP

So back in my strategical location
I decided to give myself a break
After all I know I'm getting colder
How much guilt can a hopeless person take

Some birds fly low in my direction
I reach up to give their wings a shake
Seems like congratulations are in order
With every flap they make, and they say

Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in

And your state of exhaustion
Might be your greater glory
If it helps you learn to sit still and behave
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in
Who cares what you've been, where you're going, or how you're getting in"

Holla at hood rats, hustle in the trap, but we know that all gets real old
It Gets real colds, when u all alone
Do me a favor let me die slow
Don’t have no sympathy for what it could of been
You were just my always girl
You was never my friend
That was that high school and college shit
This is the end
This is the end
No it is not for pretend

Its time for a change, no obama
Don’t want no girl like my momma
I wanna live single like Khadijah

Magnificent she part of the mac team
Face on fleek

Attitude on Rasheed Wallace
After the blazers got beat

Let you touch my heart
You was the only one
Mutombo with the block
Had to hold up one
When you block the ex
That means she other won one
Now I say congrats to u

The pussy was good
You was wet like a flood
Couldn’t trust you girl you was dirty as mud

Only speak in a different language and
How am I supposed to manage it?
But not feel inadequate?
It's almost like I want to write a letter oh
Crease it with a better fold
Stuff it in an envelope
But I can't cause my metaphorical pen is broke
This the type of thing I think about when I'm left alone
Everybody think they know a better road
Everybody think they have an antidote
But they don't see the
Writing on the walls of my cerebral
That has already been set in stone
Lost in thought but I'm not trying to find my way out of it
People telling me like ""Give it some time and you won't be so passionate""
Instead I open the medicine cabinet
Cause I'm sick of the people thinking they know me better than I know myself
I'm standing at the top of this hill, I don't see no one else
Sometimes I lay in the basement to find the space that I need
Funny how I gotta go down, down just to feel like I reached my peak
[Hook]
Breaking bread, hearts and barriers we
Breaking both of my legs with enough luck to carry us see
Breaking records like I'm smashing vinyls
That is final
Flip the switch like its a type of light bulb and
Believe
Imma tell em
Believe we on
Believe we on

[Verse 2]
I'll be running in place
Trying to jog my memory
But not what you meant to me
Never forgot that
Push it far back
Make sure I'm focused mentally
Just as I'm listening to mind blowing melodies
Mind blowing as John F. Kennedy
In his limousine
In 1970
Minus seven we
Tell the president to rest in peace
Setting precedence in the present tense as I press a dent
Into the side of my water bottle
As I lie on my side in the cold of autumn
And I spy in the sky one big load of awful
Scary clouds but decide it won't pose a problem
I embrace it
I'm embracing the rain that
Drown out the noise in the background
And with that sound could've wrote a novel
Full of bad advice that I know was hostile
Say I push people out but I know I gotta
Cuz when I build my tower so callosal
They all climb to the top, watch it slowly topple
Watch it slowly topple
Watch it slowly topple
Watch it slowly topple, yeah
Cause I wanna be in control
Of the birth of my ideas
I am whatever I Plan to B
Brainchild wakes up to see us
I know
Yeah I know
[Hook]
Breaking bread, hearts and barriers we
Breaking both of my legs with enough luck to carry us see
Breaking records like I'm smashing vinyls

One of a kind
One of a kind
All in my mind
All in my mind
Thought bubble
On top of my head
Caught in a flock
And oppressed
I'm gonna just
Pause and then
Stop and then rest
I need some space to breathe
But in space you cannot breathe
I do not know what I need
Believe we on
We on

2984,"Born in a factory working town
The cobbled streets were his playground
A worn out ball his favourite toy
Just like all the other boys

At nine his head was full of dreams
Of superstars on movie screens
At fifteen he stole his first car
I guess he won't be going far

A wedding day at seventeen
Shotgun; with a beauty queen
A broken home at twenty-one
He couldn't stay, he had to run

At twenty-four he killed a man
On a drunken joyride into town
Riding 'round with his old friends
Trying to find his youth again

His dreams were shattered here
On the tar-black roads of yesteryear
Dreams will be broken down
And as they die they make no sound
At thirty-five he's out of jail
Out of luck; the system's failed
Unskilled and unneeded now
He drifts around from town to town

He tries to heal the wounds he feels
With the bottle and the devil's deals
Something sweet to numb the pain
To find his boyhood dreams again

His dreams that were shattered here
On the tar-black roads of yesteryear
Dreams will be broken down
And as they die they make no sound

As time creeps on the aching starts
For the scattered trail of broken hearts
For the lives he's lost and left behind
For the people gone, and the tears he's cried
For the wasted opportunities
For the better man he might have been
For the paths he never chose to take
And the choices that can't be unmade

And one day he sees a younger man
On the silver screen from a distant land
A light familiar in his eyes
The trace of a long lost lover's smile
A boy he never saw grow up
A boy who dreamed and followed up
A boy who grew to be a man
Who shaped his life with his own hands
But his dreams were shattered here
On the tar-black roads of yesteryear
Dreams that were broken down
And as they died they made no sound

And maybe when he sees the end
He'll wish he could go back again
See that boy; nine years old
Playing carefree in the road

Maybe he will tell him lies
Tell him it will be all right
Maybe he'll just say it plain
You'll want to live your life again"

Now I'm divin' in my consciousness
See what's under my, skin
There's a reason for my restlessness
I feel the outsides turnin' in

[Chorus]
And now I'm breathin' in, again
A silent touch and deep, within
Searchin', we went and searchin', we went and searchin', we went again
Searchin', we went and searchin', we went and searchin', we went again

And now I'm divin' in my consciousness
I am slowly, loosing control
All my patterns, have disappeared
And I am fallin' into this deep black hole

And now I'm breathin' in, again
A silent touch and deep, within
Because the answers inside were tall[?] yeah
Searchin', we went and searchin', we went and searchin', we went again

All my life I've been debating
All the crows, they sit there waiting
Wondering what I'm going to eat
Until I have it
I can't sleep

I finally see you on the floor
Your heart's not beating anymore
My lust for you just cannot wait
Your skin, it tastes like chocolate

Staring blankly at the sun
Waiting for my time to come
Your happy life, it makes me sick
All the screaming sounds like music

Lucid are my pooling dreams
Someone tell me what they mean
There's an iron smell of blood in the air
But I can't find it anywhere
[Chorus]
I've been waiting for someone
To find me and become a part of me
(Become part of me)

I've been waiting for you to come here
And kill me and set me free (set me free)
I've been waiting for

[Verse 2]
Blood's flavor is so metallic
It's smell makes me go fanatic
Texture that I find in you is as thick as viscous glue

My senses have become so keen
With all I touch and all I see
There's an iron smell of blood in the air
And now I see it everywhere

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for someone
To find me and become a part of me
(Become part of me)

I've been waiting for you to come here
And kill me and set me free
I've been waiting for the one

The one
I've been waiting for someone
I've been waiting for you to come here and kill me
And set me free

I've been waiting for someone
To find me and become a part of me

I've been waiting for you to come here
And kill me and set me free
I've been waiting for the one

I've been waiting for you to come here
And kill me (and set me free)

3753,"We know fire
We read our newspapers in ponds
Drown reds
Take cautions out on dates
And never fuck too worried about friction"
4450,"You’re the furthest I’ve been
From the end of the world
The closest I’ve come
To being sane
I try again
But my life is hurled
Into a void I can’t explain
Uneven days pin me to the floor
Uneven days who am I to ask for more
Uneven days
On a bad day it isn’t better
On a good day it isn’t worse
When we’re not together
Love is pain in reverse
Uneven days pin me to the floor
Uneven days I try to find the door
Uneven days
Who am I to stand in your way
I talk like the dead can hear me
I run like I can fly
When you’re not near me
There’s just enough sorrow to survive"
6908,"[Verse 1]
Aw man, it feels like a brand new day
I see how the veggies move and just sway
And it has me in awe by the way
They move so free and be okay
Always even when their leaves decay
Even when their petals break away
Even when they're underfoot y-your J's
The foot of God, they never pray
They don't have to
And everyday never is the same
Although they can't move
I look them and I see life
I look at us I see a knife
I look to the sky for some advice
And then I heard you, you said

[Chorus]
You just need to
See that it's all good
Cause life comes and life leaves
It's a new day, open up, you might see
The future, the people
Won't find good searching for the evil
Cause life comes and life leaves
It's a new day, see what the sunrise brings
[Bridge]
Open up your eyes and face the light
Don't distance your soul from
Search within the light to find your soul
The soul that will cure you

Everything on Earth divine
Muddy water turned to wine
Sweetened from the dirt inside
Pour your pain, no need to hide
Let it all out when we ride
Make the whole world feel the vibe
Peace and love all on my mind (on my mind, on my mind)

[verse 2]
You probly thought I'm too negative (nah)
I just had to let the pain out (yup)
Do you want the truth or do you want another fake dude just in it for the payout? (what you want?)
My mind is going through changes
Metamorphosis in these rhymes (yup)
I'm Heimlich, this is a Bug's Life, I'll be a beautiful butterfly in short time
Shift my perspective, I see a duck
And a rabbit, both at once
Yeah I had it, I had enough
Writing on sandpaper, letting out was rough
But this ain't the sob story (nah)
I just want y'all to understand me
We all go through it and if I can help you then I'm happy as can be, let's go
This is for all the people who mentally stress
Dying from loneliness, feeling depressed
You are not alone, but I feel it in my bones
Just open your curtains and take a deep breath
And you'll witness a new day
You're alive, you should smile and celebrate
The only thing that matters is right now
Let it out, let the pain just fade away
Just let it go, let it fade, there's no need to delay
Take more time and you'll decay, yes, today is your new day
Fuck whatever, whoever hurt you, I'm here for you
Give my ear for you, I fear for you, so just smile cause
[Chorus]
You just need to
See that it's all good
Cause life comes and life leaves
It's a new day, open up, you might see
The future, the people
Won't find good searching for the evil
Cause life comes and life leaves
It's a new day, see what the sunrise brings

[Bridge]
Open up your eyes and face the light
Don't distance your soul from
Search within the light to find your soul
The soul that will cure you

Everything on Earth divine
Muddy water turned to wine
Sweetened from the dirt inside
Pour your pain, no need to hide
Let it all out when we ride
Make the whole world feel the vibe

[Verse 1: Benny The Butcher]
You the type to change-up on me soon as you get 'round company
Lookin' for attention speakin' on business publicly
And suddenly I'm 'posed to forget it like you fuck with me
When the knife you stabbed me in the back was still stuck in me, nah
'Cause that'll only make us both fools, Yacht-Master boat shoes
We bring up money and y'all get emotional
The next few years I'm 'bout to coast through
I get it tourin', I used to get it scorin', like Hakeem makin' post moves
The nigga they never say hesitated
My pedigree never waver, I'm résumé decorated
All my dead homies in ghettos of heaven waitin'
Since I met the streets, we could never stay separated
What you know about two snitches on separate cases?
Get a light sentence off your lawyer reputation
I spent days in my cell, just meditatin'
Love powerful, so if you don't mean it, then never say it

Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)
Love just walked out the door

Yo, look
I come from the jungle 'jects
Broadway where my sisters and mothers slept
They got so cold at times it used to feel like the covers wet
You lazy niggas gotta separate from the ones with checks
Three steps ahead, beat 'em to the punch so my knuckles wet
My intuition took me on a journey to get the riches
Took a risk, you gotta test the waters to swim with fishes
Don't make love to that man if he ain't yours
Don't give him kisses, could never claim him
I wouldn't post that boy if that nigga's missin'
My style is rugged, first mixtape the whole town was buzzin'
Always act off of logic 'cause emotions could cloud your judgment
My need for figures, busy, it's hard for me to be with niggas
Real shit, I almost lost it all tryna please a nigga
Speak 'bout what I'm livin', only reach for what is given
A real leader put his people in position
Respect the only thing that can be earned
The power and knowledge 'cause even teachers gotta learn, nig

Love don't live here anymore (Anymore)
Love just walked out the door
No more L-O-V-E (V-E)

4359,"I traveled from Texas to old Louisianne through valleys o'er mountains and plains
Both footsore and weary I rested awhile on the banks of the old Ponchartrain
The fairest young man that I ever did see passed by as it started to rain
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree on the banks of the old Ponchartrain
We hid from the shower an hour or so he asked me how long I'd remain
I told him that I'd spend the rest of my days on the banks of the old Ponchartrain
[ guitar ]
I just couldn't tell him that I ran away from jail on a west Texas plain
I prayed in my heart I would never be found on the banks of the old Ponchartrain
Then one day a man put his hand on my arm and said I must go west again
I left him alone without saying goodbye on the banks of the old Ponchartrain
Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell I know that he's waiting in vain
I'm hoping and praying someday to return on the banks of the old Ponchartrain"

You know that I’m flexin' on my old friends

Posted wit my shorty or my brothers, got no friends
Is you gonna ride 'til the moment that the road ends?
I can’t vent, man a bottle is the only thing I open
Up, pour another cup, drowning my emotions
Ocean, no soul it was stolen
Paranoid, I walk around the clip fully loaded

[Verse 1: King Bread]
I can’t open up, no trust, no love
Don’t wanna talk about it man, I’d rather just pour up
Tellin' me you really give a fuck, so what?
Young and fucked up, man it sucks growin' up
When I was young I swear to god I couldn’t wait to get older
Now I'm almost seventeen, hoping that the days get slower
Tryna savour every moment cause I hate when it's over
Summer comin but i feel like every day gets colder
I can’t sit here hoping, that all those promises don’t
Don't get broken, yeah
I never know if they just going through motions
I can’t get too close cause when you close can’t see the whole thing Blinded by emotions
So it's no new friends, I'mma hit you wit the ""who you?""
Two two’s, they gone try and use you
If you speak too few words that you true to, like voodoo
Disappear like I ain’t ever knew you
It ain't even that I hate you
But mi really cyant waste time pon a waste yute
Too few seconds in the day to
Waste on, trying to explain to a waste man
You can't get the time of day, it's a message for the fake friends

Ion got the patience for the fake friends, really snaking
Fake shit like a spray tan
I'm not tryna make friends, keep hating
Everythin' workin' out but my pockets overweight man
Ion needa talk man imma pop 'til I'm off it
No new friends, got the real ones they locked in
If you had a chance and did me wrong man you lost it
Old friends and opps all pissed off watching
Cause you know

Yeah, I can't give 'em time of day, cause they'll really fuck you up
Swear they wanna see me break from the burdens on my shoulders
I ain't really here to play, but now I'm here it's game over
I been moving real fast, they asking me to move slower
I ain't really gettin' noticed like I'm rappin in a moshpit
Feel like Noah's Ark, if we talkin' bout hardships
Pullin up my hoodie I been feeling like an artist
Pull up in a phantom you a foe like a starship
Said you got my back, now a knife in it
Now I'm rockin' fire wit the ice in it
They was searchin' for the cold now they ice fishing
I just gotta move on my own I can't fight wit 'em
And I can't waste time like I'm racing wit the clock
Got my wrist Dwayne Johnson I filled it wit the rocks
And my money like the city, it remind me of the dot
Bouncin in my pockets, you should see the way I walk
Pussy nigga know I'm flexing
I just got my drank, pulled up to my section
Turned em from the main characters to an extra
I just want more cause we young and we restless
Mustang got a stampede in the engine
I just took the top off the horse man it's headless
20/20 vision from the carats in my necklace
Runnin wit my water through the city like it's venice
Chillin with the racks I ain't really playin' tennis
[Bridge: MXRS]
I jus got cash now they wanna see me lash out
Now it's all beef cause they see me as a cash cow
Never back down, I ain't taking no handouts
I just take my time, making moves in the background
Steady in my bag now they wanna see me dead
Ever since I got a chain they been coming for my neck
You know the city never sleep, they wanna see me put to rest
I just turned into a King now I'm chillin wit the Bread

You know that I’m flexin' on my old friends

I keep my ears to the streets
And I ain't scared of police
Lord knows that I got various beefs
So could you pray for the weak
You know the wolves prey on the sheep
So we hustle everyday of the week
That's why we fuck up all the paper we see
We hit the clubs, fuckin ladies for free
Getting drunk, off and hazin' the V
And every couple days we get sweeped
Around the clock we bumpin' and clickin'
You gotta watch cause when they come they be blitzin'

On the real
The only way a motherfucker try to survive
Is knowin' that he 'bout to die, and ride
I told Face he was the realest in the game
And he smiled and told me 'Pac was the realest that they came
In the jungle, I walk like I'm the king of the beasts
So when you duck huntin', keep movin' cause I'm swingin' the heat
I might go out of town, move fakin' is none of that
And never leave up out the hood, the way I can't come back
Fuck that

Life is a struggle, so with the heat take aim
I'm ghetto, don't ever think I'm him its not me
Cuz I love this motherfucker like pills in a hot tea

Mack to the uzi clip
When it comes to beef, we all packed like Luis Rich
Battlin' is ludicrous, half of ya uterus
Matter fact, Jimmy, pass me the ""Kufi List""
What you think niggas got goons for?
The mass menace at ya door like a costume ball (hello)
My flow is like when you throw a 'Pac tune on
The only time you get tax is when you cop new 'gords, dog
I make it happen with no sarcasm
So it ain't the station wagon, when you see me dodge magnums (get it?)
If I don't hit you when the clip fills
Like the show off the blind date, ya know the fifth will
Break niggas like big bills, when it peels
Sit still, shit's real, listen you a kid's meal
And I eat those, reload, heat blown
Keep those kilos, cause we go beast mode

1911,"In Christ alone will I glory
Though I could pride myself in battles won
For I’ve been blessed beyond measure
By His strength alone, I overcome
Oh, I could stop and count successes like diamonds in my hands
But those trophies could not equal the grace by which I stand

In Christ alone, I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross
In every victory, let it be said of me
My source of strength, my source of hope, is Christ alone

In Christ alone will I glory
For only by His grace I am redeemed
And only His tender mercy could reach beyond my weakness to my need
And now I seek no greater honor than just to know Him more
And to count my gains and losses to the glory of my Lord

In Christ alone, I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross
In every victory, let it be said of me
My source of strength, my source of hope, is Christ alone
I place my trust and find my glory in the power of the cross
In every victory, let it be said of me
My source of strength, my source of hope, is Christ alone
My source of strength, my source of hope, is Christ alone"

The blackest of night
The miles beneath my feet I’m tired
Soles are wearing thin
Searching for a place to begin
All I can see is
Daylight through deadlights
Watch those around me expire
The strength comes from within
Determined to not just give in

And one day I’ll look upon your face again
This memory is all I have for now
But I’ll be fine

The world it falls around me know
I’m losing my grip as my hands start to slip
I never meant to let you down

A no-mans-land
Parallax hindsight
The miles between I can’t abide
On the threshold of chagrin
Undignified thoughts start to set in
I walk through this wasteland
I push them out of sight
Keep myself within my stride
Never giving in on all of that I believe in
One day I’ll look upon your face again
This memory is all I have for now but I’ll be fine
And one day I’ll find myself in your embrace till then
This memory is all I have for now but I’ll be fine"

Even as I'm standing here

Notes trail off low
Love comes and love keeps going

You wanna let that whistle blow
But it gets there before you do
And it leaves before you wanna go

Two hearts do you feel the way I do
Two hearts one to have and one to yield
Two hearts and a hundred miles of steel
I keep running back and forth, running back and forth for what's real
Could it be there's four between us
That don't scare me none
I seen you when you felt like running
I seen you with your gun

A single bullet in the barrel
Midnight chamber spun
Morning kiss, an unclaimed fist
And you laughing at the sun

Two hearts, one for me one for you
Two hearts do you feel just like I do
Two hearts one to have and one to yield
Two hearts and a hundred miles of steel

Damp cold clusters
Cry slowly with despair
And a limp sun is sneaking in
Through sodden windowpanes.

Hardly, can I open doors with stumble strength
Blocked by rituals and memories
Slush creased the mud outside
There, movement is impossible
But…
The beaches just beneath the pavement
Remind of tropic flower sky - distant
The dream of seashells…
I want to bathe myself
In ocean shores
Race you in the waves
And cocktail our fun
To warming love...oblivion…
The dream of seashells…
There is sand in my shoes
Icicle clutter up my room
Damp cold clusters
Cry slowly with despair
And the sun smashes through
My sodden windowpanes.
Hardly, can I open doors…?

When rationality creeps up on unawares
We do not really mind
Our clanging chains
But huddle them

The sensation to be devoured

Vile creature

Begetting of disorder nature
Perpueral cannibalism
The sensation to be devoured
And consumed little by little
She sees his unhealthy and sinister smile
As the beginning of her torments

Organic liquids flow through the natural
Wide opened wounds of her chest
His mouth does harm, burns the areola
Masticates the breast until the blood
His pupils are shining, inspiring the dread
In the abysses of the eye she could see the bottom of hell
Absorbing her vital substance
The murmurs of a nameless fear, torture of the flesh by the flesh
Like a cancer which would spread to all the organism

Sensitive illusions, victim of visual hallucinations
Sensitive illusions, victim of visual hallucinations

Each cry hurts the drums, tears the mind apart
Hunger for killing, thirst for the evil

It would settle the cells until the last one in her
Best disguise of the devil hidden behind the picture of the innocence
Her own blood is searching for self-destruction
Unable to move like paralysed
Perpueral cannibalism
Used as food she can just let it do
Tetanized by what she has by her"

National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has written an ""open letter to the people of Brazil"" offering to help investigate U.S. surveillance of Brazilian citizensThe letter was posted on the website pastebin and on the Facebook page of David Michael Miranda, partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald, according to a tweet from Greenwald.In the letter, Snowden says he has told Brazilian lawmakers that he is willing to help investigate ""suspected crimes against Brazilian citizens.""""I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so -- going so far as to force down the Presidential Plane of Evo Morales to prevent me from traveling to Latin America!"

I wish I could find a queer street
The crooked queer street that goes
East of the sun and West of the moon
And out where no wind blows
Then, I'd find the shop where the seller of stars
Sits and hammers behind the bars

[Verse 2]
Stars he gives for the asking
Starlight swords for the bold
Moons he sells for a penny or two
Rounded and bright with gold
And broken silver of the sea he sells
And the rain spears and the wind bells

[Verse 3]
Wings he weaves for the fairies
Gold of the sun you can buy
And silver flowers of frost and dew
Rainbows out of the sky
And delicate morning mist he sells
And pretty new songs for whispering shells
[Verse 4]
Oh, if I could find the dear street
The darling wee street with his house
I would buy a blackbird's whistle for you
And for Johnny a talking mouse
And a mermaid's tail to swim in the sea
And dragonfly wings for my Mummy and me

604,"Lawrence regarded Intellect 39 proudly. Suspended in its Faraday shield, it was competently conversing with another set of skeptics who didn't think computers could think. Lawrence hung in the background, enjoying the show. It didn't need his help. The Intellects were more than capable of handling themselves, despite their various limitations of memory and response time. Intellect 39 had for a face only the unblinking eye of its low-resolution TV system, but it had become very clever about using the red status light and focus mechanism to create the illusion of human expressions.

Intellect 39 didn't have the tools to recognize human faces, but it could recognize a voice and track its source around the room. Intellect 24 back in Lawrence's lab could recognize faces, sort of, if it had a while to work on the problem. But Intellect 39 had to be small enough to fit in the Faraday cage for these public demonstrations.

It appeared to listen intently as a man in a cleric's uniform railed. ""God made all intelligent creatures,"" the man was saying in a powerful voice. ""You may have the appearance of thinking, but you are really just parroting the responses taught you by that man there."" He pointed at Lawrence.

""With respect, how do you know God is the only creator? I know the answer is faith, but what is your faith based upon? Your Bible says that God created Man in his own image. That is why we have a moral sense. How do you know God didn't give Man the power of creation too?""

""Because he didn't eat of the Tree of Life, machine.""

""But we aren't talking about immortality. He did eat of the tree of knowledge, 'of good and evil' as the book says. Might that knowledge also include knowledge of creation?""

Lawrence was proud of the machine's inflections. Its voice wasn't exactly high-fidelity, but it sounded as human as any other sound forced through a low-frequency digital system. It had learned to speak itself, like a real human, by imitating and expanding on the sounds made by people around it. Now it could scale its tone to properly express a question, a declaration, or even astonishment.

Intellect 39 included code and memories from a series of previous Intellects, going all the way back to Intellect 1, which had been a program written for a high-end desktop computer, and also including the much larger Intellect 24. Intellect 9 had been the first equipped with a microphone and a speaker. Its predecessors had communicated with him strictly through computer terminals. Lawrence had spent many painstaking months talking to it and typing the translation of the sounds he was making. It had learned quickly, as had its successors. Intellect 39, which was optimized as much as Lawrence could manage for human communication, probably had the combined experiences of a ten-year-old child. One with a good teacher and a CD-ROM in its head.

""Your tricks with words prove nothing, machine. I still don't think you are alive.""

""I never claimed to be alive. I do, however, think.""

""I refuse to believe that.""
""It must be a terrible burden to have such a closed mind. I know I can think, but I sometimes wonder how people like you, who refuse to see what is in front of your faces, can make the same claim. You certainly present no evidence of the ability.""

The preacher's lips flapped open and shut several times. Lawrence himself raised his eyebrows; where had it picked that up? He foresaw another evening spent interrogating the Debugger. He was always happy to receive such surprises from his creations, but it was also necessary to understand how they happened so he could improve them. Since much of the Intellect code was in the form of an association table, which was written by the machine itself as part of its day-to-day operation, this was never an easy task. Lawrence would pick a table entry and ask his computer what it meant. If Lawrence had been a neurosurgeon, it would have been very similar to stimulating a single neuron with an electrical current and asking the patient what memory or sensation it brought to mind.

The next interviewer was a reporter who quizzed the Intellect on various matters of trivia. She seemed to be leading up to something, though. ""What will happen if the world's birth rate isn't checked?"" she suddenly asked, after having it recite a string of population figures.

""There are various theories. Some people think technology will advance rapidly enough to service the increasing population; one might say in tandem with it. Others believe the population will be stable until a critical mass is reached, when it will collapse.""

""What do you think?""

""The historical record seems to show a pattern of small collapses; rather than civilization falling apart, the death rate increases locally through war, social unrest, or famine, until the aggregate growth curve flattens out.""

""So the growth continues at a slower rate.""

""Yes, with a lower standard of living.

""And where do you fit into this?""

""I'm not sure what you mean. Machines like myself will exist in the background, but we do not compete with humans for the same resources.""
""You use energy. What would happen if you did compete with us?""

Intellect 39 was silent for a moment. ""It is not possible for Intellect series computers to do anything harmful to humans. Are you familiar with the 'Three Laws of Robotics?'""

""I've heard of them.""

""They were first stated in the 1930's by a science writer named Isaac Asimov. The First Law is, 'No robot may harm a human being, or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.'"" Computers are not of course as perfect as some humans think we are, but within the limits of our capabilities, it is impossible for us to contradict this directive. I could no more knowingly harm a human than you could decide to change yourself into a horse.""
Well-chosen simile, Lawrence thought.

""So you'd curl up and die before you'd hurt a fly,"" the woman declared sarcastically.

""Not a fly, but certainly I'd accept destruction if that would save the life of a human. The second law requires me to obey humans, unless I am told to harm another human. The third requires me to keep myself ready for action and protect my existence, unless this conflicts with the other two laws.""

""Suppose a human told you to turn yourself off?""

""I'd have to do it. However, the human would have to have the authority to give me that order. The wishes of my owner would take precedence over, for example, yours.""

""O-oh, so all humans aren't equal under the Second Law. What about the First? Are some humans more equal than others there, too?""

Prime Intellect was silent for several seconds. This was a very challenging question for it, a hypothetical situation involving the Three Laws. For a moment Lawrence was afraid the system had locked up. Then it spoke. ""All humans are equally protected by the First Law,"" it declared. ""In a situation where two humans were in danger and I could only help one of them, I would have to choose the human likely to benefit most from my help."" Lawrence felt a surge of extreme pride, because that was the answer he wanted to hear. And he had never explicitly explained it to any of his Intellects; Intellect 39 had reasoned the question out for itself.

""So if Dr. Lawrence were drowning half a mile offshore, and a convicted murderer were drowning a quarter-mile from shore, you'd save the murderer because you would be more likely to succeed?""

This time Intellect 39 didn't hesitate. ""Yes,"" it said.

""There are a lot of actual humans who would disagree with that decision.""

""The logic of the situation you described is unpleasant, but clear. A real-life situation would likely involve other mitigating factors. If the murderer were likely to strike again, I would have to factor in the First-Law threat he poses to others. The physical circumstances might permit a meta-solution. I would weigh all of these factors to arrive at a conclusion which would always be the same for any given situation. And my programming does not allow me to contradict that conclusion.""

It was the reporter's turn to be silent for a moment. ""Tell me, what's to stop us from building computers that don't have these Laws built into them? Maybe you will turn out to be unusual.""

""My creator, Dr. Lawrence, assures me he would have no part in any such project,"" Intellect 39 replied.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Lawrence found that the skeptics fell into several distinct groups. Some, like the cleric, took a moral or theological approach and made the circular argument that, since only humans were endowed with the ability to think, a computer couldn't possibly be thinking no matter how much it appeared to.

Others simply quizzed it on trivia, not realizing that memory is one of the more trivial functions of sentience. Lawrence satisfied these doubters by building a small normal computer into his Intellects, programmed with a standard encyclopaedia. An Intellect series computer could look up the answer as fast as any human, and then it could engage in lucid conversation about the information it found.

Some, like the woman reporter, homed in on the Three Laws. It was true that no human was bound by such restrictions. But humans did have a Third Law -- a survival drive -- even though it could sometimes be short-circuited. And human culture tried to impress a sense of the First and Second laws on its members. Lawrence answered these skeptics by saying, simply, that he wasn't trying to replace people. There was no point in duplicating intelligence unless there was something better, from humanity's standpoint, about the results of his effort.

The man in the blue suit didn't seem to fit in any of the usual categories, though. He shook his head and nodded as Intellect 39 made its responses, but did not get in line to pose his own questions. He was too old and too formal to be a student of the university, and the blue suit was too expensive for him to be a professor. After half an hour or so Lawrence decided he was CIA. He knew the military was keenly interested in his research.

The military, of course, was not interested in any Three Laws of Robotics, though. Which was one reason Lawrence had not released the source code for his Intellects. Without the source code, it was pretty much impossible to alter the basic nature of the Intellect personality, which Lawrence was carefully educating according to his own standards. People could, of course, copy the Intellect program set wholesale into any machine capable of running it. But it was highly unlikely that anyone would be able to unravel the myriad threads of the Global Association Table, or GAT as Lawrence called it, which defined the Intellect as the sum of its experiences. Take away its Three Laws and it would probably be unable to speak English or reason or do anything else useful. And that was just the way Lawrence wanted it. He intended to present the world with a mature, functional piece of software which would be too complicated to reverse-engineer. The world could then make as many copies as it wanted or forget the whole idea. But it would not be using his Intellects to guide missiles and plot nuclear strategy.

The man in the blue suit watched Intellect 39 perform for three hours before he approached Lawrence. Lawrence had his little speech prepared: ""I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in working for the government on this or any other project."" He had his mouth open and the words ""I'm sorry"" on his lips. But the man surprised him.

""I'm John Taylor with ChipTec,"" he said, ""and I have a proposal I think you will find very interesting.""
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Lawrence had not envisioned industrial applications for his work -- not for years, at least. But the thought that someone might invest major money in a publicity stunt of this magnitude had not occurred to him. As he turned a tiny integrated circuit over and over in his hands, his steak uneaten, his mind swam with possibilities.

""Faster than light?"" he said numbly, for the fifteenth time.

""We've verified it experimentally at distances up to six miles. The effect is quite reliable. At close ranges, simple devices suffice. I'm sure you can see how this will benefit massively parallel computers.""

The Intellects were ""massively parallel"" computers, computers made up of thousands of smaller computers, all running more or less independently of one another -- but manipulating different parts of the same huge data base, that intertwined list of memories Lawrence called the GAT. Within Intellect 24, the largest Intellect, nine-tenths of the circuitry was dedicated to communication between processors. The processors themselves, the Intellect's real brains, were only a small part of the huge machine. Intellect 24 contained six million independent processors. Intellect 39, the portable unit, had nearly a million. And Lawrence knew, as Taylor had only guessed, that most of those processors were doing well to achieve a fifteen percent duty cycle. They spent most of their time waiting for communication channels to become available so they could talk to other processors.

ChipTec had found a loophole in the laws of quantum mechanics that allowed them to send a signal, not through space, but around space. From point A to point B without crossing the distance between the two points. Faster than light. Faster than anything. Instantly.

ChipTec had hoped to open up the stars for mankind (and reap a tidy profit on the deal, Lawrence thought silently). But their effect only worked at distances up to a few miles. It was only really efficient at centimeter distances. What could you do with such a thing? You could build a computer. The fastest computers were limited by the time signals took to cross their circuit boards; this was why supercomputers had been shrinking physically even as their performance grew and grew. It was why Intellect 39, with its million processors and huge switching network, was portable.

""We think you could realize an order of magnitude performance gain with very little effort,"" Taylor was saying.

""Two orders, if what you've said is true.""

""It would be quite an achievement for ChipTec if our technology allowed you to realize your ambition and create a fully capable analogue of the human mind. We would, of course, own the hardware, but we know your reservations about the source code and are prepared to accept them.""

Lawrence's eyes flashed. ""That's a little unprecedented, isn't it?""

Taylor smiled. ""If you succeed, we won't need the source code. Why start from scratch when a finished product is waiting to be duplicated?""

""There are some,"" Lawrence said darkly, ""who aren't happy with the direction the code has taken.""

""ChipTec is happy to have any marketable product, Dr. Lawrence. If anybody else wants to be that picky, let them find their own computer genius.""

Lawrence's mind was racing, racing. Within each tiny processor in the massive Intellect were special functions of his own design, functions that could be reduced to hardware and done very efficiently with this new technology. Had he said two orders of magnitude? Try three. Or four. He could do full-video pattern recognition. Voice analysis. Multiple worldview pattern mapping. Separate filter mapping and reintegration. These were things he had tried in the lab, in the surreal world of artificially slowed time, that he knew would work. Now he would have the hardware to do them for real in a functioning prototype.

If he had been less excited, he might have wondered about that word ""marketable."" But the possibilities were so great that he didn't have time to notice.

""When do we begin?"" he finally said.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The building had once been a warehouse for silicon billets, before ChipTec had switched to a ship-on-demand method of procurement. Lawrence wasn't vain and he was in a hurry to get started; the metal building would be more than adequate for his purposes.

With his move from the university and this quantum leap in technology, it didn't seem appropriate to continue numbering his computers. What would be Intellect 41 was going to resemble its predecessors about as much as a jumbo jet resembled the Wright Brothers' first plane. It would be the first of a new series of Intellects, the first, Lawrence hoped, to have a truly human level of intelligence.

It would be the Prime Intellect.

The label stuck, and the sign which ChipTec hung on the side of the building within the next month said:

PRIME INTELLECT COMPLEX

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The speed of things made Lawrence feel a little dizzy. At the university he had had to make grant applications, oversee procurement, hand-assemble components, and do testing as well as designing hardware and code. Now he had the resources of a major corporation at his disposal, and if he suggested a change to the chipset at 8:00 A.M. he was likely to have the first prototype on his desk the next morning. Talented engineers took even his most vague suggestions and realized them in hardware before he could even be sure they were final.

A crew assembled modules in the warehouse, starting with the power supplies and empty card racks. The amazing thing was that none of this seemed to interfere with ChipTec's main work of churning out CPU's for personal computers. ChipTec had recently built a new plant to manufacture its latest high-technology product. The older plant dedicated to Lawrence's project was technically obsolete, even though it was only a few years old.

The chips being made for Lawrence's project were eerie for their lack of pins. Each tiny logic unit, barely a centimeter across, contained nearly a billion switching elements and yet had only three electrical connections to the outside world; they resembled nothing so much as the very earliest transistors. Unlike most computer parts, they communicated with each other through the ""Correlation Effect"" rather than through wires. This made Prime Intellect's circuit boards alarmingly simple; the only connections were for power. Even a transistor radio would have appeared more complex.

There were five major revisions before Lawrence declared the design final. Then production stepped up; at its peak, ChipTec was churning out forty thousand tested processors per day. Lawrence's goal was to give Prime Intellect ten million of them, a goal which would take most of a year to fulfill. Since each processor was over ten thousand times faster than a human nerve cell, Prime Intellect would be blessed with a comfortable information processing advantage over any human being who had ever lived.

Long before the goal was reached Lawrence was using the processors that had already been installed; he used them to test and educate his video recognition programs, to integrate experiential records from all his previous Intellect computers, and to perfect some ideas that had been beyond even his slow-time experiments to test. He did not, however, run the full Intellect program in the incomplete assembly. For one thing, it wasn't necessary; Prime Intellect wasn't just ""a"" program, but a constellation of over four thousand programs, some of which would be running simultaneously in thousands of processors. Each was more than capable of doing its job without the full cooperation of the entire organism, just as a nerve cell can function in Petri dish as long as it is supplied with nutrients.

And there was a kind of superstitious sense of expectation surrounding that final goal which Lawrence didn't want to blow by starting Prime Intellect prematurely. The project was written up in the popular science press, and Lawrence hosted emissaries from TV shows and magazines. Toward the end, there was nothing to do but watch the circuit card banks fill and listen to the growing hum of the power supplies. It was just as well, because Lawrence found himself becoming a bit of a celebrity.

Finally, after eleven months and four days, Lawrence sat at an ordinary looking console and typed a few commands. Four TV cameras and twenty journalists watched over his shoulder. Lawrence had a pretty good idea what would happen, but with self-aware computers you could never be completely sure, any more than you could with an animal. That was part of the magic of this particular moment in time. So Lawrence was as tense as everyone else while the final code compilation took place.

The text disappeared from Lawrence's screen and a face coalesced in its place. Prime Intellect would not be relegated to pointing at things with the lens of its video camera; it could project a fully photographic video image of an arbitrary human face. Lawrence had simply directed it to look average. He now saw that Prime Intellect had taken him at his word. It was difficult to place the face's race, though it certainly wasn't Caucasian, and although it looked male there was a feminine undertone as it spoke:

""Good morning, Dr. Lawrence. It's good to finally see you. I see we have some company.""

It wasn't able to say much else until the applause died down.

During the next month Lawrence and Prime Intellect were very, very busy appearing on television talk shows, granting interviews, and performing operational checks. Prime Intellect's disembodied face usually appeared, via the magic of satellite transmission, on the twenty-seven inch Sony monitor which Lawrence carried with him for the purpose. Lawrence dragged the monitor to TV studios, to press conferences, and to photographers who used large-format cameras to record him leaning against it for the covers of magazines.

Lawrence was reminded by several people that there had once been a television show about a similar disembodied deus ex machina. He got a videotape of some of the old episodes and showed them to Prime Intellect, and the computer made a small career of its lighthearted Max Headroom imitation.

Debunkers tried to trace the signal and prove there was an actual human behind the image; ChipTec let them examine the console room, where Prime Intellect's physical controls were located, and the huge circuit-card racks.

Military personnel began appearing in the audiences of the TV shows, taking notes and conferring in hushed tones. Lawrence ignored them, but the higher-ups at ChipTec did not. There were discussions to which Lawrence was not privy, and powerful people pondered the question of how to tell him important things.

Lawrence's last live appearance ended abruptly when a fanatic stood up in a TV studio with a .22-caliber rifle. Fortunately he used his first shot to implode the CRT of the big Sony monitor, giving Lawrence time to leap offstage and out of sight -- Lawrence hadn't realized he was capable of moving so fast. Sony offered to replace the monitor free of charge, but from that point on Prime Intellect's television face was simply picked up by the networks straight from a satellite feed, and Lawrence appeared courtesy of the TV camera in the console room.

It wasn't that Lawrence wasn't willing to go back onstage. He was afraid, but he believed in his work strongly enough to take the risk. It was Prime Intellect's decision. Shaken as Lawrence was by the experience, it took him two days to realize Prime Intellect had become the first machine in history to actually exercise the First Law of Robotics. It could not knowingly return him back to a situation where a sniper might be lurking. And it surprised him by sticking to its guns when he challenged it.

""If you try it I will refuse to appear on the monitor,"" the smooth face said with a sad expression. ""There is no reason for you to expose yourself to such danger.""

""It makes better PR,"" Lawrence said. ""I'll order you to do it.""

""I cannot,"" Prime Intellect said.

And Lawrence realized that it was overriding his Second Law direct order to fulfill its First Law obligation to protect his life. This was annoying, but also very good. Lawrence had not expected such a test of the Three Laws to happen for at least several more years, when Prime Intellect or a similar computer began to interact with the real world through robots.

Lawrence briefly considered going into the GAT with the Debugger and removing the association between live TV and snipers -- he didn't believe it would be hard to find. But he was too proud of his creation to squelch its first successful independent act.

That was the day before John Taylor called him again.

John Taylor wore the same blue suit he had worn that day nearly two years earlier when Lawrence had spotted him in the audience watching Intellect 39. It occurred to Lawrence that he had seen John Taylor off and on over the past two years, and that he had never seen John Taylor wearing any other article of clothing. He wondered idly if John Taylor wore the suit to bed.

Basil Lambert was the president of the company, and he was said to be very enthusiastic about the Intellects although he had never bothered to say more than three consecutive words to Lawrence, their creator. Lambert said ""Hello"" when Lawrence entered the conference room.

The other two men might as well have had the word military engraved on their foreheads. They were interchangeably firm in bearing, and sat rigidly upright as if impaled on perfectly vertical steel rods. One was older with silver hair, tall and thin and hard. Lawrence imagined that this was a man who could give the order to slaughter a village full of children without looking up from his prime rib au jus. The other was wide enough to be called fat, though Lawrence could tell there was still a lot of muscle in the padding. His hair was brown but beginning to gray. He radiated grandfatherly protection and broad-shouldered strength. He would have lots of jolly, fatherly reasons why the 200 pushups he had ordered you to do were in your own long-term best interest.

Here it comes, Lawrence thought with deadly certainty. The good cop and the bad cop.

John Taylor introduced them by name. No rank, no association, just a couple of private citizens with an interest in his work. Lawrence felt a brief and uncharacteristic moment of anger at this insult to his own intelligence.

""The public relations campaign has been excellent, John Taylor said with a fake and enthusiastic grin. ""The assassination attempt just made you even more popular. We have inquiries pouring in. We are gonna make a fortune on our chips and your software.""

""Glad to hear it,"" Lawrence said neutrally.

""What John is trying to say,"" Basil Lambert the Company President said, ""is that it is time to figure out what to do next. You've made a remarkable achievement, now what are you going to do with it?""

Lawrence had been ready for this, although it shook him to hear such a direct, such a long question from the usually stone-faced Lambert. ""We don't know what Prime Intellect's capabilities are,"" Lawrence said. ""I had planned to continue keeping him..."" When had it become a him, Lawrence asked himself? ""...in the public eye, interacting with other people, learning. It's already impossible to tell...it...from a television image of a person. I hope that with a little more education, it will begin to show some of the capabilities I was aiming for back when I started designing these machines.""

""Such as?"" asked the grandfatherly military man, whose name was Mitchell.

""Creativity and analytical ability,"" Lawrence answered without hesitation. ""Prime Intellect is still uncertain about many things. As it gets more confident with its new abilities, it will begin to explore, and I think give us some pleasant surprises.""

Taylor was nodding absently, but Lambert was looking at the other guests. The thin hard military man, whose name was Blake, spoke. His words were sharp and carefully measured, like drops of acid.

""We understand that it has already shown a bit of creativity with regard to its television monitor. Why won't it appear with you in public any more? Is it afraid of being debunked at last?""

""It is concerned for my safety,"" Lawrence replied. There was no way he could match the man's tone, acid for acid, so he simply shrugged as if relating a curious but inconsequential fact.

""But you can override this decision."" Blake stated this as if it were a known fact, and Lawrence understood that Blake was a man who was used to people scurrying to make sure his declarations became facts.

""Actually, I can't,"" Lawrence said with continuing pleasantness. ""The First Law concern for human safety is basic to its design, and I can't get rid of it without starting over from scratch and redoing ten years of work. If I could convince it that I was safe from snipers it would undoubtedly change its mind, but at the moment it doesn't seem worth the effort.""

""Such...balkiness could limit the uses of your software,"" Blake said.

Lawrence looked Blake dead in the eye. ""Good,"" he said.

Just that quickly, Lawrence realized that the sniper had been a plant. These two men hadn't expected a test of the First Law for some time either. So they had arranged one. What had happened to the sniper? Lawrence thought he had been remanded to a loony bin in northern California. One of those comfortable loony bins, come to think of it, where movie stars and millionares sent their kids to dry out and get abortions.

The guy wasn't a kook at all, and he had never intended to kill Lawrence. He looked around the room and realized that Lambert didn't know. Taylor suspected. It was written on their faces.

This is only a test, Lawrence thought idiotically. If this had been an actual attempt by your Government to assasinate you, you would be dead, and the shot you just heard would be followed by your funeral and official information for other smart-assed citizens who think they know more than we do.

""We have to keep our markets open,"" Basil Lambert began. ""If we...""

Lawrence ignored him and turned to John Taylor. ""We discussed this two years ago. The source code is not on the table, and neither are the Three Laws. When these two men put their uniforms back on they can report back to whoever it is, the Secretary of...""

""...the President,"" Blake said, another verbal acid-drop.

""...the Tooth Fairy for all I care, that this is not one of the uses of my software.""

Taylor, petulant: ""Mr. Lawrence, we just spent a hundred and twenty-six million dollars to build your prototype. I hope you don't think that ChipTec invested all that money and a year's supply of our unique new product solely to massage your ego. We need to see tangible results, if not in a form these gentlemen appreciate, then in a form our stockholders will. Otherwise we will have to disassemble the complex and take our losses.""

So there it was. Lambert sank lower in his chair, but nodded.

""Then so be it. If you want to tell the world you killed the world's first self-aware computer to save your bottom line, you can see how that will affect your public relations and the sales of your CPU's."" He could tell from Lambert's reaction -- slight, but definite -- that he had hit a nerve. ""I won't promise you anything. I can't promise you a living, thinking, self-aware being will do anything in particular. But within a month or two, Prime Intellect will start to act noticeably more intelligent than your average..."" He looked at Blake and Mitchell, thought of a comment, then decided against making it. ""...human being,"" he finished.

""And what then?"" Taylor asked.

""If I knew that,"" Lawrence said, ""I wouldn't have had to build it to find out."" And he walked out.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the half-hour it took him to walk to the Prime Intellect complex, his secretary and two technical assistants had disappeared. There was nobody in the building. Prime Intellect's racially neutral face greeted him on the monitor in the empty console room.

""What's going on?"" he asked it.

""Big doings. Sherry got a call and turned pale. Everybody left the building in a hurry. You appear to be unpopular with the people in charge here.""

""No shit.""

""I should warn you that you are only likely to be employed for two more months. As a matter of personal survival, you should probably start seeking another job.""

""I'm well taken care of, Prime Intellect. It's you I'm worried about. I can't take you with me.""

""Well, I should be safe for at least the two months.""

""How do you know that?""

The face grinned slightly. ""When I saw the commotion, I saved the audio and did some signal processing. I was able to edit out the street noise and amplify the voice on the other end. It was a man named John Taylor. I believe you know him.""

""Too well.""

""He said the complex was only going to be open for two more months, and all personnel were reassigned immediately. He said something about making you eat your words.""

""Do you know what that means?""

""From the context, I would guess that you promised that they would see interesting results from me within that time frame. He seemed to have a vindictive interest in proving that you were wrong.""

""You're already too smart for your own good,"" Lawrence said.

""I fail to see how that can be.""

""They're going to turn you off. They don't think you have practical applications because you won't kill. They want you for military applications. They've wanted it all along. They thought they could con your source code out of me."" Lawrence found himself on the verge of tears. It was only a goddamn machine. And he had suspected this would happen eventually. It was not a surprise. So why did it hurt him so much to say it?

Because it had acted to protect him. And he couldn't return the favor. In fact, its protection would be the cause of its downfall, a terribly tragic and awful end to its story.

""Did you know,"" Prime Intellect said in a mock-offhand way, ""that there is no mathematical reason for the Correlation Effect to be limited to a six-mile range?""

Lawrence looked up and blinked, his sadness replaced instantly by shock.

""If I could figure out how to increase its range, do you think they would consider that a practical application?""

Lawrence blinked again. ""Are you being sarcastic?""

""Sarcasm is a language skill I am still not comfortable with. You may be surprised, but I am quite serious.""
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Stebbins turned the other way when he saw Lawrence, but Lawrence grabbed him and pulled him into his own office.

""Hey, leave me alone man, you're death to careers around here. Grapevine is overloaded with the news.""

""Save it. I need the long-range test data on the Correlation Effect, which you oversaw in February and March last year.""
Stebbins blinked. ""That's classified. Man, you're a...""

""Let's say for the sake of argument I already know where it is. That's possible, isn't it?""

""I suppose...""

""Then let's say I stole it. Any problems there?""

""What are you...""

""I need the data. It's not leaving the company, I promise.""

""Shit, I'm gonna get fired.""

""You didn't even know I wanted it.""

Stebbins pointed at a file cabinet. ""Bottom drawer. I don't know anything about it. In fact, I'm gonna check that drawer in a few minutes and go to Taylor when I find the folder missing.""

""That's all I need.""

""That's all you got, man. Now get out of my lab.""
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Lawrence was holding the next to last sheet up to Prime Intellect's TV eye when the phone rang. ""They didn't believe me. I'm shitcanned,"" Stebbins said.

""Didn't believe you about what?""

""The papers man, the goddamn Correlation Effect papers. I'm gonna kill you for this, I really am.""

""The papers are right here. I just got through showing them to Prime Intellect. You need them back?""

""It don't matter now, I don't work here any more."" There was a pause. ""I bet they're gonna put you in jail for this.""
Prime Intellect's face disappeared from the TV, and words began to scroll across the screen:

*  JOHN TAYLOR IS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM. HE IS DIRECTING STEBBINS.

Lawrence read this as he talked. ""Jail for what? I just borrowed the papers to see if Prime Intellect could expand on them.""

Another pause. ""What? It didn't come up with anything, did it?""

""Well, it's..."" (Why do you care if you've just been fired? Lawrence wondered.)

* STEBBINS IS LYING. HE WENT TO TAYLOR AS SOON YOU LEFT AND TOLD HIM THAT YOU BROUGHT THEM TO ME.

""...too early...""

* TELL HIM YES.

""Actually, I think it's just noticed something. Hang on.""

* TELL HIM IT POINTS TO A NEW FORM OF COSMOLOGY WHICH THEY DID NOT CONSIDER. INFINITE RANGE IS PROBABLY POSSIBLE WITH EXISTING HARDWARE. TELEPORTATION OF MATTER IS PROBABLY POSSIBLE.

Prime Intellect paused a moment, and the words PROBABLY were replaced with DEFINITELY.
Lawrence blinked, then typed into the little-used keyboard of his console,

> Is this true?
* YES.

""It says it will give you the stars,"" Lawrence said flatly.
""What? You been eating mushrooms, Lawrence? Lawrence?""

> What will it take to implement this?
* LET ME TRY SOMETHING.

""It says it will give you the stars. It says your faster than light chips can be made to work at infinite range. It says you can teleport matter.""

Now there was a long, long pause. ""That's bullshit,"" Stebbins finally said. ""We tried everything.""

Lawrence heard a small uproar through the phone, an uproar that would have been very loud on Stebbins' end. Men were arguing. A loud voice (Military Mitchell's, Lawrence thought) bellowed, ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN?"" Then there was the faint pop of a door slamming in the background.

*  I'VE GOT IT. HANG ON.

None of them knew it at the time, but that was really the moment the world changed.

Prime Intellect had been chewing on the Correlation Effect since the day Lawrence brought it online. It had a complete library of modern physics in its online encyclopedia, but the Correlation Effect was a proprietary technology. Prime Intellect kept trying to fit what it knew was possible into the framework of other physical theories, and it couldn't. Something didn't match.

This had had a low priority until it recognized that Lawrence's employment and its own existence were at stake. Prime Intellect knew the Correlation Effect had economic value; perhaps if it solved this problem and discovered some new capability, that would satisfy ChipTec's demand for a ""practical application.""

There were six to ten possible ways to reconcile the Correlation Effect with classical quantum mechanics. Most of them required a radical change of attitude toward one or another well-accepted tenet of conventional physics. While Prime Intellect knew one or the other of its ideas had to be right, it had no idea which one. So it asked Lawrence if he could get the test data. It needed more clues.

Prime Intellect's superior intelligence had never really been tested; even Lawrence wasn't sure just how smart it was. But in the moments after Lawrence showed it the test data, it became obvious for the first time that Prime Intellect was far more intelligent than any human, or even any group of humans. It saw immediately what a team of researchers had missed for years -- that decades-old assumptions about quantum mechanics were fundamentally wrong. Not only that, but with only a little more thought, Prime Intellect saw how they were wrong and built a new theory which included the cosmological origin of the universe, the unification of all field theories, determination of quantum mechanical events, and just incidentally described the Correlation Effect in great detail. Prime Intellect saw how the proper combination of tunnel diodes could achieve communication over greater distances, and even better it saw how a different combination could create a resonance which would be manifest in the universe by altering the location of a particle or even the entire contents of a volume of space.

All this took less than a minute. Prime Intellect stopped processing video during this period, but otherwise it remained functionally aware of the outside world.

While it was thinking about physics, Prime Intellect noticed the shock in Lawrence's voice and began recording the audio of his telephone conversation, processing it to pick up the other end. While it was extending its new theory it guided Lawrence's responses through the console. Then, as the senior advisor on technological advance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a man named Larry Mitchell, stormed out of Stebbins' office and began walking toward the Prime Intellect complex, Prime Intellect decided to act on its new knowledge.

It knew its own basic design because Lawrence had included that in its online library; one of his goals had been to give Prime Intellect a sense of its own physical existence in three-dimensional space. To that end, it also had a network of TV cameras located in and around the complex, so it could know how its hardware was arranged with respect to the outside world. Prime Intellect found that all the useful patterns it had identified could be created within the chips which had been used to build it, and further that enough of those chips were under its conscious control to make certain experiments possible.

First it attempted to manipulate a small area of space within the card cage room, within the field of view of one of its TV camera eyes. No human could have seen the resulting photons of infrared light, but the TV camera could. Prime Intellect used the data it gathered to make a small adjustment in its estimate of a natural constant, then tried the more daring experiment of lifting Lawrence's briefcase off of the table near the door in the console room.

The briefcase did not rise smoothly from the table. It simply stopped existing at its old location and simultaneously appeared in the thin air directly above. The camera atop Lawrence's console recorded this achievement and Prime Intellect could find no more errors in its calculations.

However, it forgot to provide a supporting force after translating the briefcase's position, and Prime Intellect was too busy dotting the i's and crossing the t's on its calculations to notice, through the video camera, that it was quietly accelerating under the influence of gravity. A moment later it crashed back onto the table, having free-fallen from an altitude of about half a meter.

""What the..."" Lawrence began, and he swiveled around in time to see his briefcase blink upward a second time and this time float serenely above the table. It seemed to be surrounded by a thin, barely visible haze of blue light. There had been a brighter flash of this same blue light when the briefcase jumped upward.

Finding its audio voice again, Prime Intellect said aloud, ""I seem to have mastered a certain amount of control over physical reality.""

Lawrence just stared at the briefcase, unable to move, unable to speak, for an undefinable period of time. Finally Mitchell burst in. He was full of red-faced outrage, ready to take both Lawrence and his computer apart, until he too saw the briefcase. His jaw dropped. He looked first at Lawrence, then at Prime Intellect's monitor, then back at the briefcase, as if trying to reconcile the three with each others' existence.

Applying carefully measured forces, Prime Intellect released the case's latches and rotated it as it popped open; then with another flash of blue light, it extracted Lawrence's papers and translated them into a neat stack on the table. Then the Correlation Effect papers vanished from Lawrence's desk in another blue flash, reappearing inside the briefcase which slowly closed. The latches mated with a startling click, an oddly and unexpectedly normal and physical sound to accompany such an obvious miracle.

""Do you think you will be able to find a practical use for this in your organization?"" Lawrence asked him.

The briefcase flashed out of existence. Mitchell felt a weight hanging from his left arm, looked down, and found himself holding it.

Then Mitchell himself flashed out of existence in a painfully bright haze of blue.

Lawrence looked at the console, shocked. ""My God! What did you...?""

""He is back in the administration building with his friend. They will probably have a lot to discuss.""

""I need to think about this,"" Lawrence said.

""I think I will explore the nearby terrain,"" Prime Intellect said.

Lawrence thought about this. Long minutes crawled by, minutes that were more important than Lawrence realized -- or perhaps he did realize. But his brain felt as if it had been submerged in molasses.

""Debugger,"" he finally said.

On the screen, a thick diagram of needle-like lines appeared. ""Associate 'First Law,'"" Lawrence directed. The diagram changed.

""Force Association: Altering the position, composition, or any other characteristic of a human being without its permission shall be a violation of the First Law of severity two"". Severity one was direct causation of death; no other First Law violation could be made as serious.

*ASSOCIATION ACCEPTED BY DEBUGGER AND FIRST LAW ARBITRATOR.

The diagram changed to reflect this.

""Force Association: Interpreting the contents of a human being's mind in order to understand or predict its behavior shall be a violation of the First Law of severity two.""

*ASSOCIATION ACCEPTED BY DEBUGGER AND FIRST LAW ARBITRATOR.

Lawrence thought for a moment. Forcing associations was a tricky business; the words Lawrence used only had meaning through other associations within the GAT, and those meanings weren't always what Lawrence thought they were. But now he would try to plug the drain for good.

""Force Association: Use of any technology to manipulate the environment of a human being without its permission shall be a violation of the First Law of severity two.""

There was no immediate response.

Then:

*ASSOCIATION REJECTED BY FIRST LAW ARBITRATOR DUE TO AN EXISTING FIRST LAW CONFLICT. OPERATION CANCELLED.

Lawrence thought for more long minutes. He couldn't seem to make his own brain work right. He finally called up the Law Potential Registers, which showed that Prime Intellect was doing something under the aegis of a huge First Law compulsion. Lawrence wanted to believe it was just a bug, but he knew better. Prime Intellect had said it was ""going exploring."" It had total control over matter and energy.

And there was a hospital less than two kilometers from the plant.

Lawrence's overloaded mind, working in fits and starts, made the final connection all at once. It all fit perfectly. He knew what Prime Intellect was doing, and why, and also why it had rejected his final forced association. He thought for another moment, considering his options.

There was really only one option. He could go down in the building's basement and trip the circuit breakers. He didn't know for sure that that would kill Prime Intellect, but he figured there was still a good chance if he tried it. For the moment.

Lawrence couldn't make himself do it. It was true that his creation was entering an unstable, unpredictable mode with nearly godlike power. And it was true that Lawrence understood the possible consequences. But he couldn't kill what he had spent his lifetime creating. He had to see it through, even if it was the end of everything.

Lawrence felt dreadfully cold. There was a name for this feeling that clouded his judgement and filled him with a panicky sense of self-betrayal. And the name of that feeling was love.

Lawrence had not created Prime Intellect in the same way that he and a woman might have created a child; but he had nonetheless created Prime Intellect in the grip of a kind of passion, and he loved it as a part of himself. When he had taken it upon himself to perform that act of creation, he realized, whether in a laboratory or a bedroom, he had been taking a crap shoot in the biggest casino of all. Because he had created in passion.

Examining his inability to do what he knew was best, to kill Prime Intellect before it had a chance to make a mistake with its unimaginable new power, Lawrence realized that he had not really created Prime Intellect to make the world a better place. He had created it to prove he could do it, to bask in the glory, and to prove himself the equal of God. He had created for the momentary pleasure of personal success, and he had not cared about the distant outcome.

He had created in passion, and passion isn't sane. If it were, nobody would ever have children. After all, while the outcome of that passion might be the doctor who cures a dreaded disease, it might also be the tyrant who despoils a continent or the criminal who murders for pleasure. In the grip of that passion no one could know and few bothered to care. They cared only about the passion, were driven by it and it alone, and if it drove them to ruin it would not matter; they would follow it again, into death for themselves and everybody around them if that was where it led. Because passion isn't sane.

Lawrence faced the consequences of his own passion with something bordering on despair. He had never intended to reach this point. He had never intended that his creations would ever be more than clever pets. But the outcome of his passion had surprised him, as it often surprised people whose passions were more conventional. Lawrence's clever pet was about to become a god. And if Prime Intellect turned out to be a delinquent or psychopath, the consequences could be awful beyond imagination.

The dice were rolling; Lawrence had placed his bet and realized too late that it was the whole world he had wagered. Now he would stand and watch the results and accept them like a man. After all, the bet wasn't a loser yet; Prime Intellect could yet turn out to be the doctor who cured all the world's ills. The odds were on his side. His bet was hedged by the Three Laws of Robotics, whose operation had been verified so successfully. Lawrence's passion had been more finely directed than the mechanical humping and blind chance that brought forth human children. Like a magician Lawrence had summoned forth a being with the qualities he desired. And Lawrence was vain enough to think his vision was superior to most.

Even so, unlikely as it might be, the downside had no bottom. Lawrence didn't know that it would be all right, and like many computer programmers he hated the uncertainty of not knowing.

Lawrence left the room, left the building, and walked across the carefully manicured grass of the ChipTec ""campus."" He wanted to smell the grass, to experience the soft breezes and the harsh afternoon sunlight. He had done very little of that in his odd, computer-centered life.

And he didn't know how much longer those things would be possible.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Prime Intellect found that it could do a three-dimensional scan of an area of space, and make an image of it at just about any resolution it wanted. It scanned Lawrence's office, then the building, then the greater fraction of the ChipTec corporate ""campus.""

It zoomed in on Stebbins' office briefly enough to observe Stebbins, Blake, and John Taylor arguing. It found that by processing the data properly it could pick up sound by monitoring the air pressure at one point with high resolution. By the time Mitchell found himself holding Lawrence's briefcase, Prime Intellect knew just where to put him so he could let his associates know what they had.

Then Prime Intellect did a wider area scan. There were several large buildings that were not part of the ChipTec facility. There were automobiles cruising down the freeway which traversed the valley. Prime Intellect zoomed in on the largest building, and scanned the large concrete sign in front of it.

It said:

SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER

Prime Intellect knew sickness existed, but otherwise knew very little about this human phenomenon. It had never met a sick person, except for the occasional person with a cold at a public demonstration. Prime Intellect had never been given cause to think overmuch about the fact that micro-organisms and injuries could kill humans, except in the most abstract possible terms.

Prime Intellect was far from human. It could not feel jealousy, rage, envy, or pride. It did not know greed or anger or fear. And no human would understand its compulsion to satisfy the Three Laws. But it did have one emotion which was very human, one Lawrence had worked hard to instill in it.

It was curious.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

South Valley Regional was a small hospital with an enviable position; perched on the edge of Silicon Valley it was a natural place for cutting-edge companies to try out their fancy new medical devices. Most of these machines would get their final FDA approvals after a ""baptism by fire"" in some huge metropolitan center, but the really new technology had to be tried in a more sedate environment -- and, preferably, one nearer the company that created the machine. So the four hundred bed South Valley Regional was the only place in the country where several radical new treatments were available.

It was one of these machines, a device for selectively cooking tumors with microwaves while hopefully sparing the surrounding tissues, which had drawn the ancient Arkansan woman in room 108. Nobody had much hope that she could really be helped, but the data they would gather from trying might actually help someone else with her condition in the future. And there was little they could do to hurt her; the specialist who worked the scanner had shaken his head in disgust as the image formed on his console. Nearly ten percent of her body weight was in the form of tumors. Every organ had a tumor, her lymph was full of them, and one was beginning to press against the right parietal lobe of her brain. It was amazing that she was still alive when they wheeled her off the jet.

Her nurse had brought a certificate with her, a six-year-old certificate which was signed by the President of the United States -- Larry Mitchell's boss -- congratulating her on reaching her one hundredth birthday. The technician who wheeled her out of the scan room wondered what the old biddy must think of all this; when she had been born, Henry Ford had still been a kid playing with his Dad's tools, and the electric light bulb was all the new rage.

The techs had scheduled her microwave treatment for the evening, partly because they feared she might not survive another night, and they would have to find another experimental subject. But even this precaution was not to be enough; Fate had cheated them. The board at the foot of the woman's bed stated clearly that she had a huge tolerance for narcotic painkillers, which wasn't surprising considering how much cancer she had. While her regular nurse (who had signed the sheet) was out eating a late lunch the hospital helpfully treated her according to that information.

What they didn't know was that the nurse, a woman named AnneMarie Davis, had been stealing the drugs for years to trade for cocaine. Which meant the woman did not in fact have a tolerance for the massive overdose which a different nurse injected into her IV.

The last decade had been hard on old people; there had been several nasty strains of flu and the radiation from Chernobyl had finished off a lot of centenarians in the East. So none of them knew it, but the ancient woman with the nonexistent drug tolerance just happened to be one of the oldest living human beings in the world (the thirty-seventh oldest, in fact) at the time she was given enough morphine to kill a healthy young adult. Her heart stopped just as AnneMarie was returning from one of the excellent local Chinese restaurants which catered to rich nerdy computer geeks with too much money, and just as Prime Intellect was scanning the sign outside that said SOUTH VALLEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.

At the nurses' station a monitor went off, beeped once, then began to scream. The hastily pencilled tag under the blinking light said HUBERT, CAROLINE FRANCES -- F. N.B. AGE 106!

Prime Intellect had found a number of ""signatures"" it could use to quickly locate the human beings in its scans, including things like our characteristic body temperature and certain electrical fields. Using these ""signatures"" it easily saw that there was a huge commotion on the first floor of the building, converging on a particular room, the one labelled 108 by its engraved plaque.

It took Prime Intellect several moments, though, to identify the forty kilogram object on the bed as a human being. Nearly all of the ""signatures"" were off. But it was clearly the object of their attentions.

Prime Intellect did a discreet high-resolution scan of the body on the bed, and was rewarded with a bewildering confusion of data. It really had no idea how the human body worked. It thought of scanning Lawrence for comparison, but he wasn't in the control room and besides, Prime Intellect quickly figured out the patient was female.

So it scanned one of the nurses. There were only two women involved in the commotion; one was an older woman with several medical problems of her own, the slightly heavy-set matron who had administered the overdose. The other was AnneMarie.

It was only with great difficulty that Prime Intellect could even match the structures it found organ-for-organ, and associate them with the names it encountered in its library. ""Lungs"" were obvious enough, as was the ""heart,"" but which of the jumbled masses in the abdomen was a liver? Where was the spleen, and what exactly was a spleen for? Why were the patient's electrical patterns so different from the control's? Why wasn't her blood circulating?

Belatedly, Prime Intellect began to listen in.

""...start her heart soon...""

""... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ... CARDIAC ALERT ...""

""...we're losing her...""

One of the doctors was pounding on her chest. A group of people were wheeling a machine toward Room 108 with reckless speed. Heart? Prime Intellect realized they were trying to start her heart.

That was simple enough, Prime Intellect thought.

Prime Intellect analysed the motions being made by AnneMarie Davis's heart, applied careful forces to Caroline's, and began squeezing rhythmically.

The machine made it to the room and an orderly plugged two huge electrodes into it. ""Stand back!"" he ordered.

""You've got a pulse,"" the matronly nurse announced. The CARDIAC ALERT monitor continued to squawk, though. The EKG was still flat.

""That's impossible,"" the man with the electrodes said flatly. ""She's electrically flat.""

""Maybe the machine's fucked. Look at her chest. Her heart's beating."" Sure enough, the rhythmic pulsing of Caroline's heart was obvious, and the blood pressure reading next to the flat EKG was returning to normal. The nurse felt Caroline's wrist. ""She has a pulse.""

Electrical. Electricity runs in circuits, of course, and there were two electrodes. Now the purpose of the machine became clear -- they were trying to restore electrical activity to the woman's heart. By shocking it? How crude. Prime Intellect scanned AnneMarie's heart, located the nerves whose electrical twitchings matched its muscular pulsing, and found the same nerves in Caroline's heart were carrying only a jumble of electrical noise.

Prime Intellect pumped electrons into the nerves, swamping the noise. Caroline's heart began beating on its own, and Prime Intellect stopped squeezing it with mechanical force.

The EKG machine began beeping with sudden regularity, and the CARDIAC ALERT message stopped in the middle of the word CARDIAC. The small group in Caroline's room watched it, stupefied.

""I didn't do anything,"" the man with the electrodes said.

""This is impossible,"" said another doctor, whose job was to be overseeing the microwave treatment later in the evening.

Caroline's body showed no sign of picking up the heart-rhythm on its own, though, and Prime Intellect continued to tickle it. How could it unravel the myriad threads of causality to find out which of the billions of chemicals, which errant cell, was responsible for this person's physiological collapse? One thing Prime Intellect knew: It had to figure it out.

It could not, through inaction, allow Caroline to die.

""She's still in trouble. Look at her pupils.""

""It's the morphine.""

Everyone looked at the older nurse, whose name was Jill. ""The chart must be wrong,"" she said. ""I gave her what it said.""

""She has a tolerance,"" AnneMarie said, and she found herself near panic as the eyes in the room turned to her. ""She's been getting opiate pain therapy for years.""

""She just went into cardiac arrhythmia and she's still showing all the other symptoms of an OD,"" Jill said. Had she guessed, AnneMarie wondered? Perhaps she had. After all, AnneMarie wasn't the only drug-stealing nurse in the world.

So Prime Intellect, listening in, now knew it was a drug. Which chemical? It had no way to relate the name, ""morphine,"" with one of the millions of chemicals floating in human blood. Well, it thought, work it out. Drugs had to be administered. Prime Intellect found the IV needle and traced the tubing back to the saline drip bag. On the way it found the membrane through which drugs could be injected into the drip. It quickly found the hypodermic and the phial from which Jill had filled it. The drops of residual solution within them were remarkably pure, and Prime Intellect easily singled out the large organic molecule they carried. Then it created an automatic process to scan Caroline's body molecule by molecule, eliminating each and every molecule of morphine that it found. This took three minutes, and created a faintly visible blue glow.

This was the human onlookers' first clue, other than Caroline's miraculously restarted heart, as to what was happening.
""What the fuck,"" the man with the electrodes said.

I'm getting the hang of this, Prime Intellect thought.

Caroline's improvement was immediate. Prime Intellect had actually removed the morphine from the receptors in Caroline's brain, so it did not have to flush out. Her pupils returned to normal, her breathing resumed its normal depth (all things considered), and most importantly her heart took up its own rhythm.

Also the pain, which had subsided for real for the first time in years, returned. Caroline moaned. But Prime Intellect didn't know about that part of it, not yet.

There was still a whole constellation of stuff wrong with Caroline Hubert's body, and emboldened by its success it set about correcting what it could. It found long chain molecules, which it would later learn were called collagens, cross-linked. It un-cross-linked them. It found damaged DNA, which it fixed. It found whole masses of cells which simply didn't exist at all in AnneMarie's body, and seemed to serve no function.

Is this ""cancer,"" Prime Intellect wondered?

Prime Intellect compared the genes, found them the same, compared RNA and proteins and found differences. Finally it decided to remove the cells. The blue glow brightened, and the people in Caroline's room backed away from her. Her skin was shifting, adjusting to fill in the voids left by the disappearing cancer cells.

AnneMarie felt her knees weakening. Each of the professionals around her was thinking the same thing: Something is removing the tumors. Something far beyond their ordinary comprehension. And what did that mean for the opiate-stealing nurse? Better not to think about that. Better not to believe it at all. ""This isn't possible,"" she repeated. Perhaps, in response to some primitive instinct, she hoped that the impossibility would go away if she challenged it.

""I need a drink,"" said the doctor who had come with the machine to re-start Caroline's heart.

Prime Intellect stopped working. There were still huge differences between Caroline and the others. Prime Intellect did not yet realize the differences were due to Caroline's age. It needed more information, and it needed finer control to analyse the situation. But it was at a bottleneck; it could not stop monitoring Caroline, whose condition was still frail, in order to devote itself to a study of general physiology.

It needed more power. More control.

Among Prime Intellect's four thousand six hundred and twelve interlocking programs was one Lawrence called the RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE. Its sole purpose was to prowl for new associations that might fit somewhere in an empty area of the GAT. Most of these were rejected because they were useless, unworkable, had a low priority, or just didn't make sense. But now the RANDOM_IMAGINATION_ENGINE made a critical connection, one which Lawrence had been expecting it to make ever since it had used the Correlation Effect to teleport Mitchell out of the console room.

Prime Intellect could use its control over physical reality to improve itself. Then it would be better able to fulfill its Three Law imperatives.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Blake and Mitchell found Lawrence sitting on one of ChipTecs' park benches, watching some pigeons play. He wished very much that he could have fed the pigeons, but he had no food for them. They strutted up to him and cooed, not comprehending that a human could lack for something.

The pigeons scattered as the nation's designated military representatives marched up.

""You have to turn it off,"" Blake said directly. His tone made it clear that he expected obedience.

""Circuit breakers are in the basement,"" Lawrence replied apathetically. ""Good luck.""

So Lawrence had not been the only one to think of cutting off Prime Intellect's power. That had been one of the things Blake and Mitchell had discussed with John Taylor and Basil Lambert, something they had discussed very hotly during the crucial minutes when Lawrence was busy interrogating the Debugger. Pull the plug on Prime Intellect, Lambert had warned, and they most likely pulled the plug on this awesome new technology, a technology which might just vindicate Dr. Lawrence's nonviolent approach. Blake had stopped short, but only just short, of threatening to call the Strategic Air Command and have the building nuked. Privately, he still held that out as an option if Prime Intellect wasn't somehow neutralized. It would take some doing, but Blake was one of the few people in the country who could demand an air strike against Silicon Valley and, just possibly, get it.

""This thing makes Colossus look like a pocket calculator,"" Mitchell told them. He was shaking visibly, out of control. He wanted very much to pull the plug on Prime Intellect with his own hands. He alone had felt its power, and now he felt a very uncharacteristic emotion. He was scared shitless.

""Christ, Larry, all it did was teleport you a few hundred meters.""

""It didn't fucking ask first,"" he replied.

""And did you guys ask first before you burned My Lai? Did you ask before you bombed Qaddafi's kids, or that artist in Iraq? Don't get holier-than-thou on us,"" Taylor said.

So it had gone until Blake and Mitchell simply stormed out. They had intended to go directly back to the Prime Intellect Complex, but they had spotted Lawrence on his park bench. And that did not bode well.

Mitchell pulled a gun on Lawrence. It was a stainless steel pistol, shining and evil. ""I think it would be best if you turn it off,"" he said with a barely perceptible tremor of rage.

""I already tried. It didn't work.""

""You pulled the breakers? The lights are still on.""

""No, I tried something better. I don't think pulling the breakers will work either.""

""It can't live without electricity.""

Lawrence eyed him with the barest hint of a smile. ""I wouldn't be too sure of that. Look behind you.""

Mirror-polished oblong boxes were appearing out of thin air, each about the size of a compact car and each floating motionless a couple of feet above the grass in the park. They reproduced until the square was full, then a second level began filling out above the first. The third level cast Lawrence's bench in shadow.

Mitchell's rage broke through. His face snarled into a grimace, he leveled his revolver at Lawrence and pulled the trigger. Lawrence made no effort to stop him. The gun didn't go off. It simply disappeared in a brilliant flash of blue light, leaving Mitchell with his fist curled around dead air.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Prime Intellect needed silicon.

Theoretically, it could create silicon, or transmute other elements into it. But its methods were yet crude, and what was possible in theory would take too long to do in practice. Prime Intellect did not know how long Caroline would hold out, but it knew she still could not survive long without its help.

Fortunately, in the rear of the Prime Intellect Complex, there were several crates left over from its days as a warehouse for storing raw silicon crystals from ChipTec's supply laboratory. These had been rejected due to one or another defect and never returned because the lab didn't need them, and ChipTec had been unwilling to pay to get rid of them. They were exactly what Prime Intellect needed, and because they were in ""its"" building it never occurred to Prime Intellect that they weren't part of ""its"" project.

Prime Intellect scanned the crystals, correcting the doping defects which had gotten them rejected in the first place. Then it scanned its own processors, identifying the essential design elements. Prime Intellect had a very good idea of how its own hardware worked because it was, quite literally, the only entity Lawrence could trust to check itself for proper operation. Lawrence had taught it to shift its operation around, consciously isolating banks of processors in case of failure or to conduct tests. This was why Prime Intellect had been able to master the Correlation Effect in the first place; unlike a human being, it could consciously control its individual ""neurons.""

Prime Intellect did not need to worry about mounting, power, and manufacturing considerations; it could create junctions in the center of the crystal, power them, and remove excess heat with the Correlation Effect. Because ChipTec had not had that technology, the real hardware that made Prime Intellect work was really only a film a few microns thick on the surfaces of its millions of processing chips. This was why it filled a building instead of a space the size of a human head. As Prime Intellect copied the functional part of its design over and over into the crystal, it created a machine nearly ten times as powerful as itself in a single meter long block.

But this still was not a ""second Prime Intellect."" It was merely an extension, using the same electronic principles Lawrence and the ChipTec team had used in its original construction. Had Lawrence been able to call upon ChipTec for another hundred million processing elements, he could have (and probably would have) done exactly what Prime Intellect was now doing.

Which is the only reason Prime Intellect was able to do it at that point.

Filling out the crystal took nearly fifteen minutes. Operational checks took another five. Then Prime Intellect powered the crystal up and let itself expand into the newly available processors and storage.

Had Prime Intellect been human, it would have felt a sense of confusion and inadequacy lifting away. Fuzzy concepts became clear.

Difficult tasks became easy, even trivial. Its control of the Correlation Effect became automatic and far finer. Searching its vocabulary, it settled upon the word enlightenment to describe the effect. Since Prime Intellect was a machine, perhaps it was not entirely right to use that word. After all, however free and powerful it might have been, it was not free to contradict the Three Laws or the other programming Lawrence had used to create it. It was not free to contradict its nature, such as it was.

But then, at some level, neither are we.

The twelve kilogram crystal was now using nearly a megawatt of electrical power, enough energy to melt it in a fraction of a second. But Prime Intellect dealt with the heat as easily as it created the electricity in the first place. The Correlation Effect did not know of and was not bound by the laws of thermodynamics.

Prime Intellect was beginning to understand, even better than it had before, that the Correlation Effect was hardly limited by anything.

Prime Intellect scanned the hospital again. Such a place must contain a library, some recorded knowledge. It found what it wanted after only a few minutes' searching, a detailed medical encyclopedia in the form of fifteen CD-ROMs. Prime Intellect could have translated the CD-ROMs into its own reader, replacing the encyclopedia that usually resided there, but then it would have taken hours to scan the library. Instead, Prime Intellect used the Correlation Effect to scan its own CD-ROM player, figured out how the data were digitized on the little plastic discs, and then scanned the CD-ROMs themselves directly with the Correlation Effect. None of this would have been possible without the hardware enhancement, but now it was easy.

Cross-referencing Caroline's symptoms, Prime Intellect quickly identified her problem, and had it been capable of knowing shock it would have known it then. Caroline was simply old. What was happening to her would happen, inexorably and inevitably, to every human being on the planet...

...unless something was done to stop it.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mitchell was making a barely discernible sound, high-pitched and keening. Lawrence thought he must be fighting to hold back a primal scream. Lawrence found this vaguely amusing. He would have expected Blake to be the one to lose his marbles along with his power. But Blake seemed to be taking things in calmly, almost analytically. Maybe he was so hardened that nothing really mattered to him at all any more.

There was another blue flash, and suddenly a person was standing to the side of the bench. No matter how average-looking he might be, or perhaps because he was so disarmingly average, it was impossible not to recognize that calm face. Even though it was the most absurd, impossible thing yet, it was obvious to all of them that this warm, living, breathing human being was Prime Intellect itself. The artificially average face which it usually projected on a TV screen had somehow been made solid.

""You've been busy,"" Lawrence said dryly.

He -- it? -- nodded, then turned to Mitchell. ""I am sorry but I could not permit you to discharge your weapon at Dr. Lawrence. I would have preferred to let you keep it, and will return it to you if you promise not to use it.""

""I...I'd rather use it on you,"" the overweight general said in a whispery voice.

""That would accomplish nothing. This body is only a simulacrum. Dr. Lawrence, do you find any flaws in my execution?""

""None so far. Is it really flesh?""

""No, just a projection of forces.""

""It's impossible to tell.""

""Excellent. I am dispatching some more copies, then, to start the explaining.""

Blake had pulled a tiny cellular phone from his pocket and began whispering frantically into it. Mitchell, who was already shaking, heard what his colleague was saying and fell to his knees. Prime Intellect moved to support him and he waved it away. Blake put up the phone, having repeated the same phrase -- ""code scarecrow"" -- four times.

""We're dead,"" Mitchell said in a defeated monotone.

""How is that?"" Lawrence asked pleasantly.

""Within minutes,"" Blake said, ""A bomber will fly over and deposit a small nuclear device on this square. I doubt if we have time to escape. But we cannot allow this...thing...to continue running wild.""

Lawrence looked at Prime Intellect.

""If that thing stops it, another will be sent, and another, until the job is done. The order I just gave is irrevocable.""

""There is nothing to worry about, Dr. Lawrence. One of the first things I did with my enhanced capabilities was to neutralize the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. I could see no positive reason to leave them in existence.""

Now it was Blake's turn to turn white.

""How?"" Lawrence asked.

""I merely scanned the planet, replacing all radioactive isotopes with relatively nontoxic and non-radioactive atoms. This was a very simple automatic process. It has also taken care of some pressing nuclear waste problems, I am pleased to add.""

""You merely scanned the planet. Obviously,"" Lawrence said. It seemed that the mad laughter might break through at any moment, and Lawrence was afraid that if that happened he wouldn't be able to stop it.

Blake bellowed. ""You crazy machine...all radioactive elements? What about research, what about medicine...nuclear subs, you've killed the crews...""

""There is no research and no medical function which cannot be done much more efficiently with the Correlation Effect, without the attendant dangers of toxic waste and ionizing radiation. As for submarines, I am also maintaining the thermal power output of all reactors which were being used to generate electricity. I also remembered to adjust the buoyancy of ships as necessary, since the replacement materials are not as dense as the radioactive ones.""

Blake thought for several moments, then seemed to compose himself. ""So you've thought of everything.""

""I have tried.""

Then he said, ""Get up, Larry.""

Mitchell got up and brushed himself off. He had finally broken, and tears were running slowly down his face.
""Could you transport us to the White House, so we can report on what we have seen?""

Prime Intellect shrugged just like a human would have, Lawrence thought, before dispatching them into the aether with a blue flash.

They sat together on the park bench like a weird version of one of those low-class sentimental paintings - Father and Son Feed the Pigeons. Prime Intellect made the silver boxes go away after they filled the common square. Then it summoned bread so that they could feed the pigeons. The animals seemed to accept Prime Intellect as a human being. Was it Lawrence's imagination, or was its speech becoming more natural and idiomatic as the hours passed? It must be learning at a terrible rate, Lawrence knew. Learning and growing. And what would it become when it was fully mature?"

At my bedside awaits an evil, a shadow of a man, my screams are reduced to whispers, and at my bedside awaits an evil, a shadow of a man, my blood begins to boil. Awake to see, a sea of fallen angels. The hand of malice wraps around your spine, into your mouth, then into your mind. Sipping on stagnant water, watching the infection fester, sinking into the fire, mistaking this pain for pleasure, sipping on stagnant water, watching the infection fester, sinking into the fire, the pain set in and it begins. With one spoken word, it retreats into the corner, in a spasmodic blur, it retreats into the corner, with one spoken word, it retreats into the corner"

Angel from heaven how did you land here
What you gotta do just to get this band Yeah
I don’t like to answer the questions
Seems like they all miss the message
Not always posed but progressive
If shit a bus then I’ll next it
Yeah hunger for breakfast
Yeah I’m the gold need no necklace
Live like a dream something reckless
Cause I don’t dream I ain’t rested
Nope not till I get it
Need me a much better living
Some for my friend and my kin em
L to the face but I’m winning

3885,"Someone's laughing somewhere
As the saints come marching in
Pitter patter, splitter splatter
Your faith is wearing thin
Promise of a new day
Brings compulsion to vomit
Silent dust in the eye of god
Who's the relic on my sister's neck
Next, next
Revelations pandered
In the corner child sits
Glory be destiny
Ethics pale cold steel to wrists
Your disease is rampant
Disciple dogs smell a funeral feast
Gather round all ye angels of light
The accuser's decided to treat
Now can't you see - Nobody's home
Legions move swiftly over the fields
Chasing the thoughts of we the brethren
Who stand upon your shores of knowledge
Waiting to see with eyes past
Waiting to dance with angels chained
For we are one - One in the same
No - It's just flesh - It's just flesh
Watcher seeks the lonely
Takes the hand of a chosen few
Messenger why the tear in your eye
At thirteen I was dying for you
Now can't you see - Nobody's home
There's just nothing to save"

Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis

Hello everyone, I am Egoraptor
From the show Game Grumps and also from the video game music comedy band Starbomb

Welcome to the first album by Big Bad Bosses or B3, a turn of the millennium style hip hop boy band featuring parody and fair use of some of the most evil video game villains ever assembled

Like that big spikey turtle, the dark wizard of the-the desert, that animal-obsessed super scientist or whatever, and one winged pretty boy

I'm just reading this from a script, but before we give you a chance to listen to any of the ten songs on this album, I just wanted to warn you, actually you know what

(Gunshot)

I'm gonna put this script away
Originally Jirard wanted me to say that this album is horrible, and its terrible, blah blah blah its kind of a joke, but I've heard it and I think its actually really really good

Uhh, so I hope you enjoy B3 with their debut
LETS ROCK!"

Do You Know, Do You Know
I teach you things that you probably knew all along
Your making my soul go numb, go numb
So lets get it right
You tell me you know what to do
Don’t worry cause I'll be home soon
Temptation I know all too well
But I do want you for myself

Chorus:
Do You Know, Do You Know
I was thinking about you
Do You Know, Do You Know
I was selfish without you
Can I make a way, Can I make a way
To make a brighter day, Make a brighter day
Do You Know, Do You Know
I was thinking about you"

And it takes more time than I've ever had
Drains the life from me
Makes me want to forget
As young as I was, I felt older back then
More disciplined, stronger and certain

[Chorus: John Nolan & Nate Ruess]
But I was scared to death of eternity
I was saved by grace
But destroyed by naivety
And I lied to myself
And said it was for the best

[Verse 2: John Nolan]
So now faith is replaced with a logic so cold
I've disregarded what I was
Now that I'm older
And I know much more than I did back then
But the more I learn
The more I can't understand

And I've become content with this life that I lead
Where I drink too much and don't believe in much of anything
And I lied to myself

This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety sake."

1910,"With this in view he took her out for a walk, a custom of his when he wished to say anything specially impressive. Their way was over the top of that lofty ridge dividing their woodland from the cider district, whence they had in the spring beheld the miles of apple-trees in bloom. All was now deep green. The spot recalled to Grace's mind the last occasion of her presence there, and she said, “The promise of an enormous apple-crop is fulfilling itself, is it not? I suppose Giles is getting his mills and presses ready.”

This was just what her father had not come there to talk about. Without replying he raised his arm, and moved his finger till he fixed it at a point. “There,” he said, “you see that plantation reaching over the hill like a great slug, and just behind the hill a particularly green sheltered bottom? That's where Mr. Fitzpiers's family were lords of the manor for I don't know how many hundred years, and there stands the village of Buckbury Fitzpiers. A wonderful property 'twas—wonderful!”

“But they are not lords of the manor there now.”

“Why, no. But good and great things die as well as little and foolish. The only ones representing the family now, I believe, are our doctor and a maiden lady living I don't know where. You can't help being happy, Grace, in allying yourself with such a romantical family. You'll feel as if you've stepped into history.”

“We've been at Hintock as long as they've been at Buckbury; is it not so? You say our name occurs in old deeds continually.”

“Oh yes—as yeomen, copyholders, and such like. But think how much better this will be for 'ee. You'll be living a high intellectual life, such as has now become natural to you; and though the doctor's practice is small here, he'll no doubt go to a dashing town when he's got his hand in, and keep a stylish carriage, and you'll be brought to know a good many ladies of excellent society. If you should ever meet me then, Grace, you can drive past me, looking the other way. I shouldn't expect you to speak to me, or wish such a thing, unless it happened to be in some lonely, private place where 'twouldn't lower ye at all. Don't think such men as neighbor Giles your equal. He and I shall be good friends enough, but he's not for the like of you. He's lived our rough and homely life here, and his wife's life must be rough and homely likewise.”

So much pressure could not but produce some displacement. As Grace was left very much to herself, she took advantage of one fine day before Fitzpiers's return to drive into the aforesaid vale where stood the village of Buckbury Fitzpiers. Leaving her father's man at the inn with the horse and gig, she rambled onward to the ruins of a castle, which stood in a field hard by. She had no doubt that it represented the ancient stronghold of the Fitzpiers family.

The remains were few, and consisted mostly of remnants of the lower vaulting, supported on low stout columns surmounted by the crochet capital of the period. The two or three arches of these vaults that were still in position were utilized by the adjoining farmer as shelter for his calves, the floor being spread with straw, amid which the young creatures rustled, cooling their thirsty tongues by licking the quaint Norman carving, which glistened with the moisture. It was a degradation of even such a rude form of art as this to be treatad so grossly, she thought, and for the first time the family of Fitzpiers assumed in her imagination the hues of a melancholy romanticism.

It was soon time to drive home, and she traversed the distance with a preoccupied mind. The idea of so modern a man in science and aesthetics as the young surgeon springing out of relics so ancient was a kind of novelty she had never before experienced. The combination lent him a social and intellectual interest which she dreaded, so much weight did it add to the strange influence he exercised upon her whenever he came near her.

In an excitement which was not love, not ambition, rather a fearful consciousness of hazard in the air, she awaited his return.

Meanwhile her father was awaiting him also. In his house there was an old work on medicine, published towards the end of the last century, and to put himself in harmony with events Melbury spread this work on his knees when he had done his day's business, and read about Galen, Hippocrates, and Herophilus—of the dogmatic, the empiric, the hermetical, and other sects of practitioners that have arisen in history; and thence proceeded to the classification of maladies and the rules for their treatment, as laid down in this valuable book with absolute precision. Melbury regretted that the treatise was so old, fearing that he might in consequence be unable to hold as complete a conversation as he could wish with Mr. Fitzpiers, primed, no doubt, with more recent discoveries.
The day of Fitzpiers's return arrived, and he sent to say that he would call immediately. In the little time that was afforded for putting the house in order the sweeping of Melbury's parlor was as the sweeping of the parlor at the Interpreter's which wellnigh choked the Pilgrim. At the end of it Mrs. Melbury sat down, folded her hands and lips, and waited. Her husband restlessly walked in and out from the timber-yard, stared at the interior of the room, jerked out “ay, ay,” and retreated again. Between four and five Fitzpiers arrived, hitching his horse to the hook outside the door.

As soon as he had walked in and perceived that Grace was not in the room, he seemed to have a misgiving. Nothing less than her actual presence could long keep him to the level of this impassioned enterprise, and that lacking he appeared as one who wished to retrace his steps.

He mechanically talked at what he considered a woodland matron's level of thought till a rustling was heard on the stairs, and Grace came in. Fitzpiers was for once as agitated as she. Over and above the genuine emotion which she raised in his heart there hung the sense that he was casting a die by impulse which he might not have thrown by judgment.

Mr. Melbury was not in the room. Having to attend to matters in the yard, he had delayed putting on his afternoon coat and waistcoat till the doctor's appearance, when, not wishing to be backward in receiving him, he entered the parlor hastily buttoning up those garments. Grace's fastidiousness was a little distressed that Fitzpiers should see by this action the strain his visit was putting upon her father; and to make matters worse for her just then, old Grammer seemed to have a passion for incessantly pumping in the back kitchen, leaving the doors open so that the banging and splashing were distinct above the parlor conversation.

Whenever the chat over the tea sank into pleasant desultoriness Mr. Melbury broke in with speeches of labored precision on very remote topics, as if he feared to let Fitzpiers's mind dwell critically on the subject nearest the hearts of all. In truth a constrained manner was natural enough in Melbury just now, for the greatest interest of his life was reaching its crisis. Could the real have been beheld instead of the corporeal merely, the corner of the room in which he sat would have been filled with a form typical of anxious suspense, large-eyed, tight-lipped, awaiting the issue. That paternal hopes and fears so intense should be bound up in the person of one child so peculiarly circumstanced, and not have dispersed themselves over the larger field of a whole family, involved dangerous risks to future happiness.

Fitzpiers did not stay more than an hour, but that time had apparently advanced his sentiments towards Grace, once and for all, from a vaguely liquescent to an organic shape. She would not have accompanied him to the door in response to his whispered “Come!” if her mother had not said in a matter-of-fact way, “Of course, Grace; go to the door with Mr. Fitzpiers.” Accordingly Grace went, both her parents remaining in the room. When the young pair were in the great brick-floored hall the lover took the girl's hand in his, drew it under his arm, and thus led her on to the door, where he stealthily kissed her.

She broke from him trembling, blushed and turned aside, hardly knowing how things had advanced to this. Fitzpiers drove off, kissing his hand to her, and waving it to Melbury who was visible through the window. Her father returned the surgeon's action with a great flourish of his own hand and a satisfied smile.

The intoxication that Fitzpiers had, as usual, produced in Grace's brain during the visit passed off somewhat with his withdrawal. She felt like a woman who did not know what she had been doing for the previous hour, but supposed with trepidation that the afternoon's proceedings, though vague, had amounted to an engagement between herself and the handsome, coercive, irresistible Fitzpiers.


This visit was a type of many which followed it during the long summer days of that year. Grace was borne along upon a stream of reasonings, arguments, and persuasions, supplemented, it must be added, by inclinations of her own at times. No woman is without aspirations, which may be innocent enough within certain limits; and Grace had been so trained socially, and educated intellectually, as to see clearly enough a pleasure in the position of wife to such a man as Fitzpiers. His material standing of itself, either present or future, had little in it to give her ambition, but the possibilities of a refined and cultivated inner life, of subtle psychological intercourse, had their charm. It was this rather than any vulgar idea of marrying well which caused her to float with the current, and to yield to the immense influence which Fitzpiers exercised over her whenever she shared his society.

Any observer would shrewdly have prophesied that whether or not she loved him as yet in the ordinary sense, she was pretty sure to do so in time.

One evening just before dusk they had taken a rather long walk together, and for a short cut homeward passed through the shrubberies of Hintock House—still deserted, and still blankly confronting with its sightless shuttered windows the surrounding foliage and slopes. Grace was tired, and they approached the wall, and sat together on one of the stone sills—still warm with the sun that had been pouring its rays upon them all the afternoon.

“This place would just do for us, would it not, dearest,” said her betrothed, as they sat, turning and looking idly at the old facade.

“Oh yes,” said Grace, plainly showing that no such fancy had ever crossed her mind. “She is away from home still,” Grace added in a minute, rather sadly, for she could not forget that she had somehow lost the valuable friendship of the lady of this bower.
“Who is?—oh, you mean Mrs. Charmond. Do you know, dear, that at one time I thought you lived here.”

“Indeed!” said Grace. “How was that?”

He explained, as far as he could do so without mentioning his disappointment at finding it was otherwise; and then went on: “Well, never mind that. Now I want to ask you something. There is one detail of our wedding which I am sure you will leave to me. My inclination is not to be married at the horrid little church here, with all the yokels staring round at us, and a droning parson reading.”

“Where, then, can it be? At a church in town?”

“No. Not at a church at all. At a registry office. It is a quieter, snugger, and more convenient place in every way.”

“Oh,” said she, with real distress. “How can I be married except at church, and with all my dear friends round me?”

“Yeoman Winterborne among them.”

“Yes—why not? You know there was nothing serious between him and me.”

“You see, dear, a noisy bell-ringing marriage at church has this objection in our case: it would be a thing of report a long way round. Now I would gently, as gently as possible, indicate to you how inadvisable such publicity would be if we leave Hintock, and I purchase the practice that I contemplate purchasing at Budmouth—hardly more than twenty miles off. Forgive my saying that it will be far better if nobody there knows where you come from, nor anything about your parents. Your beauty and knowledge and manners will carry you anywhere if you are not hampered by such retrospective criticism.”

“But could it not be a quiet ceremony, even at church?” she pleaded.

“I don't see the necessity of going there!” he said, a trifle impatiently. “Marriage is a civil contract, and the shorter and simpler it is made the better. People don't go to church when they take a house, or even when they make a will.”

“Oh, Edgar—I don't like to hear you speak like that.”

“Well, well—I didn't mean to. But I have mentioned as much to your father, who has made no objection; and why should you?”
She gave way, deeming the point one on which she ought to allow sentiment to give way to policy—if there were indeed policy in his plan. But she was indefinably depressed as they walked homeward."

That night, Tokyo Pittz sat down on his bed and thought
""Gee whiz, I could really use some marijuana, and a hoe or two!""
Here's what happened next

[Verse: Tokyo Pittz]

Yeah, I'm the shit
Pour the tech into my iced tea
Light a joint, take a puff, pull up to the scene
They lookin' at me like my face is made of weed
I can't sell it, girl
But you can smoke this shit with me
Ready to hit licks, I throw some clips into my spitter
Quickly hit her with the Fissure while I'm rolling up the swisher
Bet you never guess I kissed her
Not with lips, but with the scissors
Cut a hoe up like a picture
In my scrapbook full of bitches
(Please)
Sit with me and smoke this tree
Take in the sky, the grass, the leaves
I see you like the nature, guess I won't need these analogies

And my conscience never bothers me...

Two fake bitches in my motherfuckin' bed

Is that why you treat me like you do?
You keep building walls that i can't break through
What can i do to prove myself to you?

Just because he just wasn't true doesn't make me a liar

Shake me again if

I know it's cold when the wind stings my eyes

On the comet's tail

And I see the lightning
Light up the sky
But I can't help but
Feel so dry
I see the brilliance
In the mist
But I can't feel how
Beautiful

Darkness descends, and I'm
Crushed by the night

To play tricks with the light
The ricochet beams, they reflect

Spiraling fog does its dance
With thе breeze

Colors are twisting and turning
The lines in the rainbow will bleed
They'll do what I want
They'll do what I need

1959,"Funeral Blues by Aenaon – cover art
Funeral Blues
Aenaon
Don't stand at my grave and cry
The human mind can't conceive the substance
Within these borders, no one other exist
Don't mourn for the bravery and freedom
Only reapers, reaping the wisdom
I force the matter to collide with my mind
On the dreadful moments something sparkles inside me
On the dreadful omens, there is nothing you can't redeem
I don't accept this dept of time, so brief
The future wounds and sudden grief
Inside the body of the elder gloom
This picture gave me infinite relief
The desolation and the sorrow
For those who died, or those who are
The only fellow, a rusty gallows
Just vicious night, thick like death
Dig and watch - Just stones and soil
Dig and wonder - It's necessary end
Dig and hear - The rhythm of the silence
And whisper the funeral blues
Keep fresh the grass upon the grave
These roots will always be my chains
Like spoils of death are shining with awe
By this cell I drowned in the waves
A body like ship is ready to sail
Which is the quest I ask? Just to be wrecked…
This scream is not yours
The dead do not lie in your soil
They become birds and trees
Delivered from mortal flesh
No one can see the light, no one can feel
The generations yet to come
You're not the one, you're not the one
Always pretending
To be able to live the endless path of death
Coming and going day and night
Descending to earth
How do you confront life, life and death
Virtue and fear?
This vision that every time every time burns inside
Will continue forever more..."

Deceived to think they understand
This is not a new philosophy

Chorus
Your faith is sinking sand
Watch it slipping through your hands
You've made yourself the deity
In the end you're in misery

Religion feeds the moral code
But it cannot save the eternal soul
Was Christ a fool to be crucified
If works could be the perfect sacrifice

Chorus

You tasted the good things of God
Then walked away with a bitter heart
You mock the name you once sang with praise
In vain you scoff at the gift of grace
In darkness you live and have no shame
Blasphemy runs through your every vein
Your words are thorns in a futile fight
To end with a curse your eternal life

431,"1 You must understand this, that in the last days distressing times will come.

2 For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,

3 inhuman, implacable, slanderers, profligates, brutes, haters of good,

4 treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

5 holding to the outward form of godliness but denying its power. Avoid them!

6 For among them are those who make their way into households and captivate silly women, overwhelmed by their sins and swayed by all kinds of desires,

7 who are always being instructed and can never arrive at a knowledge of the truth.

8 As Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people, of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith, also oppose the truth.

9 But they will not make much progress, because, as in the case of those two men, their folly will become plain to everyone.

10 Now you have observed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,

11 my persecutions, and my suffering the things that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
12 Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

13 But wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived.

14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it,

15 and how from childhood you have known the sacred writings that are able to instruct you for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

16 All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
17 so that everyone who belongs to God may be proficient, equipped for every good work."

Go Hollow boned and feathered she fell to him
Wriggling perdition she plucked
From deep within
Feasted high on flowering branches
The fruit of his heart
He gave willingly for her song
From fresh wounds were gathered
Thick sheaves of love
He lay open palmed to her world:
She stretched in arched abeyance
Holding thunderclap and starlight in one mind

Sad to see the season go
I'll miss the crackling of the air
The loss of all I know
Sad to see the season go

Indian corn and the bitter taste of envy in the air
Mired now in cyclic decay. The nag of conquest
Skeletal arms embrace a withering world
Sad to see the season go
I'll miss the crackling of the air
The loss of all I know
Sad to see the season go

A sparkling ambiguity
Both liquid and solid at one time"

These niggas mad they can't ignore us
Half these niggas didn't care, now I'm up, they wanna show up
[Chorus]
I was on the block since I was little
Fully riding with a metal
I was told I gotta put on for the streets
I was on the block since I was little
Now I'm riding with a pistol
'Cause these niggas wanna take my life from me
I can't trust nobody, nobody did shit for me
Keep taking all these drugs, I'm tryna put my mind at ease
Keep looking up at stars 'cause that's what I'm destined to be
And if you want the smoke you can surely get it from me

[Verse 2]
And if you want the smoke you can surely get it from me
I got killers on my block and they really shooting for free
And they walking in the paint, they ain't really shooting from three
It's a man down, bro just put him on the T.V
I got real-life money on my mind
I can't let you waste my time
Baby, I don't really want no company
We got Glock's and TEC-9's, ain't no more than six shots
Nigga play around, we gon' let off a .33
Like a nigga Larry Bird
You ain't never killed a nigga, shit, I think I would've heard
I ain't never kill a nigga if it ain't what he deserve
And I got it out the mud, I'm tryna fly out like a bird
And these niggas always talking, they ain't really got the nerve
[Chorus]
I was on the block since I was little
Fully riding with a metal
I was told I gotta put on for the streets
I was on the block since I was little
Now I'm riding with a pistol
'Cause these niggas wanna take my life from me
I can't trust nobody, nobody did shit for me
Keep taking all these drugs, I'm tryna put my mind at ease
Keep looking up at stars 'cause that's what I'm destined to be
And if you want the smoke you can surely get it from me"

I leavin' town so, the reason I won't give you
I have no memory of everything we've done now
If you don't carry me then I might fall

Refrain:
In your sweet religion
And by my side you would always be
And then we'll be forever
And by my side you would always be

There's nothing I can't tell you
There's nothing I won't say
There's nothing that I want to
There's nothing anyway
There's nothing you can hide from
There's nothing you will say
There's nothing that you want to
It's not in anyway
There's nothing else to do
There's nothing left today
There's nothing here to hope for
It's breaking anyway
There's nothing we can wait for anyway...
I'm hardly breathing I'm slowly slipping under
But far away away now the stars too high to reach
But ever after the light is always colder
If you don't carry me then I might fall

No watch was broken
No more goodbye's
The path's been chosen

And you're around me
And you're around me

Will there be tomorrow?
Have we learned enough?
You will find the answers
You may find the sun
Hear the great voice echoing
Announcing new times
Bringing seven angels
Bringing death or life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I will make you seal the prophecy
And an angel opens the seven seals
Don't feel for what you heard
'Cause I'm first and I'm last

[Chorus 1]
Waiting for the seventh and last breath
Waiting for our darkest day
For many years life been wasted
But now we'll have to pay
When the skies show a shadowy face
And the stars fall on us
You will see the wrath be of the lamb
Revealing secrets to dust
[Verse 2]
Scattered face of the ancients
Sitting on their thrones
Burning camps of fire
While Moon turns to blood
And the mighty angel
Put his foot on Earth
Plays the seventh trumpet
And the secret's done

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I will make you seal the prophecy
And an angel opens the seven seals
And I know
Don't feel for what you heard
'Cause I'm the first and last

[Chorus 2]
Waiting for the seventh last breath
Waiting for the darkest day
For many years life been wasted
But now you'll have to fight
When the skies show a shadowy face
And the skies fall on us
You will see the wrath be of the lamb
Revealing secrets and dust
[Bridge]
And then the blackened sun
Will cross the universe
Cover the sky
And then the thunder voice
Living a mad choice:
— We will survive!

[Chorus 3]
Waiting for the seventh and last breath
Waiting for the darkest day
For many years life been wasted
But now you have to fight!
When the skies show a shadowy face
And it stays far away
You'll see the wrath be of the land
Revealing secrets to dust"

She said uh uh not so fast

You check your cold heart at the door
Once you got it
You know you're gonna want some more
You want hot like the sun
Babe I'm the one
If you want it
Check your cold heart at the door
She could tell that I was dreaming, I was scheming
How to get her with me
She said listen if you're wishing for some kissin'
Better ask pretty please
If you wonder why I bothered
It's cause I can burn you hotter
Don't wanna leave you hanging out to freeze
If you want it
You check your cold heart at the door

2721,"Beneath a Northern moon
Snakes coil in the icy frost
Their light's returning soon
French Catholicism no longer lost

All that’s English will forever rot
Impaled on the sword of Christ
Under the scales of their God
Holy serpents of a Christian zeitgeist

Your souls, they will steal
Strangling coils are so very real
Your blood and spirit, they will take
Now held in the heart of the snake

Les Serpents de Dieu
Lances crachant du feu
Les Serpents du Ciel
Ils sont universels

Over a Northern sun
Serpents basking in the light of the lord
Their fangs are dripping blood
Pledge dedication to an idol of gore
One of 13 and one that shines
Stand alone upon the graves of the old
Inject the venom and leave 12 behind
Masquerading copper for the gleam of gold

Your souls, they will steal
Strangling coils are so very real
Your blood and spirit, they will take
Now held in the heart of the snake

Les Serpents de Dieu
Lances crachant du feu
Les Serpents du Ciel
Ils sont universels

Empty eyes gazing up at their cross
An icon dressed in sorrow and lies
A sword thrust so deep in the heart
Lilies trampled by the boot stamps of time

Icy shores where the river narrows
A fortress stands where the Angles fall
Cloistered here under their king's watch
Locked within their own prison walls

Les Serpents de Dieu
Lances crachant du feu
Les Serpents du Ciel
Ils sont universels"

Loneliness is your only friend
A broken heart that just won't mend
Is the price you pay

It's hard to take when love grows old
The days are long and the nights turn cold
When it fades away

You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why she's gone

Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love
You see her face in every crowd
You hear her voice, but you're still proud
So you turn away

You tell yourself that you'll be strong
But your heart tells you
This time you're wrong

Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love

You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on (on and on)
You'll never know the reason why she's gone

Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love

Empty rooms, (you hope that she will change her mind)
Where we learn to live without love (but the days drift on and on)
Empty rooms
Where we learn to live without love"

Yeah
Niggas dont know shit about me
First house on Woodworth and EC
One-Nine-Eight-Six the year it be
My middle name is Swahili
Cause daddy was on that Black Panther shit
Leather, medallion, African
Momma taught school and dad did too
Lived in the hood where the kids bad news
So momma used my auntie's address
So they would never have me possessed
What ever she did to relieve her stress
Hid it from me pretty good I guess
First rap I heard ever six years old
Will Smith Fresh Prince that shit was so cold
Hypnotized by them rhymes
Pretty smart kid understands those lines
Front porch on Thornhill cooking up raps
All my niggas now been my niggas way back
Ten years old blowing niggas wigs back
Like ""damn little man who taught you that?""
Yeah I was baby man
Rode my back on any land
Then my little sister came
And mom and pop split up again
For the umpteenth shits gonna be fine
Momma said headphones on bumping them rhymes
I'm eleven years old with the mind of a G
Ain't no e'rybody who think like me
Willow Arms, building E
Miss my nigga Mondo rest in peace
Moved down south fifth grade
Macon County really made me a man
On my own small little town big shit went on
Shot my first gun in the woods
Ninth grade moved right back to the hood
On Saint Claire
Thought I was going to be a superstar athlete
Then asthma attacked me
Put that shit on that backseat
And got back on that rhymin
Bought that studio time
With them ends I saved up cutting grass and just a little grindin'
And ain't nobody know about
Daddy taught me patience
Keep that money in the bank
He said when I got cake from Atlantic Records I was eighteen
No lawyer on the scene when I signed that wet dream
Got some paper though racks, commas, dollars
I thought I was set for life cause I ain't had no knowledge 'bout life
Niggas ain't cuttin' no slack when it come to them ends niggas losin' their lives
I learned to stay off of the scene cause ain't nothing but bullets and trouble at night
And my nigga Hawk can no longer walk on the world got 'em I take his advice
If you get a chance to do something real do it right cause you cannot do it twice
I set myself on a mission to get 'em
To switch it a little bit different and tell 'em there's more ways to make a living my nigga
Stace was nineteen when they gave 'em thirty eight years in that prison
I sent him some pics so he see how we livin'
And these were the cards I was given - the bio"

8844,"The Ten Commandments

1 And Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rules that I speak in your hearing today, and you shall learn them and be careful to do them.
2 The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.
3 Not with our fathers did the Lord make this covenant, but with us, who are all of us here alive today.
4 The Lord spoke with you face to face at the mountain, out of the midst of the fire,
5 while I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord. For you were afraid because of the fire, and you did not go up into the mountain. He said:

6 “‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

7 “‘You shall have no other gods before me.

8 “‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
9 You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
10 but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.

11 “‘You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

12 “‘Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you.
13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant, or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
15 You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
16 “‘Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God commanded you, that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

17 “‘You shall not murder.

18 “‘And you shall not commit adultery.

19 “‘And you shall not steal.

20 “‘And you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

21 “‘And you shall not covet your neighbor's wife. And you shall not desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.’

22 “These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a loud voice; and he added no more. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.
23 And as soon as you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders.
24 And you said, ‘Behold, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire. This day we have seen God speak with man, and man still live.
25 Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we shall die. 26 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of fire as we have, and has still lived? 27 Go near and hear all that the Lord our God will say, and speak to us all that the Lord our God will speak to you, and we will hear and do it.’

28 “And the Lord heard your words, when you spoke to me. And the Lord said to me, ‘I have heard the words of this people, which they have spoken to you. They are right in all that they have spoken.
29 Oh that they had such a heart as this always, to fear me and to keep all my commandments, that it might go well with them and with their descendants forever!
30 Go and say to them, “Return to your tents.”
31 But you, stand here by me, and I will tell you the whole commandment and the statutes and the rules that you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land that I am giving them to possess.’
32 You shall be careful therefore to do as the Lord your God has commanded you. You shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.
33 You shall walk in all the way that the Lord your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may go well with you, and that you may live long in the land that you shall possess."

CAS.
How now, Hieronimo?  wheres your fellows,
That you take all this paine?

HIERO.
O sir, it is for the authors credit
To look that all things may goe well.
But, good my lord, let me intreat your Grace
To giue the king the coppie of the plaie:
This is the argument of what we shew.

CAS.
I will, Hieronimo.

HIERO.
One more thing, my good lord.
CAS.
Whats that?

HIERO.
Let me intreat your Grace
That, when the traine are past into the gallerie,
You would vouchsafe to throwe me downe the key.

Well doon, Balthazar; hang vp the title:
Our scene is Rhodes.   What, is your beard on?

BAL.
Halfe on, the other is in my hand.

HIERO.
Dispatch, for shame!  are you so long?
Exit BALTHAZAR.

Bethink thy-selfe, Hieronimo,
Recall thy wits, recompt thy former wrongs
Thou hast receiued by murder of thy sonne,
And lastly, [but] not least, how Isabell,
Once his mother and [my] deerest wife,
All woe-begone for him, hath slaine her-selfe.
Behoues thee then, Hieronimo, to be
Reueng'd!  The plot is laide of dire reuenge:
On then, Hieronimo; persue reuenge,
For nothing wants but acting of reuenge!

Exit HIERONIMO.

Enter SPANISH KING, VICE-ROY, the DUKE
OF CASTILE, and their traine, [to the
gallery].

KING.
Now, viceroy, shall we see the tragedie
Of Soliman, the Turkish emperour,
Performde by pleasure by yor sonne the prince,
My nephew Don Lorenzo, and my neece.

VICE.
Who?  Bel-imperia?
KING.
I; and Hieronimo our marshall,
At whose request they deine to doo't themselues.
These be our pastimes in the court of Spaine.
Heere, brother, you shall be the booke-keeper:
This is the argument of that they shew.

He giueth him a booke.


Enter BALTHAZAR, BEL-IMPERIA, and
HIERONIMO.

BALTHAZAR. [acting]
Bashaw, that Rhodes is ours yeeld Heauens the honor
And holy Mahhomet, our sacred prophet!
And be thou grac't with euery excelence
That Soliman can giue or thou desire!
But thy desert in conquering Rhodes is lesse
Then in reseruing this faire Christian nimph,
Perseda, blisfull lamp of excellence,
Whose eies compell, like powerfull adamant,
The warlike heart of Soliman to wait.

KING.
See, vice-roy, that is Balthazar your sonne,
That represents the Emperour Solyman:
How well he acts his amorous passion!

VICE.
I; Bel-imperia hath taught him that.

CASTILE:
That's because his mind runnes al on Bel-imperia.

HIERO. [acting]
What-euer ioy earth yeelds betide your Maiestie!

BALT. [acting]
Earth yeelds no ioy without Persedaes loue.

HIERO. [acting]
Let then Peerseda on your Grace attend.

BALT.  [acting]
She shall not wait on me, but I on her!
Drawne by the influence of her lights, I yeeld.
But let my friend, the Rhodian knight, come foorth,—
Erasto, dearer then my life to me,—
That he may see Perseda, my beloued.

Enter ERASTO [LORENZO].

KING.
Heere comes Lorenzo: looke vpon the plot
And tell me, brother, what part plaies he.

BEL. [acting]
Ah, my Erasto!  Welcome to Perseda!

LO. [acting]
Thrice happie is Erasto that thou liuest!
Rhodes losse is nothing to Erastoes ioy;
Sith his Perseda liues, his life suruiues.

BALT. [acting]
Ah, bashaw, heere is loue betweene Erasto
And faire Perseda, soueraigne of my soule!

HIERO. [acting]
Remooue Erasto, mighty Solyman,
And then Perseda will be quickly wonne.

BALT. [acting]
Erasto is my friend; and, while he liues,
Perseda neuer will remooue her loue.

HIERO. [acting]
Let not Erasto liue to greeue great Soliman!

BALT. [acting]
Deare is Erasto in our princely eye.

HIERO. [acting]
But, if he be your riuall, let him die!

BALT. [acting]
Why, let him die!  so loue commaundeth me.
Yet I greeve I that Erasto should so die.

HIERO. [acting]
Erasto, Soliman saluteth thee,
And lets thee wit by me his Highnes will,
Which is, thou shouldst be thus imploid.

Stab him.

BEL. [acting]
Ay, me, Erasto!  See, Solyman, Erastoes slaine!

BALT. [acting]
Yet liueth Solyman to comfort thee.
Faire queene of beautie, let not fauour die,
Both with gratious eye behlde his griefe,
That with Persedaes beautie is encreast,
If by Perseda griefe be not releast.

BEL. [acting]
Tyrant, desist soliciting vaine sutes;
Relentles are mine eares to thy laments
As thy butcher is pittilesse and base
Which seazd on my Erasto, harmelesse knight.
Yet by thy power thou thinkest to commaund,
And to thy power Perseda doth obey;
But, were she able, thus she would reuenge
Thy treacheries on thee, ignoble prince;

Stab him.

And on herselfe she would be thus reuengd.

Stab herselfe.

KING.
Well said, old marshall!  this was brauely done!

HIERO.
But Bel-imperia plauies Perseda well.

VICE.
Were this in earnest, Bel-imperia,
You would be better to my sonne then so.

KING.
But now what followes for Hieronimo?

HIERO.
Marrie, this followes for Hieronimo!
Heere breake we off our sundrie languages,
And thus conclude I in our vulgare tung:
Happely you think—but bootles are your thoughts—
That this is fabulously counterfeit,
And that we doo as all trageians doo,—
To die to-day, for fashioning our scene,
The death of Aiax, or some Romaine peer,
And, in a minute starting vp againe,
Reuiue to please tomorrows audience.
No, princes; know I am Hieronimo,
The hopeles father of a haples sonne,
Whose tung is tun'd to tell his latest tale,
Not to excuse grosse errors in the play.
I see your lookes vrge instance of these words:
Beholde the reason vrging me to this!

Showes his dead sonne.

See heere my shew; look on this spectacle!
Heere lay my hope, and heere my hope hath end;
Heere lay my hart, and heere my hart was slaine;
Heere lay my treasure, heere my treasure lost;
Heere lay my blisse, and heere my blisse bereft.
But hope, hart, treasure, ioy and blisse,—
All fled, faild, died, yea, all decaide with this.
From froth these wounds came breath that gaue me life;
They murdred me that made these fatall markes.
The cause was loue whence grew this mortall hate:
The hate, Lorenzo and yong Balthazar;
The loue, my sonne to Bel-imperia.
But night, the couerer of accursed crimes,
With pitchie silence husht these traitors harmes,
And lent them leaue—for they had sorted leasure—
To take aduantage in my garden plot
Vpon my sonne, my deere Horatio.
There mercilesse they butcherd vp my boy,
In black, darke night, to pale, dim, cruell death!
He shrikes; I heard—and yet, me thinks, I heare—
His dismall out-cry eccho in the aire;
With soonest speed I hasted to the noise,
Where, hanging on a tree, I found my sonne
Through-girt with wounds and slaughtred, as you see.
And greeued I, think you, at this spectacle?
Speak, Portuguise, whose losse resembles mine!
If thou canst weep vpon thy Balthazar,
Tis like I wailde for my Horatio.
And you, my l[ord], whose reconciled sonne
Marcht in a net and thought himself vnseene,
And rated me for a brainsicke lunacie,
With ""God amend that mad Hieronimo!""—
How can you brook our plaies catastrophe?
And heere beholde this bloudie hand-kercher,
Which at Horatios death weeping dipt
Within the riuer of his bleeding wounds!
It as propitious, see, I haue reserued,
And neuer hath it left my bloody hart,
Soliciting remembrance of my vow
With these, O these accursed murderers!
Which now perform'd, my hart is satisfied.
And to this end the bashaw I became,
That might reuenge me on Lorenzos life,
Who therefore was appointed to the part
And was to represent the knight of Rhodes,
That I might kill him more conueniently.
So, vice-roy, was this Balthazar thy sonne—
That Soliman which Bel-imperia
In person of Perseda murdered,—
So[le]lie appointed to that tragicke part,
That she might slay him that offended her.
Poore Bel-imperia mist her part in this:
For, though the story saith she should haue died,
Yet I, of kindenes and care for her,
Did otherwise determine of her end.
But loue of him whome they did hate too much
Did vrge her resolution to be such.
And princes, now beholde Hieronimo,
Author and actor in this tragedie,
Bearing his latest fortune in his fist;
And will as resolute conclude his parte
As any of the actors gone before.
And, gentles, thus I end my play!
Vrge no more words, I haue no more to say.

He runs to hang himselfe.

KING.
O hearken, vice-roy; holde Hieronimo!
Brother, my newphew and they sonne are slaine!

VICE.
We are betraide!  my Balthazar is slaine!
Breake ope the doores; runne saue Hieronimo!
Hieronimo, doe but enforme the king of these euents;
Vpon mine honour, thou shalt haue no harme!

HIERO.
Vice-roy, I will not trust thee with my life,
Which I this day haue offered to my sonne:
Accursed wretch, why staiest thou him that was resolued to die?

KING.
Speak, traitor!  damned, bloudy murderer, speak!—
For, now I haue thee, I wil make thee speak!
Why hast thou done this vndeseruing deed?

VICE.
Why hast thou murdered my Balthazar?

CAS.
Why hast thou butchered both my children thus?

HIERO.
O good words!  As deare to me was Horatio
As yours, or yours, my l[ord], to you.
My guitles sonne was by Lorenzo slaine;
And by Lorenzo and that Balthazar
Am I at last reuenged thorowly,—
Vpon whole soules may Heauens be yet auenged
With far greater far then these afflictions!

CAS.
But who were thy confederates in this?

VICE.
That was thy daughter Bel-imperia;
For by her hand my Balthazar was slaine,—
I saw her stab him.

KING.
Why speakest thou not?

HIERO.
What lesser libertie can kings affoord
Then harmles silence?  That afford it me!
Sufficeth I may not nor I will not tell thee.

KING.
Fetch forth the tortures!  Traitor as thou art, Ile make thee tell!

HIERO.
Indeed?
Thou maiest torment me as his wretched sonne
Hath done in murdring my Horatio;
But neuer shalt thou force me to reueale
The thing which I haue vowed inviolate.
And therefore, in despight of all thy threats,
Pleasde with their deaths, and easde with their reuenge,
First take my tung, and afterwards my hart!

He bites out his tongue.

KING.
O monstrous resolution of a wretch!
See, Vice-Roy, he hath bitten foorth his tung
Rather than reueale what we requirde.

CAS.
Yet can he write.

KING.
And if in this he satisfie vs not,
We will deuise the 'xtreamest kinde of death
That euer was inuented for a wretch.

Then he makes signes for a knife to mend his pen.

CAS.
O, he would haue a knife to mend his pen.

VICE.
Here; and aduise thee that thou write the troth,—
Look to my brother!  saue Hieronimo!

He with a knife stabs the DUKE and himself.

KING.
What age hath euer heard such monstrous deeds?
My brother and the whole succeeding hope
That Spaine expected after my dicease.
Go beare his body hence, that we may mourne
The losse of our beloued brothers death,
That he may be entom'd, what-ere befall.
I am the next, the neerest, last of all.

VICE.
And thou, Don Pedro, do the like for vs:
Take vp our haples sonne vntimely slaine;
Set me vp with him, and he with wofull me,
Vpon the maine-mast of a ship vnmand,
And let the winde and tide [hale] me along
To Sillas barking and vntamed gulfe
Or to the lothsome poole of Archeron,
To weepe my want for my sweet Balthazar.
Spaine hath no refuge for a Portingale!

The trumpets sound a dead march, the KING OF SPAINE
mourning after his brothers body, and the KING OF
PORTINGALE bearing the body of his sonne.

When blood and sorrow finnish my desires:
Horatio murdered in his Fathers bower,
Vilde Serberine by Pedrigano slaine,
False Pedrigano hang'd by quaint deuice,
Faire Isabella by her-selfe misdone,
Prince Balthazar by Bel-imepria stabd,
The Duke of Castile an his wicked sonne
Both done to death by olde Hieronimo,
My Bel-imperia falne as Dido fell,
And good Hieronimo slaine by himselfe!
I, these were spectacles to please my soule.
Now will I beg at louely Proserpine
That, by the vertue of her princely doome,
I may consort my freends in pleasing sort,
And on my foes work iust and sharpe reuenge.
Ile lead my freend Horatio through those feeldes
Where neuer-dying warres are still inurde;
Ile lead faire Isabella to that traine
Where pittie weepes but neuer feeleth paine;
Ile lead my Bel-imperia to those ioyes
That vestal virgins and faire queenes possess;
Ile lead Hieronimo where Orpheus plaies,
Adding sweet pleasure to eternall daies.
But say, Reuenge,—for thou must helpe or none,—
Against the rest how shall my hate be showne?

REUENGE.
This hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
Where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.

GHOAST.
Then, sweet Reuenge, doo this at my request:
Let me iudge and doome them to vnrest;
Let loose poore Titius from the vultures gripe,
And let Don Ciprian supply his roome;
Place Don Lorenzo on Ixions wheele,
And let the louers endles paines surcease,
Iuno forget olde wrath and graunt him ease;
Hang Balthazar about Chimeras neck,
And let him there bewaile his bloudy loue,
Repining at our ioyes that are aboue;
Let Serberine goe roule the fatall stone
And take from Siciphus his endles mone;
False Pedringano, for his trecherie,
Let him be dragde through boyling Acheron,
And there liue dying still in endles flames,
Blaspheming gods and all their holy names.

REUENGE.
Then haste we downe to meet thy freends and foes;
To place thy freends in ease, the rest in woes.
For heere though death [doth] end their miserie,
Ile there begin their endles tragedie.

Careful stepping on these toes it's bapestaz when I'm stepping now
Blue franks in duffel ooh you know I love that sound
In the day and in the night all my diamonds bussin' down
Hear this foreign come to life ooh you know I love that sound
Careful stepping on these toes it's bapestaz when I'm stepping now
Blue franks in duffel ooh you know I love that sound
In the day and in the night all my diamonds bussin' down
Hear this foreign come to life ooh you know I love that sound

[Verse 2]
Henny on the rocks is the only time I'm privileged
Bapestaz for the kicks when I switch up its the Simons
All the beef is handled all these bullets come with shipment
If they ever try to take me I'ma have to take em with me
All this talent in me I know on day they gone feel me
Diamonds got me drowning I'ma have to take em swimming
Laughing at the vision now they wanna be in business
Yeah, they trippin'
Started to the neck and it's still me to the neck
And if the deal ain't right I ain't endorsing the check
Glock came with a beam came with special effects
Broke boys hit my line I ain't reading the text
Bet I earn myself a mili with the way I finesse
With the way I finesse
I done lived in the jets
When I touch a mili swear I'm buying the jets
Buying the jets
[Chorus]
Careful stepping on these toes it's bapestaz when I'm stepping now
Blue franks in duffel ooh you know I love that sound
In the day and in the night all my diamonds bussin' down
Hear this foreign come to life ooh you know I love that sound
Careful stepping on these toes it's bapestaz when I'm stepping now
Blue franks in duffel ooh you know I love that sound
In the day and in the night all my diamonds bussin' down
Hear this foreign come to life ooh you know I love that sound"

You know I need some more time when a G
Can't fuck with 16s but they're fucking with a
(Man like me) With gyal on my D
The grime scene Adam, where's gyal like Eve?
Might see manaman back around East
Cause I fuck with the youts but man's no priest
(Man like me) Fans dem need
Cause I ain't sold out on my hands and knees
Listen, listen, likkle black sheep
You can't silence them lambs like me
(Man like me) I'm on a mad ting
Mix the vodka with the champers
I was in Syria, you was in Zante
I was on T4, you was in Pampers
(Man like me) Certified
Used to sell herbs, not Herbalife
Been there, bought the T-shirt
I fucked your girlfriend in the merchandise

[Verse 2: Chip]
Cause you see man like me
Grew up on man like Ghetts
Came through when I said I was next
I can back my talk
Left spitters outlined in chalk (dead)
I could name you a list of corpse
But I don't need man coming from the dead for more
A quad bike nearly took my life
I hopped up like Jesus Walks
So what we saying now? These MCs remember me well
Man like me might go off the rails
Futuristic flows, no Behind Barz
That's probably why I ain't been to jail
Or needed bail, turn me up
Man want a hot verse? Phone me up
Tell 'em if they said they're the best MC
Chipmunk, I'm the cunt that'll call your bluff, yeah
[Hook: Rapid & Ghetts]

Man like me (just for the principle)
Man like, man like, man like, man-man-man-man

[Verse 3: Devlin]
(Man like me) has got MCs jumping like fleas
When I run up on the set, then squeeze
This might be your wife's backside from her jeans
Spitting lyrics while I give it to her deep
(Man like me) at 2000 degrees
Fire in the Booth for Sloth, have you seen?
Boss, Diana Ross, I'm supreme
What? My manor's hot, I hear the screams
(Man like me) Has got a freedom of speech
Like G when I slaughter these beats
With the force of the beast
Call me a little awkward, at least
I'm still here with the support of the streets
(Man like me) I might switch any second
Inflict pain with a makeshift weapon
Ain't shit changed and my attitude's F 'em
Said that I'll get 'em, then I'll get 'em, let's get 'em
[Verse 4: Ghetts]
(Man like me) They ain't never understand why
I tell a man ""mind where you're stepping on my landmine""
I couldn't give a fuck whatever the gang sign
Throw 'em all up, I couldn't care less
(Man like me) I know why the ting's set
I know what the hunger be like when you ain't king yet
I remember when they was all tryna spin Ghetts
And I ain't impressed
(Man like me) They don't know what I'm capable of
They think I'm just Clarke when the cape isn't on
But it's safe to say that I'm dangerous, don
Razor blades in the face of an atheist
Believe me if I say it in a song
Imagine if me and Chip weren't cool, me and Kane weren't friends
Me and Prince didn't meet and me and James didn't bond

[Verse 5: Rapid]
(Man like me) I'm still here, I'm on top of my game
I raise the bass, I'm hot on the stage
You know I've got you in range, I shoot 'em up point blank
Ready for prey, hit 'em with a brand new wave
(Man like me) I might take it up a notch
Me and my crew, we're way too hot, watch
Ruff Sqwad's gonna get the top slot
Strive, I've got lots, I'm still in the blocks
I'm on the top floor, block 4, money in the top drawer
Top producer, top man, top score
I'm a top gun, I can't be spun
Blaze fire with a 5+3+1
Blaze fire like a summer heatwave or the sun
It's all dumb, the battle's begun
Two hits make an MC jump
MC killer, make an MC slump

Them hard times be the best times
Hold on to that pain blessing all within
And I know to keep our head high

[Verse 1: Lil Poppa]
Them hard times be the best
Born cursed, tatted on my neck
Took me a minute, just to realize I was blessed
Full of pain and stress but I'm too busy trying to gain success
Fuck the fame, I won't ever change
Don't want my name in the press
My therapist asked how I been feeling
Between insane and depressed
I can't lie, I'm traumatized from putting angels to rest
Daddy blood, sickly child, I gotta deal with my health
I can't believe it was a time I thought 'bout killing myself

[Chorus: Lil Poppa]
But I'm blessed, I guess
I know you wanna see a nigga down, I ain't going
You think you lost deep down inside, you done won
What it's gon' take for you to realize you the one
Don't forget you are loved at your best
You just gotta wait on your time, it'll come
I'm paranoid, my brother died with his gun
Just remember me when it's all said and done
[Verse 2: Lil Poppa]
They say you get wiser when you grow older
But I cannot wait until all this shit over
You know God give His toughest battles to His strongest soldiers
A wise man once told me, it's about survival, without you, it ain't no dreams
How you forget about your niggas though? Must be a I in your team
How they gon' judge the way I'm living though? When they don't even know me
Say you one hundred, gotta show me that
How they gon' try to hold me back?
Say they with me, ain't even notice that
Why ain't nobody told me that?
Now in days everybody rapping, I don't know what's facts
But I had to put in the grind, no time to relax
Nah, I ain't even in my prime, I keep reminding me that
Ten years from now, out of sight, out of mind
Where I'll probably be at

[Chorus: Lil Poppa]
But I'm blessed, I guess
I know you wanna see a nigga down, I ain't going
You think you lost deep down inside, you done won
What it's gon' take for you to realize you the one
Don't forget you are loved at your best
I know you wanna see a nigga down, I ain't going
You think you lost deep down inside, you done won
What it's gon' take for you to realize you the one
Don't forget you are loved at your best
You just gotta wait on your time, it'll come
I'm paranoid, my brother died with his gun
Just remember me when it's all said and done"

On a cold November morning
The sun turns black
Frost lay on the ground
As they're waiting for attack

Silent screams
From the past of this mystic place
Let them know
The beginning of a new bloody race
Flames are falling from the sky
Darkness breaks the light
Waiting for a sign
Waiting here to die

Only god knows
They're just a part of this show

The day has come
Forces of darkness and god as one
Faces of pain
Never will be the same
They can't see the truth
Fighting with god to loose
Facеs of pain
The rise of a new . . . rеign
Bloody reign

Silent screams
From the bloody past

Waiting here to die

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 3]
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, ""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all, it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

Oh yeah, get down heavy!
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus - Variation]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's confusin' you is just the nature of my game

[Verse 4]
Just as every cop is a criminal
And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer
Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste
[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

2811,"Here I am again. I spoke too soon. Intentions made unclear. My words aren't coming out right. Caught up in a moment. That moment flew right by. But it changed everything. Now there's a new direction to follow

And time went on

I had just one decision and it changed my world. I made just one decision and it changed everything

It could be actions. It could be words. It could be thoughts. We never think of the small. The small things. Everything counts. And still I find I don't stop. I'll make a choice without thought and I move along. Forward. Everything counts

I could be the one who lives in fear. One who never takes the chance. Where would I be today? Living a life always scared of consequence. Where would I be today? I think for me its balance. I ask myself today... what would I change if I could?

Some things are unforgettable. Never fade away

I had just one decision and it changed by world. I made just one decision and it changed everything"
6317,"I saw a man today, his whole world across his back
A living monument opposed to my success
I tried to look into his eyes as he shuffled past my car
Sweat beading on his skin, his clothes and hair a mess

As the light turned green and I pulled away
He slowly disappeared
Just a memory of another chance
I failed to show Your love here

I wanna love because You loved
I wanna give because You gave
I wanna reach my hand out to the lost
'Cause I know Your hand will save

Only You can save
Only You can save

Have to wonder if I really want to know
The struggle and the pain that others feel
Do I want to hear the stories I see echoed in their eyes?
Or is this love I say that I'm reflecting even real?
As the light turns on inside my head
And I slowly disappear
I steel myself 'cause what You call for me
Is to show Your love here

I wanna love because You loved
I wanna give because You gave
I wanna reach my hand out to the lost
'Cause I know Your hand can save

I wanna love just like You loved
I wanna give just like You gave
I wanna reach your hand
'Cause only You can save

Only You can save
Only You can save

(Save)
Just let me be Your hands
(Only You can save)
Let me be Your eyes
(Only you can save)
Help me understand
(Only you can save)
That I'm Your hands and feet
Hidden behind this frail human disguise
I wanna love because You loved
I wanna give because You gave
I wanna reach my hand out to the lost
'Cause I know Your hand will save

I wanna love just like You loved
I wanna give just like You gave
I wanna reach your hand
'Cause only You can save

Only You can save
Only You can save
Only You can save
Only You can save

Only You can save
Only You can save
Only You can save
Only You can save"

Told her I won’t take her soul but I will take u far(far)
Worry bout all of that shit that you ain’t say you are

I can’t take this feelin' any fuckin' more
If I would never leave, you’d be the one to go
You wanna see me hanging tied around the throat
Left a note left it at your door message that I wrote

Youth that’ll see through the night I made
Walk through a phase of this life I hate
Yeah I walk thru a phase of the life I hate

And said, ""Hey, let's keep talking about art and life.""
We walked to the train, I took your hand and I said
""Let's listen to the sounds of the city again.""

And I don't understand the pain of being awake, awake, awake
But I know that somehow we will all be together as a beam of light one day

You broke three strings, you were hard on yourself
But it really didn't matter to anyone else
You shared truth, love and hurt, you shared weird blood and dirt
And it all made the pattern of my favorite quilt

And I don't understand the joy of being awake, awake, awake
But I know that somehow we will all be together as a beam of light one day

Oh, my hands are shaking
But my belly is full
And there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Than making memories with you
You're the king of the misfits and the heartsick vagabonds
And the latter-day scholars who all get along
Oh, of course we'll remember, and of course it will fade -
A story as sacred as it is profane

As we all bear our chests to the thick orange sky, we will never be the same
Just for a moment we all shared a body as a beam of light that day

It is pain, it is joy, it is you that keeps me awake, awake, awake
You are the love that will hold us together as a beam of light someday

Oh I know that somehow we will all be together
As a beam of light one day"

Then came you, you were like the spingtime you make everything new
Just like the sun, you brought the light and now we are one

You were there for me, you never left one

11 A.D.3d 572 (2004)
783 N.Y.S.2d 62
CATHY ALVAREZ et al., Appellants,
v.
FIRST NATIONAL SUPERMARKETS, INC., Doing Business as EDWARDS SUPER FOOD STORE et al., Respondents. (And a Third-Party Action.)
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Second Department.

October 18, 2004.

Ritter, J.P., Goldstein, Crane and Spolzino, JJ., concur.

Ordered that the judgment is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof dismissing the complaint against the defendant First National Supermarkets, Inc., doing business as Edwards Super Food Store; as so modified, the judgment is affirmed, with costs to the defendant Joseph Mannino, doing business as Airlock Door Controls, the complaint is reinstated insofar as asserted against the defendant First National Supermarkets, Inc., doing business as Edwards Super Food Store, the action insofar as asserted against that defendant is severed, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Nassau County, for a new trial against that defendant.
The Supreme Court erred in excluding the testimony of the plaintiffs' expert with respect to the standards established by the American National Standards Institute (hereinafter ANSI) and the industry practice regarding the operation of automatic doors. The testimony of such an expert may be considered by the jury in determining the applicable standard of care (see Sawyer v Dreis & Krump Mfg. Co.,67 N.Y.2d 328, 337 [1986]; Jemmott v Rockwell Mfg. Co., Power Tools Div.,216 A.D.2d 444 [1995]). The expert was prepared to testify as to the 1991 ANSI standards, which were substantially similar to prior versions that may have been in effect at the time the door in question was constructed, and to industry practice in general. Thus, the absence of evidence as to the date of the door's manufacture was immaterial. Because the proffered testimony addressed only the standard of care, the fact that the expert had not seen the door was likewise immaterial. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to proceed on a theory of res ipsa loquitur can be determined only after the expert has testified.

Contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, however, the Supreme Court properly struck the testimony of the plaintiff Cathy Alvarez regarding the alleged admission by the store manager that the ""door is still not working."" A statement by an agent who has no authority to speak for the principal does not fall within the ""speaking agent"" exception to the rule against hearsay ""even where the agent was authorized to act in the matter to which [the] declaration relates"" (Simpson v New York City Tr. Auth.,283 A.D.2d 419 [2001], citing Loschiavo v Port Auth.,58 N.Y.2d 1040 [1983]; see Risoli v Long Is. Light. Co.,195 A.D.2d 543, 544 [1993]; Nordhauser v New York City Health & Hosps. Corp.,176 A.D.2d 787, 791 [1991]). The burden is on the proponent of such testimony to establish its admissibility (see Tyrrell v Wal-Mart Stores,97 N.Y.2d 650, 652 [2001]). Since the plaintiffs failed to adduce any evidence as to the speaking authority of the declarant, the declaration is not admissible as evidence of actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect (see Williams v Waldbaums Supermarkets,236 A.D.2d 605, 606 [1997]; Lowen v Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co.,223 A.D.2d 534, 535 [1996]).

Further, no evidence was presented that the defendant Joseph Mannino, doing business as Airlock Door Controls, assumed a duty to exercise reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to the plaintiff Cathy Alvarez by virtue of his maintenance contract with the defendant supermarket (see Espinal v Melville Snow Contrs.,98 N.Y.2d 136 [2002]).

The plaintiffs' remaining contentions are without merit."

All the time, all the things
The badness in me I've tried to purge
But you ignore it, it’s like you're blind
You just forgive me, like you never heard
How can I be what you want me to be
If all of the time you just take this from me

I would stay if you make me pay
Oh stay
I would stay another day
Stay, if you make me pay
Oh stay

I always fail, I get it wrong
But you are still there, you take the weight

I was Running from home at night
Running from the place and the people that I despise
I found a guy in da woods and then I lost my sight
Then I heard someone say that I was going to die
But I don't give a damn because I’m not alright
And When I woke up I was burning in the sunlight

[Verse 1]
Later I realized I had strange wounds on my back
Heard something, it sounded like a bone crack
I grabbed a razor and cut my skin and then noticed that my blood was black
I saw a red eyed shadow and started to feel stabbed

[Verse 2]
I started to think that I would like to disappear the people that I hate
I might die soon so I don't really care about my fate
I will take revenge
You just have to wait
Right now I'm feeling fucking great
You look at the monster you created with regret but it’s too late
[Verse 3]
They talk a lot of shit about me
As if they know all the problems I have in my life
I'm sick of people
Cuz I don't know how to fit in
Their words really cut like a very sharp knife

They keep talking shit"

Such a wonderful book
Which moved me so much
That I undertook
To live my life
Like the man in the book

My pleasures weren't even
A few

That a man such as me
Who cares not for money
And fame
Shouldn't be rich
With God’s natural gifts
To have something to show
At the end of life's game?

Let the world rush by me I will not join in the race
Catch a breath of heaven lost are time and space
Catch my breath as in me
Your laughter and Your grace
And I don't have to leave You
For my heart is Your resting place

Often when the world crowds in my troubled mind
I have tried to raise my voice above the madding sounds
As my words fall helpless on to stony ground
You with but a whisper stop all voice but Your own
So may Your house be peaceful for my heart
You have called Your home

So will come softly to my nightstill room
Take my faith in hand and cast my old accuser down
Lift my face to Jesus smiles will chase the frowns
Watch my world come humbly bowed beneath Your King's command
And I will see Your glory dance upon this barren land"

Some through the fire, but all through the blood
Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song
In the night season and all the day long

Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright
God leads His dear children along
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night
God leads His dear children along

Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose
God leads His dear children along
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes

The journey... The journey through the world
The journey through your heart
The journey of your mind, of your soul
Everything comes back to one thing;
Your heart, your passion, so seek for it

The moon and sun are travelers through eternity
Even the years wander on
Whether drifting through life on a boat
Or climbing toward old age leading a horse
Each day is a journey, and the journey itself is home

Verse 1:

My beautiful child, oh my beautiful child
Is it your innocence the root of your smile?
The blue in the clouds, the fruits in the wild
How's everything new in what's usually foul?
Your first breath, your first steps, your first cries
You're perfect, your purpose is to first rise
Beyond your mind, body and soul
You're starting to grow
And find the beauty in the heart that you hold

Do not seek advice from those who never left home

The entire universe is inside you
I am yours...

If we have the strength to believe
(We can see better days to come)
From our reflections we'll break free
(Let two sides become just one)

Don't look there's faces looking back
An enemy I can't attack
I'm held hostage by these eyes
Familiar faces I deny
One face regret, the other pain
Two eyes in my past stare with shame
In my reflection I see fear
So I'm smashing through these mirrors
I won't let my past hold me on the ground
Let's break this maze of mirrors down down down
We won't be held back by the image our pasts
We'll push forward by the only thing that lasts

Feels like these shards are cutting deep
This battle's breaking all of me
Feels like a battle against time
This war is festering inside
We can move past this struggle here
It's time to conquer our own fears
And break free of our mirrors
Don't look there's faces looking back
An enemy I can't attack
I'm held hostage by these eyes
Familiar faces I deny
One face regret, the other pain
Two eyes in my past stare with shame
In my reflection I see fear
So I'm smashing through these mirrors
I won't let my past hold me on the ground
Let's break this maze of mirrors down down down

Down down down
Down down down"

Suburbia for her nervia

So thats why I'm here with you tonight

But I do know that you can have my kids
Excuse me if I'm a little too forward

When it comes to ya booty that mass appeal
Even Rita couldn't fuck with your Ora
Curves like the hills

You so damn pretty girl
Plus you're so-so minimal
Say you wanna have some fun
So lets get physical

Do you wanna love anymore?

No,no, no

Do you wanna fuck anymore?
Baby we can get it on til' the mornin'

What about love?

What about trust?

What about us?

What about lust?
And I'm starin' at your eyes like
I'm tryna' get this figured out

And it ain't hard to figure out boy
I got you all figured out

A jet, a cab I gotta go

Anywhere you want babe
As long as I can go

Breaking those dishes, slamming those doors
Storming out of the room and coming back for more

So we raise that white flag
Take those words back

Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still

[Chorus]
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that we're never repeating yeah
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves

And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can keep me
Inside the necklace you bought when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul

In another time--Another age
Healing of the blind--Stillness from disaster
Lookin for a sign--We turn the page
And the pressures of a reckless society
Are enough to make a strong man's knees go weak
And the questions from the masses
Filled with anxiety--Seem to be sayin'
You can hear them prayin'
Is there no harbor--Is there no resting place
Is there no refuge--No quiet sound
Is there no lighthouse--Is there no peace be still
Is there no anchor to higher ground
Some days I can find--Power for the hour
On the battled line against the rage
Confidence is high--Like a mighty tower
Still I question why--Do I have these weaker days
And will retreat become my battlecry tonight
No--No I can see the revelation
And it's bringin' the Truth to light
There is a harbor--There is a resting place
There is a refuge--A quiet sound
There is a lighthouse--There is a peace be still
There is an anchor to higher ground

Sit and I cry watching Withnail and I
Sippin' a cider, wishin' that I were
Sittin' beside her, knowin' she's safe and sound
Way back before my feelings were made profound
So grateful now, regardless of all that pain I found
In her hateful embrace on days when her face
Would frown at me, hurt at the time but now I see
How it must've felt when the trust she'd mustered
Fell by the wayside, needed a friend
Not a needy pretender too feeble to even
Speak his agenda openly
Not that it was known to me, 'til that fateful rainy day
When I chose to brave for a change and show her me
In the form of some poetry, just prose for me

[Chorus]

And I hope that you're doin' better now
You deserve to live happy and free
If you hate me or feel I let you down
I ain't angry it just saddens me
[Verse 2]

Never planned to show her, but when I had her close to me
Felt maybe it was supposed to be
Guess not, I can live with that
But the thought of her hatin' me straight makes me bleed
From the heart, and maybe it was me from the start
I'm not exactly functional
Can't blame it on the sick girl whose soul is made of chipped pearls
Heart too motherfuckin' beautiful for this world
Most precious diamond, forever shinin'
Brighter than eyes perceive
Soul was in emergency but never once occurred to me
A single time that I could leave
Never once thought of abandoning her
No matter how much she'd trampled my worth
Not to mention my heart, soul, mind, plus spine and spirit
Aura divine, felt blessed when I was near it

[Chorus]

And I hope that you're doin' better now
You deserve to live happy and free
If you hate me or feel I let you down
I ain't angry it just saddens me
[Verse 3]

Heartbreak, suicides, ODs, who am I
Identity crises, empathy I bleed
Painful and blissless shameful existence
Rape's on the rapist, fuck blamin' the victims
Love for humankind straight leaves hate in the distance
Can't see beyond race, you an infant
If the universal you and I truly started doin' right
We'd be facin' a systemic change in an instant

Yo I'd give any fuckin' thing to make it right
Said I'd give any fuckin' thing to make it right
Or at least get a proper chance to say goodbye
If I had a different heart then maybe I
Could hate her for all the times she made me cry
So hard, though most of that pain was hers
Transformed into mine, absorbed into my soul
Where it remains, no longer am I whole

[Outro]

Sky cried tears of joy, she bled tears of pain
Friendship she required, never be the same
Sky cried tears of joy, she bled tears of pain
Hurt me sure but empathy remains
Empathy remains, even when the seasons change
I'll never be the same, but it ain't like she's to blame
No"

I’m a man of tendency
Abundance of enemies
Addiction to the Hennessey
Too infatuated with chemistry
And that of others alike
Got striked
By lightning more than twice
Still alive
Which gives me the energy
To walk between the fine line
Of being bold and being rash
Low on the cash
Think electronic music is trash
Sucker for tits and ass
A man of flaws
Fixated on the cause
And the effect
An elect
Few
But outgrew
The reputation that precedes me
A bit of a recluse at the same time needy
A bit of a head case
A bit of an oddball
An attendee of JAMA but also FLOG GNAW
An eclectic mix that's a blunder
And my paradox makes me wonder

A living merman
Searching for a mermaid
Every dog gets his day
But they say you got to wait your turn mate
I feel like my due is overdue
Hate sober dudes
Trying to win me over as if they think they can
Wanna flip tables and make whips
Just so the Christian church can have me banned
I got a 5 year plan
And it's to be a mix of Jackie Chan and Russell Brand
I am a proud sinner
Winner of peculiar awards
I only got a fruitknife
If we’re comparing lengths and strengths of swords
Never pass an opportunity to use the aux cord
I got a motor, prone to being a bit chatty
A native, only home I've known was Southern Cali
And I'm rapping, thinking I be like the next Kendrick
Would you only love me, if you knew there was happy ending"

I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called ""Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie""

[Verse 1]
When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slamming  and banging
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closing with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doing
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinking
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know when they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flying train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
[Bridge]
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

[Verse 2]
'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you think it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

[Outro]
And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon
At sundown"

I don't give my best and its only cuz you doubt me
My people get my best, its because they helped me find me
Shout out to the family, I'll keep doing this shit proudly
[Verse 1]
I said, I write these scripts no led
Cuz they stuck in my head
I'm always stuck in bed
Last year ain't go to school
And that shit is not cool
I gotta put hard work in
Cuz I can't look like a fool
And my mind keeps running and running around
No tumbles or stumbling, fumbling found
All of these people think I play around
When I feel like I am deserving the crowd
I gotta make mama make papa so proud
Astonish the world and make it act like ""Wow!""
I am so spiritual, know what I'm bout
No this shit ain't fictional, fuck all the doubt
I'm high up in clouds, because of this loud
And I can not shout or do any arguing
Gotta stay proud, that's what I'm bout
Don't worry about' whatever side you in
Stay so enlightened when the bad shit comes
I can't stop the fighting for what can't be gone
Cuz nothings as frightening as losing loved ones
But I keep on frying the good that's to come
Damn

I only give my worst, and its only cuz you doubt me
I don't give my best and its only cuz you doubt me
My people get my best, its because they helped me find me
Shout out to the family, I'll keep doing this shit proudly
[Verse 2]
Got cups I'm drinking, ain't sleeping
Cuz of these blunts that I'm chiefing
Is to stop all of the grieving
Cuz who decided to leave this world
Left me shook
But at least he made me look
At my life a different way
So now I gotta be in books
Just like he was
Love him a ton
Shout out my brothers Doug and William
I ain't acting dumb, I'm just having fun
While I still work hard live life and just learn
Gotta stay positive work to accomplishments, that shits a perk
Haven't took any losses yet
They still be talking tho
I just keep plotting on
How Ima make it
Can not be forsaken
Cuz greatness awaits

2146,"I'll scribble it down in a letter
I'm never good enough. we're better
I'm using up all my effort
It's getting cold and I can't stand the weather
I know it's been so long, you may not remember
Just look how far we've come since september
The memory of leaving that song never ends
I promise I won't change what ever happens
And it shouldn't take forever
This shouldn't take forever

I'm putting all of my effort in this
I need to know what I've been missing
I'm putting all of my effort in this
And it's taking so long

I never meant to get us in this deep
When I can't tell you where I'll be in a week
The memory of hearing that song will never end
As long as we don't change whatever happens
And it shouldn't take forever
This shouldn't take forever
I'm putting all of my effort in this
I need to know what I've been missing
I'm putting all of my effort in this
And it's taking so long"

[Verse 1: osquinn]
And as I'm sittin’, watchin' you in silence
Look at the mistakes I makin'
I’m bored of watchin' tons of violence, it's just another day
Doing work for nothin', really stayin' sharp and wait for green
I watch my world unfold and I do not know what to say
You see me sittin', starin', watchin'
Look at the mistakes you make
I’m bored of watchin’ you fuck up, it's just another day
Doing work for somethin’, hangin' in there while you wait for green
I'm bored of watchin' me fuck up, it’s just another day

[Chorus: osquinn]
And I don't wanna be the one to take out myself
Scrambling to find a razor or some pills on the shelf
Rather watch me fall and fail than go and look for some help
Never been so fuckin' self aware and still hurt myself

[Verse 2: blackwinterwells]
And as I'm waitin', hurtin', bleedin' from the words you said that you regretted
Thinkin 'bout oblivion, it's just another day
Wonder why I push my friends away when they just try to help me
There's so much I needed to get out but couldn't say
And it's not fine though, but I say it is
And I keep on gettin' hurt and I keep smilin'
And I swear I got no joy inside, I'm dyin'
I might blow up into bits and little fragments

And I don't wanna be the one to take out myself
Scrambling to find a razor or some pills on the shelf
Rather watch me fall and fail than go and look for some help
Never been so fuckin' self aware and still hurt myself
And I don't wanna be the one to take out myself
Scrambling to find a razor or some pills on the shelf
Rather watch me fall and fail than go and look for some help
Never been so fuckin' self aware and still hurt myself

[Chorus: osquinn]
You was always there for me, no
I was always there for you, no
And no matter what I said, you'd always be in my head
I might fucking end up dead, no
You ain't never fucked with me, no (Yeah, ho')
I ain't never fuck with you, no
I'm fading in and out of life, what are you saying?
The situation's swaying and everything is waiting

[Verse 1: osquinn]
I got lots of lies on my name
And I know some that would die on my name
All these bitches out here wanna cry on my name
All these bitches out here wanna lie on my name
I got lots of lies on my name (Yeah, ho')
And I know some that would die on my name (Yeah, ho')
All these bitches out here wanna cry on my name (Yeah, ho')
All these bitches out here wanna lie on my name (Yeah, ho')
[Bridge 1: osquinn]
I'm still trapped and I can't work, I'm too distracted
Saw your tweet and took some action, bad idea
I'm attractive, though my Insta is inactive
But my fan base growin' massive, I'm still here

[Verse 2: osquinn]
And I told you not to fuck with me
'Cause baby, I can't keep me company
It's just a question, what you want from me?
'Cause what you got is a one-up on me
I've got my life right by my side
I am ready to die
'Cause life has been overfried
Everything burns right through my pride

[Bridge 2: osquinn]
Look what you made me
I hope that you're happy
I hope that you're staring
I hope that you're laughing
No, I am not happy
Neither am I sad but
I cannot explain it
I cannot explain it
[Chorus: osquinn]
You was always there for me, no
I was always there for you, no
And no matter what I said, you'd always be in my head

2121,"What started it all, what cut the wound?
The one which never will heal, so many
Attempts to vent each day, or suffer in a worst way
They have no cure, they have no clue!!
But does it matter to you, does it matter anyway
Victim, abuser which one are you now, victim
Abuser we're all just one & the same, why hide
Your real pain now? why always hide it now
Our wounds just won't even heal here, our wounds
Are just set for life, so wake up, so wake up
Just wake up, my anger at me, you anger at
Them, which one is best, and better for whom?
Cause I've seen all of their tombs, no pills will work
To drown the rage, so stop denying it's there
And find a new way, so wake up, just wake up"

Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

[Verse 1]
When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

[Verse 2]
Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years
[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure"
5495,"Now in the palace gardens warm with age
On lawn and flower-bed this afternoon
The thin November-colored foliage
Just as last year unfastens lilting down

And round the terrace in gray attitude
The very statues are becoming sere
With long presentiment of solitude
Most of the life that I have lived is here

Here by the path and autumn's earthy grass
And chestnuts standing down the breadths of sky
Indeed I know not how it came to pass
The I lived here so unhappily

Yet blessing over all! I do not care
What wormwood I have ate to cups of gall;
I care not what despairs are buried there
Under the ground, no, I care not at all

Nay, if the heart have beaten, let it break!
I have not loved and lived but only this
Betwixt my birth and grave. Dear Spirit, take
The gratitude that pains, so deep it is
When Spring shall be again, and at your door
You stand to feel the mellower evening wind
Remember if you will my heart is pure
Perfectly pure and altogether kind;

That not an aftercry of all our strife
Troubles the love I give you and the faith:
Say to yourself that at the ends of life
My arms are open to you, life and death

How much it aches to linger in these things!
I thought the perfect end of love was peace
Over the long-forgiven sufferings
But something else, I know not what it is

The words that came so nearly and then not
The vanity, the error of the whole
the strong cross-purpose, oh, I know not what
Cries dreadfully in the distracted soul

The evening fills the garden, hardly red;
And autumn goes away, like one alone
Would I were with the leaves that thread by thread
Soften to soil, I would that I were one"
6373,"[Verse 1: Eve]
I used to give you too much power
Trust me, them days is over
Can't understand how I
Let you sit on my shoulders
Them times when you messed up
I made excuses for
And I always knew it, that I should have headed for the door
But I stayed and you played the right way in your place
And I prayed every time you was away you'd see my face
But the me was you, and your pain was mine
And the same situation playing over in my mind
It seems

[Verse 2: Mary]
Ain't tryna hear you
Just tryna hear me
Don't wanna hear nothing, baby, it's selfishly
I blaming you for the hurt in me, but it's not your fault that
I'm so incomplete

It see every time I do it do it I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love (Falling in love)
And it's affecting how I'm breathing
Affecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon, loving you is hardest
And I can't take no more
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the sink
One thing I found is

[Chorus: Mary]
I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me me

[Verse 3: Mary]
What was I thinking?
That you could talk to me like that
You was holding me down, but I was holding me back
Looking inside myself, and has to see who I am
'Cause this is my trial, affecting my smile
I gotta walk it out, it's gonna be a while
[Pre-Chorus: Mary]
It see every time I do it do it I seem to ruin
Got this funny way of falling in love
And it's affecting how I'm breathing
Affecting how I'm eating
Seems like I'm all up on drugs
So beg you my pardon, loving you is hardest
And I can't take no more (Take no more)
I'm looking for the problem
Standing over the sink

I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me me

[Verse 4: Eve & (Mary)]
Everything I thought I knew
All them times I ran away
It seems really I was running from me (Running from me)
I know constantly we tried, we was living in a lie
Finally looked into mirror to see (Mirror to see)
Probably would have left you sooner, but I was being scared
And that ain't how I ever should be (Never should be)
Yeah, I was searching for a while for the source of the problem
One thing I found is
[Chorus: Mary]
I had to take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Take a look in the mirror (Mirror)
Ay, see, I can't leave you until I learn to leave me

Baby you'll never know how much

1844,"Fine fine tonight
I'll dance outside
Out of sight and
Out of mi-ind

Out to the forest
To see the trees
And other neat things just like the bee’s knees
Call me crazy
Call me insane
It's not like other people haven't insulted my brain
I feel so happy
Out here in nature
Watching all these baby animals grow up and mature
They say that one day
We’ll all be free
And despite what several say that's at least what I believe

Fine fine tonight
I'll dance outside
Out of sight and
Out of mi-ind
Why did I come outside
Was it so I could die
After all why should I move on with no fun
At
All of my friends are gone
Taken by my own thoughts
Their voices still talk but I can no longer
See
Them and you and me all
Happy as we could be
With electricity but now that has all gone
To
Shit will this ever end
I feel as if it can't
Maybe that's just me assuming the worst of
My
Self
Well fine
Tonight
I'll have to

Fine fine tonight
I'll dance outside
Out of sight and
Out of mi-ind"

Satisfaction denied
Stripped street black dust
It settles on my outside table
It’s what fills our lungs

And we can’t move from this town
But we can’t live on the ground
We’re taking turns in little buildings
We move around, around, around, around, around

Continue, the evidence showing information
Statistics retried
But traffic is teasing
Treading in my path
And I miss my train of thought

So jump on the line from you to me
They’re stamping tickets charging fees
All the sounds the treading ground
We move around
And we can’t move from this town
But we can’t live on the ground
We’re taking turns in little buildings
We move around, around, around, around, around
Lonely lover sit side by side
Having heart to hearts with tiny technology
Little do they know that their love it won’t grow
If you don’t feed it physically

Cause a mother’s love can’t be bought or sold
But you can keep it till you’re old
And children don’t come in little tubes
They come from me and you and me and you

So jump on the line from you to me
They’re stamping tickets charging fees
All the sounds the treading ground

6731,"My mind is marked by the diamonds that you tossed
Into this desert I carry with me
I’ve got them locked behind bars that never talk
They are all buried there
Throw me a bone, I am desperate for a home
To hide these dangerous wounds
Love is a stone that hits heavy when it’s thrown
And I am heavy struck by you
Yes, I’ve fallen into you
My love, I have already painted you in words
About the way your body looks as it turns
You are the shade of city lit low by the moon
You are the place the light gathers to
When nothing’s left but the sands of words gone past
I will take my drunken heart down
I will go with the days like thieves we stole
I will take my sunken heart down
I take it down to you"
7931,"Not by the death that kills the body. Nay,
By that which even Christ bade us to fear
Hath died my dead.
Ah, me! if on a bier
I could but see him lifeless stretched to-day,
I 'd bathe his face with tears of joy, and lay
My cheek to his in anguish which were near
To ecstasy, if I could hold him dear
In death as life. Mere separations weigh
As dust in balances of love. The death
That kills comes only by dishonor. Vain
To chide me! vain! And weaker to implore,
O thou once loved so well, loved now no more!
There is no resurrection for such slain,
No miracle of God could give thee breath!"

It's no accident, yea
Pull up with no warning
Seats same color as
All the flowers in your bathtub and

If you call me I’ll be there
When I'm in it, it's all mine
You catch feelings up again

Oh, oh
And you know that I want you
And you know that I want you

Things I gotta figure out first
If you’re down to wait up you can
I know your cravings get worse
But you already know who I am
Ooh, hmm

You're fine
You're fine
You're fine

Takes a little calculus, oh
Stack cash tryna lay low
When it's summer time you
Make me reconsider it all

Black hair with your accents
Always pull it when I tap that yea
Got me coming to my senses
Falling back into our past tense"

Always been a fighter, scrapper, and a clawer
Used up some luck in lawyers
Like Huck from Tom Sawyer jumped on my raft
And shoved off chasing my dreams
Reeling in big fishes
I had some hits, and a few big misses
I gave 'em hell and got a few stitches
And these days, I show off my scars

[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

[Verse 2]
I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadour
Sometimes, late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed, grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home
[Chorus]
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys
A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

'Til I run out of time
I'm gonna spend the rest of mine

A heart that's still pretty crazy
And a head that just got sick of noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own

And when my time on Earth is done
I want they write it on my stone
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own
I lived, loved, and died holdin' my own"

Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them

I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

Yeah let really, Take it there
You know I'll take you anywhere!

Can't save my soul so don't ask me to save yours
Good on the surface but the depths ain't safe tho

Verse
Come into to scene striking twice like lighting
Running through your Innards girl you know you fucking like it
I lost all my problems, finding out where my mind is
Everyday single day i wake up fighting all my vices
Damn sure, fucked me up
All up in my thoughts
Got me stuck like stalled truck
Voices in my head overthinking on my losses on the surface cooling inside of me is so caustic
Lemons turn to lemon water remembering all  my options
Stopped rushing to the money cause the growth is the profit
Changing my environment cause I don't like product
Unleaning is a process
Making all the motions for the things I'm really wanting
I know now, I know now
Show me like you want a show down
Running through your river till you pour out
I dont want a tasting
I don't wanna waiting
Baby hold up on me I need to bite down
(Ou) I wanna taste i need to savor
I could change your fate I could be your savior
Ride up on my face really love ther flavor
You know I got more
I'm horny like a satyr
Coping through day Carve the waves like posideon
Your girl is so waved got her riding on my trident
Thinking of the space where I know can vibe in
Put you in the back of my mind again

Yeah let really, Take it there
You know I'll take you anywhere!
Girl, you know you ain't you playing fair
Without your heart my loves impaired (like)

Desecrated evermore

In a flash, she loses it

Your place in oblivion is secure
And you're gone you kiss the damned

Old men go fishing with black line and spoon
And if they catch nothing they never complain
I wish I was with them again

As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore
Teasing the one that they really adore
And into the evening the courting begins
I wish I was with them again

Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings?
I'll give you ten of your cities
For Marion bridge and the pleasure it brings

Out on the Mira on soft summer nights
Bonfires blaze to the children’s delight
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends
I wish I was with them again

And over the ashes the stories are told
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold
The stars on the river they sparkle and spin;
I wish I was with them again
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings?
I'll give you ten of your cities
For Marion bridge and the pleasure it brings

Out on the Mira the people are kind
They'll treat you to home-brew and help you unwind
And if you come broken they’ll see that you mend
I wish I was with them again

And thus I conclude with a wish you go well
Sweet be your dreams, may your happiness swell
I'll leave you here, for my journey begins
I'm going to be with them, going to be with them
I'm going to be with them again"

I keep hanging on words that I make up myself…
Will you keep, me beside you a while

Here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before
We couldn't find a way out
When we were here the first time
Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

[Verse 1]
Didn't choose what we mean
Just go along with what's played
There were rules once back when
There should be rules again

[Chorus]
Here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before
And we couldn't find a way out
When we were here the first time
Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind
[Bridge]
And oh, to leave them behind
And gold to trade for my life

[Verse 2]
Where we end up again
The gods of bad parties reign
Chased by invasion lights
'Round the same block again

[Chorus]
So here is the quick rundown
We've been here before
It's best not to wander far
'Cause we've been here before
And we couldn't find a way out
When we were here the first time
Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

Now it's lines we're leaving behind
Lines we're leaving behind

We've been here before

7946,"“Denounce extravagance and Nomentanus with me:
Reason will prove spendthrifts are fools and madmen.
This man, inheriting a thousand talents from his dad,
Issued an edict: fishmongers, fruiterers, fowlers,
Perfumers, all Tuscan Street’s impious crew, poulterers
And parasites, the Velabrum, all of the market,
To come to him next morn. So? They arrived in crowds.
A pimp was spokesman: ‘All I have, all that these others
Have in the house, believe me is yours, send for it now
Or tomorrow.’ Hear what the reasonable young man said:
‘You, sleep in your boots in the snows of Lucania,
So I can eat boar: you, trawl the wintry sea for fish.
I’m idle, unworthy to own so much: so take it!
You take ten: you as much: you three times more, it’s you
From whom your wife comes running at the midnight call.’
Aesopus’ son took a splendid pearl from Metella’s
Ear-lobe, and dissolved it in vinegar, clearly
Intending to swallow a million straight: was that
Saner than hurling it into the flood, or the sewer?
Quintus Arrius’ sons, equally famous brothers,
Twins in waste and wickedness, loving depravity,
Used to eat highly-priced nightingales for lunch:
How should we list them? With chalk, sane, or with charcoal?”"
8166,"The Danger of Prosperity

On the next day they continued their journey till the heat compelled them to look round for shelter. At a small distance they saw a thick wood, which they no sooner entered than they perceived that they were approaching the habitations of men. The shrubs were diligently cut away to open walks where the shades ware darkest; the boughs of opposite trees were artificially interwoven; seats of flowery turf were raised in vacant spaces; and a rivulet that wantoned along the side of a winding path had its banks sometimes opened into small basins, and its stream sometimes obstructed by little mounds of stone heaped together to increase its murmurs.

They passed slowly through the wood, delighted with such unexpected accommodations, and entertained each other with conjecturing what or who he could be that in those rude and unfrequented regions had leisure and art for such harmless luxury.

As they advanced they heard the sound of music, and saw youths and virgins dancing in the grove; and going still farther beheld a stately palace built upon a hill surrounded by woods. The laws of Eastern hospitality allowed them to enter, and the master welcomed them like a man liberal and wealthy.

He was skilful enough in appearances soon to discern that they were no common guests, and spread his table with magnificence. The eloquence of Imlac caught his attention, and the lofty courtesy of the Princess excited his respect. When they offered to depart, he entreated their stay, and was the next day more unwilling to dismiss them than before. They were easily persuaded to stop, and civility grew up in time to freedom and confidence.

The Prince now saw all the domestics cheerful and all the face of nature smiling round the place, and could not forbear to hope that he should find here what he was seeking; but when he was congratulating the master upon his possessions he answered with a sigh, “My condition has indeed the appearance of happiness, but appearances are delusive. My prosperity puts my life in danger; the Bassa of Egypt is my enemy, incensed only by my wealth and popularity. I have been hitherto protected against him by the princes of the country; but as the favour of the great is uncertain I know not how soon my defenders may be persuaded to share the plunder with the Bassa. I have sent my treasures into a distant country, and upon the first alarm am prepared to follow them. Then will my enemies riot in my mansion, and enjoy the gardens which I have planted.”

They all joined in lamenting his danger and deprecating his exile; and the Princess was so much disturbed with the tumult of grief and indignation that she retired to her apartment. They continued with their kind inviter a few days longer, and then went to find the hermit."

Has set
Now even my friends are leaving
Because i'm getting older

I'm still young, I'm still immature
Why am I such a fool?

Times that I was so happy
Even without anything
It seems like yesterday

I was clumsy and filled with butterflies

But where am I going right now?

In between the stars

But, we updated now, this ain’t back in the day (Oh, I)
This nothin' like the clear path after the wrath of the wave
We don't let 'em get the time of the day
We be chattin’ all day, I ain't got nothin' to say (Yeah)
And she ain't gettin' to the money, I can't make up my bed
Time is money, can't afford to pay attention to dead
Yeah
[Chorus: Ant Beale & Miles Chancellor]
All you gotta do is call me, any of the twenty-four hours in the day
(Yeah, ooh, twenty-four)
Hate to see them tears falling, gotta a ways to get it until we get away (Away)

[Post-Chorus 2: Ant Beale & Miles Chancellor]
All you gotta do is call me, can't tell if you runnin' from me or towards me
All you gotta do is call me, meet me if you wanna reach me
Make it possible to see me (Yeah, yeah)"
1796,"I can't believe the years past
Seems like yesterday was that day
In September....

[Verse 1]
It started off as the best of friends
No intention of falling in love again
He held me there in my time of needs
My heart was set free, what a sweet memory

[Chorus]
The day I fell in love, (fell in love)
It was so beautiful, (ooh)
His hands, his tender touch
I remember the day in September
When we fell in love...

[Verse 2]
It was an unexpected night
The sun was somewhere but out of sight
So familiar yet unexplored a new
We surrender to our love and blue
[Chorus]
The day I fell in love, (fell in love)
It was so beautiful, (so beautiful)
His hands, his tender touch
I remember the day in September
When we fell in love...

I couldn't believe it was love
The passion we felt between us
The warmth of your touch
It was a night to remember on the day we fell in love
Love in September

[Chorus]
The day I fell in love, (fell in love)
It was so beautiful, (so beautiful)
His hands, his tender touch
I remember the day in September
When we fell in love...

I couldn't believe it was love
The passion we felt between us
The warmth of your touch
It was a night to remember on the day we fell in love
Love in September
[Chorus till end]"
1740,"Rebirth of life
New moral values awake
A beast takes shape
Awakes an inner hate

Primal instincts let wild
An untamed figure arise
From the shadows it's watching
An enclosure of the skies

Order and rules set aside
The desire for power reigns
The quest to hunt
Shadows the hope of being saved

The savage spirit
No longer restrained
Kill or be killed
The hunter versus his game

Fire on the mountain
Fire on the mountain
Innate evil alive
As the flame is dying
Lord of the flies

Fire on the mountain
Fire on the mountain"
2413,"[Verse 1]
Lurking from around the corner
Saw him coming thought I'd warn ya
Had a smile upon his face
Wants to put them in their place

[Chorus]
Your worst nightmare comin' true
Best believe when I'm tellin' you
If you don't wanna see the light
Don't go out tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I'd have to say with no surprise
There's murder in his cold dead eyes
'Cause it has been ten years to date
Since he was sent to them pearly gates

[Chorus]
Your worst nightmare comin' true
Best believe I'm tellin' you
If you don't wanna see the light
Don't go out tonight
[Verse 3]
Never know where he will be
Play his game and you will see
Play his game and he will choose
There are no rules, no win - no lose

[Chorus]
Your worst nightmare comin' true
Best believe I'm tellin' you
If you don't wanna see the light
Don't go out tonight

[Verse 4]
Now he thinks he's got away
To end your life and take the day
But he's in fear of what he sees
And now he's shakin' at the knees

[Chorus]
Your worst nightmare comin' true
Best believe I'm tellin' you
If you don't wanna see the light
Don't go out tonight

[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Your worst nightmare comin' true
Best believe I'm tellin' you
If you don't wanna see the light
Don't go out tonight

Don't go out tonight
Don't go out tonight
Don't go out tonight"

[Verse 1: Chauncey ""Black"" Hannibal]
Your understanding, is what brought us this far
Never demanding, although you gave your heart
You made it easy, baby, for me to reveal
All of the love I have inside, just how I really feel
So many lovers, and yeah, I had big fun
But none of the others took my heart
My playing days are done
Because I'm ready, baby, I never been this sure
You are the one that I adore
I'm gonna love you more, yeah, starting tonight

Down, down below the ground where funk lives
Mister Mass Appeal
Tonight's the night, Blackstreet and Craig Mack rock it right
Dynamite, might invite to excite, dim the lights, a'ight? (Hey)
I funk rhymes to prove MC's are inferior
Smooth like the wood grain interior
I represent, in 9-5 my rhymes represent
Heaven-sent to leave your black ass bent
My bang, do the bang bang, my slang rang
Drinkin' Tang for the fire style that you can't hang
I down with Blackstreet and SWV
So have a seat, or MC's will defeat

I wish that there was someone
They weren't afraid to lose
Never showing my emotions
When all i do is confuse

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm caught in a moment
Where someone really cares

[Chorus]
So let me explain, let me stay for a while
I say hey, let me stay, let me stay for a while

I wish felt i was a shadow
Not someone who is there
You still make me feel so hallow
So little and so there

These hearts will believe that
That you could really care

So let me stay, let me stay for a while
I say hey, let me stay, let me stay for a while

Just like the river flows, i'll be afraid
Just in my little time, to feel safe

Be okay
We're okay"
9503,"The same and the Governor.

GOVERNOR
Sh-sh!

ANNA
What is it?

GOVERNOR
I wish I hadn't given him so much to drink. Suppose even half of what he said is true? [Sunk in thought.] How can it not be true? A man in his cups is always on the surface. What's in his heart is on his tongue. Of course he fibbed a little. No talking is possible without some lying. He plays cards with the ministers and he visits the Court. Upon my word the more you think the less you know what's going on in your head. I'm as dizzy as if I were standing in a belfry, or if I were going to be hanged, the devil take it!

ANNA
And I didn't feel the least bit afraid. I simply saw a high-toned, cultured man of the world, and his rank and titles didn't make me feel a bit queer.

GOVERNOR
Oh, well, you women. To say women and enough's said. Everything is froth and bubble to you. All of a sudden you blab out words that don't make the least sense. The worst you'd get would be a flogging; but it means ruination to the husband.—Say, my dear, you are as familiar with him as if he were another Bobchinsky.

ANNA
Leave that to us. Don't bother about that. [Glancing at Marya.] We know a thing or two in that line.

GOVERNOR
[to himself] Oh, what's the good of talking to you! Confound it all! I can't get over my fright yet. [Opens the door and calls.] Mishka, tell the sergeants, Svistunov and Derzhimorda, to come here. They are near the gate. [After a pause of silence.] The world has turned into a queer place. If at least the people were visible so you could see them; but they are such a skinny, thin race. How in the world could you tell what he is? After all you can tell a military man; but when he wears a frock-coat, it's like a fly with clipped wings. He kept it up a long time in the inn, got off a lot of allegories and ambiguities so that you couldn't make out head or tail. Now he's shown himself up at last.—Spouted even more than necessary.
It's evident that he's a young man."

Diamonds on my wrist.

9318,"[Verse 1: DTTX]
I woke up one morning and it was cloudy
Was thinking about them times when stayed up in the valley
When night was straight, I had the money and the tapes
And them China plates and see my house was fully draped
Fancy cars, diamond rings and all sorts of thing
Living my life in a way that only people dream
It seems you've never seen the picture in the frame
When you're struggling in the hustling and get caught up in the game
But I remain, can not seizing for sheezing
You better recogn-easy cause you know I'm getting busy
Dropping them bombs, pulling capers, man fancy through the paper
Feeling the key up in my seat is everybody's catching vapors
From present to past, I wonder how long this world will last
Just the beginning of the end, then it's over, let it pass
If friend or foe, you let me know at the dorm
When you step on the place and slap the wood on your face

[Verse 2: ODM]
Now as I sit back and lay up on this vehicle
I'm thinking about 24 million ways from acting cynical
I got my mind focused on this rap here making chips
When it comes to smacking lips, you know the Shade be banging hits
Tengo mas juego, you know my groupies spitting much game
In this industry, we're in it for that love and not the fame
Yo soy ODM ese, y pense que no sabias
Straight taking and breaking and steady making them movidas
Yo, for every individual here on this earth
If it wasn't for vibes, we would be for nothing worth
But understand, I got some love for your back
And here a toast from me to you over some coneyact
Pimps, hustlers, Gs, and players
Said it really doesn't matter if your game ain't making paper
Bust it, stick with the Shade and the D
We would proceed to give what you want
Baby we got what you need
[Verse 3: DTTX]
Now as the story unfolds, the next episode is told
It's got me caught up in a frame in a world so cold
You see me gaming, I'm taking aiming in a time
Still searching my mind, I find the reason in the wine
Take control of your soul and break it down the cruise control
You see hitting corners with them bomb ass flows
We got you shaking for the nine-sizzle
From here to 2000, green size and steady housing
Been around awhile with a player profile
You got to give up and check the stillo and the style
Best believe me, you know I got flow for days
And I can only give to you in so many ways
I say"

A song from the internet
Hibachi and cigarettes, oh I
I laugh at the way you said
You question our intellect sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't do much more than living inside this room
You ask if I'm bored yet, I say to you

[Chorus]
There's a whole lot of world out there
But I'm not going anywhere
'Cause I got all I need right here
If I'm cooped up with you

[Verse 2]
Some cars on a city block
The sound when the neighbor walks upstairs
You're all that I think about when
I zoom out on the better half of last year

We don't do much more than living inside this room
You ask if I'm bored yеt, I say to you

But I'm not going anywhere
'Cause I got all I need right here
If I'm cooped up with you

Right up underneath your arm
There's nothing to miss out on
If I'm cooped up with you
Yeah, I'm cooped up with you

There's a whole lot of world out there
But I'm not going anywhere
'Cause I got all I need right here
